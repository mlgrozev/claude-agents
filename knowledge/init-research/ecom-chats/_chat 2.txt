[15.11.24, 22:52:38] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: hello brothers
[15.11.24, 22:53:02] ~ Mark: Welcome bro
[15.11.24, 23:08:48] ~ Ben Mansour: If many of your ads keep rejecting yes
[15.11.24, 23:42:07] ~ Alex Lever: It’s usually fine but I’d create a separate ad account for the other product
[16.11.24, 0:21:38] ~ Samy: Because it can mess up the performance? Have you done this for your own stores.
[16.11.24, 0:27:15] ~ Joshua: Anyone working with REDO for returns?
[16.11.24, 0:46:43] ~ Charles: Anyone doing subscription here at mid - high level?
[16.11.24, 0:57:45] ~ Alex Lever: Yeah I run multiple products on different ad accounts. I’ve never ran multiple on one ad account as I’ve heard it hinders performance
[16.11.24, 0:58:06] ~ Christopher Murphy: Different pixels as well?
[16.11.24, 1:27:18] ~ Alex Lever: Nah same pixel. It’s usually fine if the avatar is similar in my experience. But it’s probably not optimal though
[16.11.24, 2:46:06] ~ Aman: Anyone here doing supplements? If so, custom formula or private label?
[16.11.24, 2:46:45] ~ Aman: Want to get into the market but don't want to spend $30k on initial batch with custom stuff
[16.11.24, 2:47:37] ~ HLR: https://supliful.com
[16.11.24, 2:47:48] ~ HLR: Testing out these guys
[16.11.24, 3:10:23] ~ Aman: I tried shipping times so bad
[16.11.24, 3:11:57] ~ Parker Godfrey: How many of you are using a Chinese 3PL for world wide shipping? What are the pros and cons? 

I’m currently ordering my custom product and having it shipped to the US and only targeting US.
[16.11.24, 3:54:52] ~ Mason Schulze: Which country are you shipping to and it's slow with Supiful?
[16.11.24, 3:59:51] ~ Twizzylit: Send stock to the US and then just have some in China for worldwide
[16.11.24, 3:59:58] ~ Twizzylit: We have that for one of my brands
[16.11.24, 4:01:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Anybody hitting product tests on meta easily? What's the best strategy currently? I am right now doing 1 CBO 1 ad set highest volume and spamming 8-12 creatives.
[16.11.24, 4:01:54] ~ Parker Godfrey: US 3PL for TikTok Shop orders or just for quicker shipping times? There are some 3PLs in china saying they can get orders to customers in 3-10 days for comparable prices as domestic USPS
[16.11.24, 4:04:17] ~ HLR: Their US shipping ok. 2-4 days standard
[16.11.24, 4:58:11] ~ Mike Kasdorf: We're also in the process of testing supliful. US shipping seems OK so far.
[16.11.24, 5:05:21] ~ Wouter: What niches are you guys all in?
[16.11.24, 5:05:29] ~ Wouter: And building a longterm brand or dropshipping?
[16.11.24, 5:26:29] ~ Parker Godfrey: One fashion brand and one beauty/personal care brand. Both long term
[16.11.24, 5:42:38] ~ Wouter: Good numbers?
[16.11.24, 5:42:42] ~ Mikael: anyone using Airwallex with Funnelish? we have some errors with this connection
[16.11.24, 10:27:38] ~ Gideon: Anyone has experience with loyalty programs? I want to start 1 with my store. If so do you have any best practices or things to be aware of
[16.11.24, 10:28:27] ~ Ateeb Shahdhar: How do I prevent my stores appearing on spytools?
[16.11.24, 10:29:16] ~ Parker Godfrey: I know headless sites don’t show
[16.11.24, 10:42:53] ~ Malik: Hey guys, I have a quick tip or just something I tested that worked extremely well - I've created a script with 2 people talking. In the hook I used the voice of my target demographic saying something in the lines of "I want your product but I've already been scammed online and don't want to risk it...." then I answer all the objections within the script + sell the product and offer
[16.11.24, 10:54:31] ~ Davide: Never seen someone like that, interesting! 
Can you explain better how do you manage the 2 people voices please?
[16.11.24, 11:52:59] ~ Malik: I just create/use 2 separate voices on Eleven Labs
[16.11.24, 12:05:57] ~ Gord JB: Can eleven labs combine two voices in a project? Or you have to manually combine two? 
To replicate a conversation 

Nice idea 💡
[16.11.24, 12:07:44] ~ Gord JB: We combine hey gen avatar with eleven labs voice 
Then into runway for clips over the avatar talking 

Works well
[16.11.24, 12:07:51] ~ Malik: I did it manually yes
[16.11.24, 12:09:31] ~ Gord JB: I’m sure there could be an automated way for that 

Maybe in eleven labs pipeline 

Could get a bit scary 😆
[16.11.24, 17:04:29] ~ Mikael: Anyone who built a strong stripe from scratch? With a totally new company and structure
[16.11.24, 18:10:51] ~ Robert: It's expensive af. The pros are you don't have to handle shipping. The cons are you will pay a lot for sales, usually around $1 per item. If you're a business that does B2B wholesale then you will be paying A LOT for the wholesale orders. Even after negotiation you will probbaly only be able to slice price by half for wholesale. If you can handle opening your own warehouse and hiring someone fulltime, it's a much cheaper option depending on how many orders you do per day.

[16.11.24, 19:28:16] ~ Zsombor: Does anyone have experience with Statrys as a bank account for HK company? Trying to diversify by getting more than one bank account. (We currently use Currenxie which has been great so far)
[16.11.24, 19:49:28] ~ Joshua: Who is saying this? Super interested
[16.11.24, 20:42:53] Amit Wadhawan: Hi all. Does anyone have any recommendations for an animator to create animations for VSLs?
[16.11.24, 21:21:55] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Use airwallex can be a good option, also Payoneer offers banking services for HK i believe

[16.11.24, 23:33:17] ~ Robert: Anyone here doing mainly advertising on TIktok? I'm used to FB but want to start running ads on tiktok. Is broad just as strong for Tiktok? Whats the go-to strat for tiktok?
[16.11.24, 23:38:40] ~ Mert M: yeah broad
[16.11.24, 23:39:01] ~ Robert: That simple there too?
[16.11.24, 23:39:08] ~ Robert: Good to know, thanks
[16.11.24, 23:39:10] ~ Mert M: yea

[16.11.24, 23:39:49] ~ Mert M: that's what works for us
[16.11.24, 23:40:00] ~ Robert: Will do, thank you

[17.11.24, 8:14:03] ~ Mason Schulze: Does anyone know of some brands killing it with statics for Supps
[17.11.24, 8:18:23] ~ Mithiran: Yeah, its really expensive. And it will affect your returning customer rate because people hate that its coming from China.

Would recommend transitioning over to a USA 3PL as soon as possible but its pretty good for validating a product or validating multiple regions worldwide
[17.11.24, 8:19:42] ~ Bryan T: How much cheaper is your USA 3pl than china? Had one before and it was much more expensive
[17.11.24, 8:29:06] ~ Huron: Thanks Alex! Much appreciated!!
[17.11.24, 8:30:45] ~ Huron: Super cool stuff man. You’re running this for your own brand?
[17.11.24, 8:42:00] ~ Mithiran: Not that big of a difference in terms of actual dollar amount. Like couple dollars difference. But it makes a big impact on our gross margin, around 4-5% increase in gross margin. It goes from around 72% gross margin (from China) to 77% gross margin (from USA)
[17.11.24, 9:19:22] ~ Parker Godfrey: I spoke to this company called ecomflow that promised 3-10 business days China to USA. No storage fees, with $1 pick pack. Would be $6.55avg for an 8oz package. Has any one seen anything comparable to this?
[17.11.24, 9:39:54] ~ Dr Zied: Hey guys 
How you deal with the regulations to ship supplements from China to UK. Any recommendations for a 3PL agency could help for that?
[17.11.24, 11:19:04] ~ Michael: Thats a new product Im running additional to my other products
[17.11.24, 11:24:56] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Drop shipping or private label?
[17.11.24, 11:25:42] ~ Michael: That product is deop shipping but we also have private label

[17.11.24, 11:51:15] ~ harshil Thummar: I have more than 5000 products for my brand is it good to do catalogue ads or reels ads?
[17.11.24, 11:56:43] ~ Filippo: Yes definitely catalog ads, is working very well for us in autopilot and we only have 30 products
[17.11.24, 11:59:48] ~ harshil Thummar: Single country or multiple country
[17.11.24, 11:59:52] ~ harshil Thummar: And what daily budget
[17.11.24, 12:00:21] ~ harshil Thummar: Because lately around election ads are very low performing for me
[17.11.24, 12:10:23] ~ Filippo: We’re running single country, for the budget it depends on how much are you spending and how much traffic comes into your store, you can start with a low budget something like a few tens of euros and increase it gradually if it works good
[17.11.24, 12:10:51] ~ harshil Thummar: Great
[17.11.24, 12:23:05] ~ Gideon: How do you structure the catalog ads? I do it know with  adv+ and cap existing customers at 5 or 10%. It works fine. Whats your best practice?
[17.11.24, 12:47:10] ~ Filippo: I do 100% retargeting with it, so simple cbo and on the adset level we retarget people that added to cart or viewed the product in the last 30 days
[17.11.24, 12:52:36] ~ Gideon: Okay. And then you show them your full catalogue. Or you made a collection of the bestsellers?
[17.11.24, 13:08:50] ~ Filippo: Yes full catalogue, since it’s 100% retargeting it’s dynamic so it is shown to all the people that interact with the products automatically
[17.11.24, 14:16:50] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone else finding overall performance worse this year Q4 compared to last?
[17.11.24, 15:22:01] ~ harshil Thummar: Yes
[17.11.24, 18:29:59] ~ Robert: Is library.tiktok.com what everyone is using to check ads on tiktok or is there a better option? This doesn't seem that great.
[17.11.24, 18:30:20] ~ Steve: pipiads
[17.11.24, 18:30:29] ~ Steve: and kalodata for tiktokshop
[17.11.24, 18:30:40] ~ Steve: spying on tiktok shop is god tier advantage
[17.11.24, 18:30:59] ~ Steve: you get to see the most organic shit that is scaling and how much money creators make for brands, then just swipe their hooks and angles
[17.11.24, 18:31:37] ~ Robert: Thank you 🤝 will look into both
[17.11.24, 18:34:17] ~ Denis Mihin: I want to know aswell
[17.11.24, 18:38:01] ~ Robert: Is it even worth advertising on TikTok if I dont have TikTok shop?
[17.11.24, 18:38:23] ~ Steve: yes
[17.11.24, 18:38:48] ~ Steve: ads you can run from any country, no restriction and we see great reach there for less spend
[17.11.24, 18:39:05] ~ Steve: but you have to be more aggressive, good news is anything that hits on tiktok will take off on facebook usually
[17.11.24, 18:43:00] ~ Asch: How do you guys deals with patent issues?
[17.11.24, 18:43:00] ~ Robert: When you say more aggressive do you mean drop more creatives? Also should my tiktok account have tons of organic content or does it not matter just like on fb?
[17.11.24, 18:43:17] ~ Steve: More aggressive creatives

[18.11.24, 1:06:14] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Great man, which niche?
[18.11.24, 1:09:09] ~ Michael: we Keep it very simple actually. we do 5 adsets for testing With 3 Creatives. 1x Broad 1x eng. shoppers 3x interests. duplicate bestperformer interest With new Creatives / angles and surfscale the ads during the day. 

We have Creative Systems to replicate the ad blocks for max Output. until today we already had around 100 Creatives running. tomorrow it will be probalby 150
[18.11.24, 1:09:50] ~ Michael: then switch to Broad after a while ‎<This message was edited>
[18.11.24, 1:10:45] ~ Michael: this product is actually home/decor niche. great for christmas

[18.11.24, 2:01:09] ~ Aaron Ware: What sort of profit margins are you guys taking in? I’m fluctuating between 20-30% net. 

What’s standard in income doing over 1M/mo ?
[18.11.24, 2:04:04] ~ Nebil: I’m fluctuating around 18-22%  I’m pacing to about 1.5-2 mill this month ‎<This message was edited>
[18.11.24, 2:05:03] ~ M: you guys done any CRO to try improve it?
[18.11.24, 2:05:38] ~ Michael: With HK ?
[18.11.24, 2:09:38] ~ Nebil: just a few offer tests were planning on testing higher price points as well as bundle since we think our AOV is the reason for our margins being a bit low
[18.11.24, 2:10:16] ~ M: ahhh okay thats good stuff
[18.11.24, 2:11:05] ~ M: if you wanna take it further just install GA4 and heatmaps look for big drop off points, where people click, scroll to, etc and come up with some tests you can run there as well
[18.11.24, 2:11:11] ~ Nebil: Nah regular PayPal and Shopify payments. We have a lot on reserve, but we’re using a meta credit line on a net 30 and they allow us to pay the bill 60 days later so it helps cashflow so I can work with the holds for now ‎<This message was edited>
[18.11.24, 2:35:12] ~ Chris: What are you guys using for fb tracking?
[18.11.24, 2:41:10] Bob: Wetracked.io, has been working good for us
[18.11.24, 2:50:10] ~ Aaron Ware: Can this do multiple meta ad accounts at the same time ? Or just the one?
[18.11.24, 2:51:06] ~ Erne: Yes you can. Also more stores.
[18.11.24, 2:53:14] ~ Erne: Where do you guys look for video editors and what’s your hiring process? Do you give them a sort of test test before hiring?
I give them a very detailed test brief with a bunch of examples, but they make very bad works. I’ve been having hard times find a good one. ‎<This message was edited>
[18.11.24, 3:01:21] Bob: Mainly onlinejobs for us. We give them a very short trial task where they basically just create a lead to keep the barrier of creating this low as it is a free test. 

Then if we think they look decent we give them a paid longer task to do and do revisions on this. Based on the basic skills and on how good they can implement revisions we proceed with interviews and then onboard them if we see they have potential to become great editors.
[18.11.24, 3:08:01] ~ Samy: Great system👌🏻. Since you can make so many different new videos from the same few videos and scripts, you don’t have to constantly source new ugc and content to be able to maintain scale right? I mean at least for a long time.
[18.11.24, 3:11:31] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Wow bro amazing what niche?
[18.11.24, 3:11:45] ~ Nebil: Beauty
[18.11.24, 3:21:53] ~ Michael: Yes create new voiceovers and use A/B Rolls from several creators. Gives Social proof aswell and works great for us. 
But also combine with ugc / image creatives etc
[18.11.24, 3:22:31] ~ A: What's your aov
[18.11.24, 3:29:34] ~ Samy: Alright! How do you handle creative fatigue once the sales get past 1 million euro and sales start dipping. Do you just spam test new content until something works ? And at what point do you decide to move on to another product.
[18.11.24, 3:32:06] ~ Michael: Will answer tmr G. Its 2.30 am on my side . Good night
[18.11.24, 3:34:46] ~ Samy: Thanks bro! Good night
[18.11.24, 3:45:36] ~ Wouter: What countries are you targetting?
[18.11.24, 4:37:08] ~ Mason Schulze: Who's been to China in here to look for products, any tips on the best areas to go to look?
[18.11.24, 7:27:47] Topi: Canton fair in guanzhagou
[18.11.24, 7:28:29] Topi: Are you looking for product ideas or what do you mean by products?
[18.11.24, 7:33:44] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh just want to go find new products to sell
[18.11.24, 7:58:33] Topi: For us the approach would be 

1. Find the products online using tools to measure historical data, timing, opportunity size

2. Go to china to find / create better, more unique version of the existing product


The only way to find new products just randomly from china is to go to some supplier warehouse and see whats winning there or visit factories and ask their catalogues. But tbh all this you can more easy do from home
[18.11.24, 7:58:53] Topi: Then ofc you have canton fair but its also 90% of improved version of existing products
[18.11.24, 7:59:23] Topi: Maybe im missing out on something, this is my knowledge now visiting china twice within 6-7 months
[18.11.24, 8:03:26] ~ Wouter: We just came back from China visiting our factories and farms
[18.11.24, 8:03:31] ~ Wouter: We do skincare and supplements
[18.11.24, 9:56:43] ~ Malik: This is really great for a business especially at that scale
[18.11.24, 13:28:38] ~ Reus: Do you guys use hk setup for payments? I cant go over 20k/day without holds, also i get 100% holds
[18.11.24, 13:35:02] ~ M: hk set ups stand for hong kong?
[18.11.24, 13:38:36] ~ Tijn Fortuin: In HK you have still holds
[18.11.24, 13:39:26] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Most of the time an settlement with Airwallex, pp always also rolling reserve
[18.11.24, 13:48:42] ~ Marcos García: Somebody doing good numbers on the US with branded dropshipping? Hit me for exchange information
[18.11.24, 13:52:59] ~ ….: What numbers you are at?
[18.11.24, 13:53:56] ~ Marcos García: 15-20k
[18.11.24, 15:00:02] ~ Jonny: Anyone here from the UK? Got some questions regarding VAT
[18.11.24, 15:15:29] ~ Zsombor: What holds you get? Payment processor? If so which payment processor?
[18.11.24, 15:36:07] ~ Zsombor: Dropshipping?

[18.11.24, 17:50:04] ~ Mikael: The money sitting is not th e problem. The problem is that we want and need a working stripe for funnelish for example
[18.11.24, 17:51:38] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I think you can still go for Ecom plug or if you have any good lawyer in contact, they possibly get your account back too if it's not a huge issue from your side like high disputes or sudden disputes hike

[18.11.24, 20:59:31] ~ Steve: Across the board. 3-4x roas
[18.11.24, 21:00:17] ~ Ben Mansour: If someone wants a good customer support agent dm me

[18.11.24, 21:04:50] ~ Erne: My CR in the last 2 days went up like crazy
[18.11.24, 21:04:51] ~ Steve: And just hasn't stopped
[18.11.24, 21:04:57] ~ Erne: From 4.5 to 8/9%
[18.11.24, 21:05:18] ~ M: Damn
[18.11.24, 21:05:34] ~ Erne: Zero changes. Same offer, and I don’t have even put the Black Friday deal
[18.11.24, 21:05:56] ~ Steve: I'd get that black Friday stuff live
[18.11.24, 21:06:19] ~ Steve: Even statics we ran with black Friday popped
[18.11.24, 21:06:31] ~ Erne: I split tested last week but lost VS the control. Do you think is time to put it back?
[18.11.24, 21:08:24] ~ Steve: We did, on our statics we ran essentially exact same wining statics just changed black Friday on them. Working pretty good
[18.11.24, 21:08:31] ~ Steve: But the other ones still live too because they work
[18.11.24, 21:09:09] ~ Erne: What vertical are you in if you don’t mind me asking ?

[18.11.24, 21:40:26] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Reamze works great for us, zendesk or gorgias also great. But way more expensive
[18.11.24, 21:40:42] ~ Nikita: thank you
[18.11.24, 21:40:45] ~ Charles: Gorgias
[18.11.24, 21:41:33] ~ Nikita: thank you ill check all those out
[18.11.24, 21:43:30] ~ M A N U E L: Richpanel also good
[18.11.24, 21:56:23] ~ Žan: Use richpanel, gorgias is overpriced
[18.11.24, 22:20:05] ~ Nikita: appreciate it gentlemen🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[18.11.24, 22:26:26] ~ Davide: anyone has tried makeugc to create different AI UGCs video ad? What’s your alternative for creating AI UGCs video ads?
[19.11.24, 1:43:31] ~ Robert: AI UGC, just isn't a good thing to do tbh. UGC is cheap af. If you can't profit actually paying for real UGC, you probably need to work on other things. People feel disrespected being sold by AI so it's not a great look for your brand.
[19.11.24, 2:57:46] ~ Mason Schulze: Guys, what would you do in this situation: 

I started a brand with a wellness device around 2 years ago and built a strong brand name for the product. 

Have a US TM application for that brand name but not registered yet.

The product itself is only made by one factory in China.

Battling atm with 100s of other sellers now advertising the same product and using my brand name which I created  and established the product with.

The factory said they would give me exclusivity to the supply of the product if i purchased 30,000 units per month, eliminating all of the other competition. However, our sales are only around 10,000 units per month at the moment, most likely due to all the other competitors selling our same product for less.
[19.11.24, 3:00:13] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Brother you didn't do any sort of product development in those 2 years and are you selling only in 1 country ?
[19.11.24, 3:00:25] ~ A: What platform are the other sellers selling on?
[19.11.24, 3:05:29] ~ Mason Schulze: Amazon, Ebay, Google MC, Walmart
[19.11.24, 3:05:51] ~ A: Not sure about the other platforms but u can take them down on amazon
[19.11.24, 3:05:57] ~ Mason Schulze: I customised the packaging and upgraded the devices internal components
[19.11.24, 3:06:07] ~ A: Even tho ur TM is pending
[19.11.24, 3:19:06] ~ Mason Schulze: Trying to work out how to do that because I don't have an Amazon Seller account, I was restricted from selling on Amazon before I even managed to create a listing.
[19.11.24, 3:21:05] ~ Denis Mihin: Same shit
[19.11.24, 3:25:57] ~ Al: Reach out to NawProtect
[19.11.24, 3:26:22] ~ Al: They helped us a lot with this but we actually were on Amazon so idk if it'll be as easy in your case
[19.11.24, 3:26:42] ~ Al: Pretty sure you can still register a brand and a pending trademark regardless of selling on Amazon or not
[19.11.24, 3:28:27] ~ Al: If you didn't invent the device you really don't have much ground to try take other people down. You can report people stealing your content as that's IP but it's not worth your effort trying to take people down bc they sell the same product you sell unless you have patents
[19.11.24, 3:28:53] ~ Al: Your effort is better put on becoming better. Better at ads, better at product, better at systems
[19.11.24, 3:29:46] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh it's not about the product it's the Brand name that made they are stealing
[19.11.24, 3:29:56] ~ Al: You can have a VA doing DMCAs and Meta takedowns to people stealing your store/images/copy/ads
[19.11.24, 3:30:11] ~ Al: Oh yeah that's fucked you can definitely take that down if they're on Amazon
[19.11.24, 3:30:18] ~ Al: Oh hey Mason haha I didn't see it was you
[19.11.24, 3:30:19] ~ Mason Schulze: Haven't had that issue, only Amazon, Ebay and Google MC
[19.11.24, 3:30:24] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey bro haha
[19.11.24, 3:30:50] ~ Al: Do a quick GPT rap see if you can register your brands pending trademark with Amazon. I'm pretty sure you can even if you don't sell there
[19.11.24, 3:31:03] ~ Al: Then just do that, and then contact NawProtect and tell them the situation
[19.11.24, 3:31:45] ~ Muhammad Hamza: You can register a pending trademark with Amazon brand registry but you should have a active product listing live on Amazon first.
[19.11.24, 3:31:51] ~ Al: You can manually report them but honestly it's not the best use of your time and these guys are fffffast
[19.11.24, 3:31:51] ~ Erne: When do you think is time do differentiate your product when your when your brand is start having some traction? I mean improving it, having a custom packaging etc

At what stage? ‎<This message was edited>
[19.11.24, 3:32:17] ~ Al: Are you 100% sure? I seem to remember I registered our brand and TM before we sold on Amazon
[19.11.24, 3:33:09] ~ Al: Custom packaging as soon as you've been profitable for a couple of weeks straight imo that should be the quickest thing to do
[19.11.24, 3:33:29] ~ A: I registered brand TM before selling on Amazon too
[19.11.24, 3:33:30] ~ Al: Improving the product as soon as you can after that especially of it isn't amazing
[19.11.24, 3:33:31] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Yups, Been doing this since 2020.

But that only allows you to be the owner of brand on Amazon and you can kick off any hijackers selling on Amazon using your brand name but not off Amazon.
[19.11.24, 3:34:15] ~ Al: Yeah part his problem is in amzn tho
[19.11.24, 3:34:43] ~ Mason Schulze: I tried to look up NawProtect couldn't see anything
‎[19.11.24, 3:34:53] ~ Al: ‎image omitted
[19.11.24, 3:35:14] ~ Erne: Do you have some suggestions? I’m in skincare and I’ve never done something like that. Should I contact directly the manufacturing or is enough to talk with my supplier? I’ve always done Spartan Dropshipping lol that’s a new whole world for me.
[19.11.24, 3:35:21] ~ A: They rebranded as seller pickle
They are Very effective in removing hijackers from your listing
[19.11.24, 3:35:34] ~ Al: They rebranded https://sellerpickle.com/
[19.11.24, 3:36:05] ~ Al: Your supplier meaning your agent?
[19.11.24, 3:36:10] ~ Erne: Yep my agent
[19.11.24, 3:36:12] ~ Al: Your agent/supplier should be able to facilitate this
[19.11.24, 3:36:26] ~ Al: If they can't, hit me up. My agent 100% will and will most likely beat your suppliers price
[19.11.24, 3:36:58] ~ Erne: Thanks man appreciate it. I imagine Do you guys run brands
[19.11.24, 3:37:11] ~ Erne: What are the most important things to focus on early stages in your opinion ? ‎<This message was edited>
[19.11.24, 3:38:11] ~ Erne: When trying to build something more long term I mean and not just a quick cash cow
[19.11.24, 3:39:36] ~ Al: yep but we started dropshipping dw
[19.11.24, 3:39:36] Alex  Fedotoff: You should connect with @⁨Greg Sourcing China Trybello⁩ he can help you out to source any product from 100s that he has access to
[19.11.24, 3:40:18] ~ Al: imo, in this order: ads, cro, customer experience, product
[19.11.24, 3:40:42] ~ Erne: Thanks Alex. These are Manufactured in US or china? ‎<This message was edited>

[19.11.24, 6:58:12] ~ harshil Thummar: For my brand it pretty low it didn't back up from last 20 days ads getting worse on Facebook for me
[19.11.24, 9:19:11] ~ Mason Schulze: Is anyone pulling the "no returns on sale items" card in their return policy's.
[19.11.24, 9:19:24] ~ A: Yes
[19.11.24, 9:19:44] ~ A: Too many emails asking about that
[19.11.24, 9:20:05] ~ Mason Schulze: Is it hidden in your terms?
[19.11.24, 9:20:31] ~ A: I mean
[19.11.24, 9:20:41] ~ Mason Schulze: Because I offer a 100 day Money back guarantee on the landing page, but contemplating putting that into the terms
[19.11.24, 9:21:41] ~ A: O misunderstood your question
 
No return on sale items was already in the generic return policy that Shopify generates

Got too many questions asking about that

So we deleted it
[19.11.24, 9:21:56] ~ Mason Schulze: Ah ok
[19.11.24, 16:20:21] ~ Zsombor: Any suggestions for HK paypal setup besides Ecomplug? Would be grateful for any contacts.

[19.11.24, 18:10:14] ~ Michael: What do u mainly use? Klarna?
[19.11.24, 18:12:17] ~ Nikita: i would get a few va’s and a burner shopify account and just throw out dmcas left and right
[19.11.24, 18:13:34] ~ Jonny: Removed it around 8 hours ago
[19.11.24, 18:14:11] ~ Zsombor: FB definitely needs more time to reoptimize
[19.11.24, 18:14:18] ~ Zsombor: it might take a few days
[19.11.24, 18:14:24] ~ M: yh
[19.11.24, 18:14:39] ~ M: Did you remove it because they hold payment?

[19.11.24, 20:57:45] ~ Giu: It’s working for me
[19.11.24, 21:08:27] ~ Timotej: Yo guys! 

Excited to be part of this!

I have pet supplement brand - mostly doing acquisition via advertorial and VSL funnels (EU market only). 

Right now I’m have a small team of 4 media buyers - one media buyer for each channel where we run camps.

One month ago we launched first Google DEMAND GEN campaigns … 

And traffic is quality, and very cheap … I can compare traffic quality/conversion-rates to what we see on good days on Taboola/Outbrain.  

… but i noticed that traffic is very volatile … 

I guess because algo shows on different days our ads on YT, Gmail and probably also elsewhere. 

Anyone else runs here Demand Gen campaigns? 

I’m happy to share what we have learned so far …
[19.11.24, 21:13:44] ~ Timotej: Here is what we have learnt so fat about DEGEN camps… Maybe someone will find this useful 

- don’t touch campaigsn minimum 3 days (first two days are usually shit)
- ⁠In the beginning CTR/CPM/CPM can fluctuate a lot
- ⁠VSL and Advertorials can be last-click profitable
- ⁠ On one smaller EU market … best campaign was running 2 months without touching it 
- ⁠When campaign stop performing, create a new ad … 
- ⁠When testing new funnel … this is the struvture that works the best for us: One camp —> 3 adgroups (broad, inmarket, LLA PUR5%) … after a few days, pause unprofitable adsets
[19.11.24, 21:15:05] ~ Timotej: If anyone else runs DEGEN … I would be happy if you share some insights … currently Im trying to find the fastest way hot to scale campaign to $500/day … still struggling tho 😀
[19.11.24, 21:28:23] ~ M: Pretty nice insights
[20.11.24, 0:39:41] ~ Steve: Anyone have contact for good Amazon team or freelancer that can handle getting our brand on Amazon quickly?
[20.11.24, 0:40:07] ~ Steve: We have the TM in process so we're gonna get these copy cats taken down but then we want to make sure we're up there with our brand too
[20.11.24, 0:47:58] ~ Al: I'd be careful to launch without an approved TM @⁨~Steve⁩ it was a nightmare for us. It's not just copycats, it's hijackers that can actually sell through your listing
[20.11.24, 0:48:13] ~ Al: Unless your TM is approved, you can only react to these issues. You can't prevent them
[20.11.24, 0:48:46] ~ Mason Schulze: Albert by approved do you mean approved application or approved registration of TM
[20.11.24, 0:48:59] ~ Al: So every few days a bunch of turds sell their knock offs through your listing to your potential customers for cheaper, until you go and report them and wait for Amazon to kick them out
[20.11.24, 0:49:07] ~ Al: Approved registration
[20.11.24, 0:49:26] ~ Al: Basically you wanna be able to be in Project Zero and Brand Transparency
[20.11.24, 0:50:10] ~ Al: You can only do that with a registered TM and that's the only way (that I know of) that Amazon won't let people hijack your listing
[20.11.24, 0:50:28] ~ Mason Schulze: How about just for approved applications You can't use that for anything? ‎<This message was edited>
[20.11.24, 0:50:53] ~ Al: Surely there are Amazon killers here that can shed more light on it, that was our experience and why we had to back tf out
[20.11.24, 0:51:16] ~ Al: You can use a pending TM (approved application) to report someone using your TM or to kick people out of your listing
[20.11.24, 0:51:19] ~ Al: But not to prevent it
[20.11.24, 0:51:29] ~ Mason Schulze: Ah got it
[20.11.24, 0:51:41] ~ Mason Schulze: The brand registry on Amazon
[20.11.24, 0:51:44] ~ Al: They act fast and they keep popping back they're a fucking plague
[20.11.24, 0:52:08] ~ Al: You can have brand registry with a pending TM but you can't have Project Zero and Brand Transparency
[20.11.24, 0:52:11] ~ Al: That's what you want
[20.11.24, 0:52:18] ~ Mason Schulze: Yep

[20.11.24, 2:29:00] ~ Samy: Thanks! What app do you use for this.
[20.11.24, 2:29:27] ~ Ben Mansour: None
[20.11.24, 2:29:37] ~ Ben Mansour: Shrine pro theme
[20.11.24, 2:29:42] ~ Ben Mansour: Has all these features
[20.11.24, 2:30:27] ~ Samy: Ahh okay I use the old debutify theme so can’t add that.
[20.11.24, 2:30:53] ~ Erne: Could be just the product that convert lower.

My 2 cents: your CR% Is mostly dictated from your creative
[20.11.24, 2:33:08] ~ Samy: It could be but don’t think so because I am scaling it in neighbor country and have also tried 2 different creatives, they have great cpc and ctr but it’s the conversion rate that’s messing it up.
[20.11.24, 3:04:03] ~ Parker Godfrey: I use UpCart
[20.11.24, 3:05:10] ~ Samy: Thanks, will check it out! What kind of settings and text do you use.
[20.11.24, 3:06:16] ~ Parker Godfrey: There’s a ton of functionality within it with built in cart upsells. I would just focus on adding scarcity/urgency and increasing AOV with the features in it.
[20.11.24, 3:07:26] ~ Samy: Do you recommend timers or that just looks scammy?
[20.11.24, 3:09:18] ~ Parker Godfrey: You can do it inside the app to make it look clean and non scammy. It’s a built in feature

then I would add a free shipping threshold too for AOV if you aren’t charging for shipping already. Start charging shipping then make a threshold for free shipping
[20.11.24, 3:11:32] ~ Samy: Got it, thanks🙌🏻
[20.11.24, 5:37:23] ~ Mason Schulze: What sort of shipping times everyone getting from China to US & EU
[20.11.24, 6:50:52] ~ Gordon: Does anyone else experience poor Facebook performance when they try to scale more than one product at the same time? It’s all on the same Shopify store.

Any ideas / workarounds for this ? I was thinking one product per ad account ? Thanks

[20.11.24, 10:00:36] ~ Ben Mansour: What's Applovin if you don't mind explaining? Never heard of it
[20.11.24, 10:38:28] ~ Al: Ads on apps like gaming apps etc
[20.11.24, 10:38:42] ~ Al: Google has the answers my friend
[20.11.24, 10:43:04] ~ Ben Mansour: Thanks
[20.11.24, 16:10:27] ~ Musawer: which one do you use 1-day click or 7-day click 1-day view? For facebook ads
[20.11.24, 16:34:53] ~ Sami: I use 7-day click and 1-day view, but you must compare them in the columns to see the realistic data. You can do it from columns > compare columns > 7-day click
[20.11.24, 16:35:12] ~ Sami: With the 1-day view it always reports much higher ROAS
[20.11.24, 16:51:15] ~ Jonathan Bach: Seeing great results optimizing for 1 day click only lately
[20.11.24, 17:30:32] ~ Marcos: with how much spend are you using 1d click?
[20.11.24, 17:44:23] ~ Mikael: Anyone know anybody who can fake docs for stripe? Or anyone who knows how to get a brand new stripe + company going?
[20.11.24, 17:56:19] ~ Ishroop: Yeah we’re actually going live with them next week
[20.11.24, 18:28:35] ~ Timotej: Do you maybe know if they have EU traffic from top-EU markets?
[20.11.24, 18:29:54] ~ Ishroop: Right now they only have USA ad inventory
[20.11.24, 18:30:04] ~ Ishroop: Think they will be opening up EU soon
[20.11.24, 18:30:43] ~ Timotej: Nice - great insights, thanks. Is Cathy your rep as well?
[20.11.24, 19:06:02] ~ Mikael: Anyone have any course or anything on how to create a strong stripe even after they disabled some?
[20.11.24, 21:52:42] ~ harshil Thummar: Any one using taboola , I m thinking to start ads on that so just want some insight
[20.11.24, 23:58:27] ~ Chris: Any recommendations for high quality ugc content/creators?
[21.11.24, 0:05:28] ~ Alex Lever: Yeah separating them out into different ad accounts is the way to go. If the products are targeting relatively similar avatars then it’s fine for the most part
[21.11.24, 0:08:08] ~ Gordon: Cheers Alex
[21.11.24, 0:54:44] ~ Aman: Hearing its great for AOV lower than $100 and avg ROAS of 2
[21.11.24, 2:05:37] ~ Al: heard the same around
[21.11.24, 2:29:14] ~ Imran: Is it really that important? Because I'm having lately bad performance on multiple different products that are being tested on the same ad acc (3 products per ad acc, health/beauty/gadgets ), and I'm not sure if it's because of this or sth else ‎<This message was edited>
[21.11.24, 2:52:12] ~ Robert: Hey does anyone get network errors when trying to login to Tiktok for business account? I've tried multiple ways of logging in but the 2FA never works.

[21.11.24, 3:49:03] ~ Aymane: Did you try a different browser ? sometimes it's just the browser problem

[21.11.24, 6:19:21] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey guys, what sort of process is best to test another non English speaking country (Spain)

My store is on shopify, and I just have one product page, I can't see how to do this just on the same store not sure if there is an app that will translate the slider cart and checkout just for those visitors?
[21.11.24, 6:55:41] ~ Ry: anyone noticed a huge dip on creative testing performance after the new meta BM interface?
[21.11.24, 6:56:04] ~ Wouter: Yes
[21.11.24, 6:56:05] ~ Wouter: 100%
[21.11.24, 6:56:13] ~ Wouter: What are you guys doing to change it around
[21.11.24, 6:56:21] ~ Wouter: we’ve been testing so much but CPC
[21.11.24, 6:56:29] ~ Wouter: ’s have never been so high
[21.11.24, 6:58:18] ~ Ry: Havent been able to get around it. Like hundreds of spend but 0 sale on creatives testing. never happened before
[21.11.24, 6:58:51] ~ Charles: When are you guys launching your BF ads? ‎<This message was edited>
[21.11.24, 7:00:45] ~ Mithiran: What kind of creatives are working for everyone right now? Is it mainly black friday sale ads? Or are your normal creatives still working?
[21.11.24, 7:34:54] ~ harshil Thummar: Yes huge
[21.11.24, 7:35:36] ~ Ry: how did you get around it?
[21.11.24, 7:36:30] ~ harshil Thummar: Like I m sticking to the basic right now but ads performance is very bad for me from past 2-3 weeks like never before
[21.11.24, 7:36:44] ~ harshil Thummar: Basics like simple catalogue ads
[21.11.24, 8:31:11] ~ Zsombor: Anyone had surprisingly poor fb ads performance the last couple of weeks?
‎[21.11.24, 8:32:50] ~ Timotej: ‎image omitted
[21.11.24, 8:33:26] ~ Zsombor: It's the opposite for us, but thank you It's interesting
[21.11.24, 8:37:38] ~ Parker Godfrey: It’s been really solid for us since launching BFCM ads. If you haven’t pushed BFCM ads im assuming your competitors are so it may be diluting you. Another thoery is if you aren’t running BFCM ads, Facebook recognizes that and CPMs will go up cuz they know customers are more likely to convert with your competitors right now (buyer intent). Our testing and evergreen campaigns are below target mainly cuz the sale is diluting those campaigns. We’re keeping our evergreen campaigns full with solid ads for when we have to turn off the BFCM ads to hedge against the post sale blues.
[21.11.24, 8:38:28] ~ Zsombor: Thank you, we will push BFCM more than! 🙏
[21.11.24, 8:41:05] ~ Timotej: Great tips - thanks for sharing!
[21.11.24, 8:50:31] ~ Mikael: Anyone know any Airwallex insider?
[21.11.24, 8:50:57] ~ Zsombor: Contact Remoove
[21.11.24, 9:27:35] ~ harshil Thummar: Yes 1000%
[21.11.24, 10:28:49] ~ Mithiran: By BFCM ads are you talking about mainly image ads with black friday sale on it? Or are they your evergreen top ads with a black friday sale headline?
[21.11.24, 10:31:44] ~ Gideon: We changed our website to bf sales and give just a few eur discount on some bestsellers and put a BF label on the images. First day worked great so far. Usual ads are crushing it. Today we'll add the black friday campaigns. Just take our best working creatives and put Black friday badges on it. Also a collection ad and carroussel ad with black friday badge on it. Now we test so we can scale next week like crazy
[21.11.24, 10:34:48] ~ Mithiran: Wdym black friday badges?
[21.11.24, 10:39:25] ~ Gideon: Just in the carroussel a small square image with a black friday badge in it. You can add this so it appears automatically in all the carroussel ads
[21.11.24, 10:43:13] ~ Mithiran: Ah okay, what about for video ads?
[21.11.24, 10:51:46] ~ Gideon: I just add a black friday sauce of the already good performing creatives
‎[21.11.24, 10:51:51] ~ Gideon: ‎image omitted
[21.11.24, 10:54:05] ~ Mithiran: Ahh amazing thanks man
[21.11.24, 12:16:20] ~ Samy: This is a banner at the top of the video right ?
[21.11.24, 12:17:09] ~ Gideon: Yes, correct
[21.11.24, 12:19:34] ~ Samy: Thanks will try this out aswell! So just by adding that to the ads that already work, and a black Friday badge to the images in the store you saw much better performance?
‎[21.11.24, 12:20:34] ~ Gideon: ‎image omitted
[21.11.24, 12:20:56] ~ Gideon: Yes, just added this with app selly to all the products that are in sale
[21.11.24, 12:21:05] ~ Gideon: with discount as well of course
[21.11.24, 12:24:27] ~ Samy: I assume you will let the ads with the Black Friday banners run until they don’t preform anymore, but how long will you keep the Black Friday discounts on the store?
[21.11.24, 12:29:52] ~ Gideon: Yes, Im now testing this ads and with bf whatever works I'll scale and the ad already has purchases and data. Is always better than launch it on Black Friday and pray
[21.11.24, 12:30:02] ~ Gideon: Until the day after cyber monday
[21.11.24, 12:34:27] ~ Samy: Got it, thanks🙌
[21.11.24, 12:35:27] ~ Mikael: Anyone know where to buy great conditioned Stripe accs?
[21.11.24, 12:36:29] ~ Ben Mansour: Just get another payment processor
[21.11.24, 12:37:47] ~ Mikael: Any processor you can recommend for funnelish?
[21.11.24, 13:50:16] ~ Alex Lever: It’s not always because of that but in my experience, and from what I’ve heard, it can impact performance. Maybe it’s worth separating them out into different ad accounts to see if that is the issue or not
[21.11.24, 14:37:03] ~ M A N U E L: You can try with HK structure + Airwallex
[21.11.24, 15:19:20] ~ M A N U E L: For who is using a “niched” fb page to advertise (different from brand name) that is not linked with any instagram account, how you manage the comments under the ads on the instagram side of thing?
[21.11.24, 15:43:53] ~ Mikael: Yes I have this now. But the rolling reserve and payouts are bad
[21.11.24, 16:15:43] ~ RS: Guys who use Airwallex+funnelish, when you sell to US, are your customers required to complete the 3DS? For me, Airwallex told that they cannot disable 3DS because of funnelish implementation. And this 3DS causes many customers to drop off
‎[21.11.24, 16:15:58] ~ RS: ‎image omitted
[21.11.24, 16:19:53] ~ Tom: Yeah I have also been trying to get them to disable it as we are having a high fail rate 30%+. But Funnelish say it’s an AirWallex issue and AirWallex say it’s a Funnelish issue.
[21.11.24, 16:21:38] ~ Ry: Its definitely on funnelish. Airwallex can disable 3ds on shopify.
[21.11.24, 16:26:46] ~ RS: Ah
[21.11.24, 16:27:25] ~ Zsombor: Are you guys here tend to disable 3ds on Shopify for more conv rate?
[21.11.24, 16:27:31] ~ AA: Whats the problem with using stripe hk?
[21.11.24, 16:28:27] ~ RS: I have European company. I use stripe now But they are placing holds and shutting down accs now, so no longer Trust stripe
[21.11.24, 16:29:02] ~ AA: Ok bro
[21.11.24, 17:41:56] ~ Steve: also on another topic… i have a FB question for you. I’m reaching out to everyone i know because I am dealing with something totally unprecedented. 

On nov 1st… like a switch flipped… our CPMs fell from ~$80 to $20 or less. 

We were excited… then all our conversions (checkout views, leads, purchases) just became 10x more expensive. 

We literally changed nothing, didn’t make any major moves in our account, october was a totally fine month, had new creative deployed etc 

we still havent fixed it 3 weeks later. 

We cant even understand it. 

Have you ever seen or heard of anything like that?
[21.11.24, 17:42:03] ~ Steve: Hey guys friend of mine sent me this
[21.11.24, 17:42:20] ~ Steve: Wondering if anyone here has any insights? It's been frustrating for him to figure out and I don't have good answers

[22.11.24, 5:48:57] ~ Tom: Thanks! 🙏
[22.11.24, 9:33:30] ~ Rahman: Only on retargering campaigns
[22.11.24, 9:38:41] ~ Gideon: I do it to get more control and it optimizes more for new sales. It makes cpa slightly lower but the profit will be higher. Better make a different retargeting campaign for hot audiences. For advantage + you can set your limit for existing customers on 2-10 %
[22.11.24, 11:59:10] ~ Samy: When you guys test new creatives for your stores, do you sometimes experience that when you launch to many new ads in relation to the budget, it just destroys the performance for the day?
[22.11.24, 11:59:55] ~ Lovro Knavs: Yep, usually gets stable than in 2-3 days after optimisation ‎<This message was edited>
[22.11.24, 11:59:56] ~ harshil Thummar: Yeah feel that
[22.11.24, 12:19:17] ~ Samy: Whats the best way to avoid this. To only launch a few ads each time?
[22.11.24, 12:52:26] ~ Lovro Knavs: I schedule them throughout a few best performing days of the week ‎<This message was edited>
[22.11.24, 12:52:39] ~ Gideon: Just accept it and when you have winners scale hard to earn it back. Dont let all the test ads rub to long. Although give everything a good chance
[22.11.24, 13:42:50] ~ Jonny: Anyone working with best fulfill and notice they have been increasing costs? Saying because it’s Xmas seasons the suppliers have increased prices etc
[22.11.24, 13:43:24] ~ Ben Mansour: Shipping prices incresee during q4 it's normal
[22.11.24, 13:43:59] ~ Jonny: And product prices?
[22.11.24, 13:44:27] ~ Ben Mansour: I don't work with them
[22.11.24, 13:44:31] ~ Ben Mansour: But product prices are same
[22.11.24, 13:44:38] ~ Ben Mansour: Only shipping increased a bit
[22.11.24, 13:55:11] ~ Num: I don’t understand why you guys are using agencies Go directly to the supplier they’re cheaper and you can negotiate the price and quality
[22.11.24, 14:00:42] ~ Marcos: But then you need to have a warehouse t ship it right ?
[22.11.24, 14:00:59] ~ Ben Mansour: To get the best costs
[22.11.24, 14:01:14] ~ Ben Mansour: Contact the original factory on alibaba
[22.11.24, 14:01:26] ~ Ben Mansour: And buy stock and send it to your supplier warehouse
[22.11.24, 14:01:32] ~ Ben Mansour: You just pay the supplier for shipping
[22.11.24, 14:02:39] ~ Num: The supplier can handle that for you—just provide them with the listing items, and they’ll take care of the rest
[22.11.24, 14:03:11] ~ Ben Mansour: Most of the times they upcharge
[22.11.24, 14:03:32] ~ Num: dont use alibaba
[22.11.24, 14:03:49] ~ Num: im in china ii know cheaper apps and websites

[22.11.24, 17:12:48] ~ Rahman: Anyone selling with Cash On Delivery?
[22.11.24, 17:18:50] ~ Bazeed: Yep
[22.11.24, 17:18:55] ~ Bazeed: I have a brand in India thats on cod
[22.11.24, 17:19:02] ~ Bazeed: ask away
[22.11.24, 17:21:02] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Where do you ship from?
[22.11.24, 17:21:11] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Bulk import from China or Indian manufacturers?
[22.11.24, 17:22:15] ~ Parker Godfrey: How much are you guys paying your Chinese 3PL for shipping to the US? I’m looking for a shipping partner in China who can ship individual orders to customers in the USA in 10 days or less…
[22.11.24, 17:22:54] ~ Bazeed: My suppliers are in India, India has a lot of really good suppliers and even cheaper than china which makes it really good for logistics
[22.11.24, 17:25:57] ~ Rahman: We sell in Europe and have a lot of RTO (return to origin) problems. (Customers change their mind and refuse to  pay and take the package)
How do you guys manage that?
[22.11.24, 17:26:09] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Omg that's something new I discovered
[22.11.24, 17:27:01] ~ Bazeed: have a call centre
[22.11.24, 17:27:08] ~ Bazeed: they confirm cod orders on call
[22.11.24, 17:30:22] ~ Bazeed: is it for an established brand or are u starting? ik some hypersku suppliers they were shipping for one of my stores to us in 5-6 days
[22.11.24, 17:30:25] ~ Bazeed: pricing was decent too
[22.11.24, 17:35:31] ~ Igor: Few years ago worked as affiliate with CoD offers in post Soviet countries. So yes, as Buzeed said - call center is a must with strong scripts. They do pre shipment calls and follow ups calls if package is not received(usually package is awaiting at courier service pick up points) 
Depends on your case - if your package is based at pick up points- follow up calls with potential discount is a solution, if you ship CoD directly to customer - then pre shipment + pre arrival call should be a solution.
[22.11.24, 17:39:41] ~ Bazeed: yeah u cant unfortunately completely get rid of rto but u can test offers as well where you incentivise towards using prepayment for additional 10% off, etc

and the higher your repeat rate is the lower the RTO goes and that means u gotta be branding well
[22.11.24, 17:52:00] ~ Timotej: Regarding COD …

By far the most important things to reduce rejection-rate:

1. shipping time - each day the customer waits longer, % of rejections increases
2. ⁠SMS sequence - be aggressive and send out daily 
3. ⁠carrier optimization… different EU markets, sometimes means different carriers

[22.11.24, 19:18:49] ~ Lucas Alves: running at whatsapp web
theres no need to use a plataform unless you have more than 1 person doing the job
[22.11.24, 19:19:14] ~ Lucas Alves: in that case i use umblertalk

[22.11.24, 19:27:18] ~ Lucas Alves: they have!
[22.11.24, 20:07:17] ~ N: Is opening a company and getting GST certificate easy for you

[22.11.24, 20:13:24] ~ N: Some guy in India was holding it for me
[22.11.24, 20:13:38] ~ N: Lost a lot of money to get it out of the country as you need certifications and stuff to leave money
[22.11.24, 20:14:18] ~ Bazeed: that was cod or card payments?
[22.11.24, 20:14:47] ~ N: COD
[22.11.24, 20:14:55] ~ N: 60% delivery rate
[22.11.24, 20:15:01] ~ N: I remember there was 2 states that had the best delivered rate
[22.11.24, 20:15:15] ~ N: I think it’s ideal to have a 3PL in each big state but issue was obtaining GST in each state
[22.11.24, 20:15:41] ~ Nikita: yeah india was hard for getting money out with cod lol, first day I tested there got 86 roas 😂

Basically very soon they don’t give the option to run purchase optimization ads if they categorise you as health and wellness.

[23.11.24, 10:43:21] ~ Num: you can PROCESS LIKE 50k$ of sales with anither payment provider then after all orders are deliverd switch to shopify payment
[23.11.24, 10:44:59] ~ Bazeed: so why not start with shopify payments day 1? with good CS and no chargebacks

[23.11.24, 11:10:47] ~ Num: no i used my name
[23.11.24, 11:12:08] ~ Bazeed: i did have an airwallex that got banned, by making a hk company with getstartked.hk and they refer you to airwallex.

[23.11.24, 11:21:55] ~ Num: getstarted only create HK company you should find a agency that create airwallex account
[23.11.24, 11:22:50] ~ Bazeed: yeah my partner forgot to put tracking numbers of orders and was fulfilling without it so they thought it was sus
[23.11.24, 11:22:53] ~ Vish: It's better to do it on a nominee name than to do on yours
[23.11.24, 11:22:56] ~ Bazeed: shoudlnt happen normally tho
[23.11.24, 11:24:46] ~ Vish: Do getstarted.hk connect you with Airwallex reps?
[23.11.24, 11:25:18] ~ Bazeed: yep u get an account manager from airwalle
[23.11.24, 11:25:39] ~ Vish: Okay, don't have experience with them
[23.11.24, 11:25:51] ~ Vish: But for me I got from someone else

[23.11.24, 11:33:23] ~ Tom: Anyone got stripe rep? 🙏
[23.11.24, 12:34:43] ~ Daniel: I have a lawyer who specializes in Stripe bans, he can get the money back and unban, but unban is not always possible
[23.11.24, 13:18:29] ~ Mithiran: Does anyone know a product page for a company selling a course? Looking for a product page to swipe
[23.11.24, 13:29:58] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: hey i was on 20k days and just got my ad account disabled, what do you guys recommend for facebook backend? (selling health btw)
[23.11.24, 13:42:29] ~ Mason Schulze: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[23.11.24, 14:01:07] ~ Alexander Sundström: Any good negotiation tips/advice here when dealing with Chinese suppliers? We have 3 different suppliers that we negotiate with, but the one we are using has by far always the best price and good quality products. The communication is not the best, slow sometimes. We have been able to get the price down with time, but we want to come lower. We have 30-50k inventory each month that we purchase, all products are customized and branded.
[23.11.24, 14:02:18] ~ Alexander Sundström: We heard that going to china is usually good, but haven’t been there yet
[23.11.24, 14:13:41] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: this is incredible, what do u recommend to navigate to first for someone who wants to master the basics of good copywriting + also any tips for that AI prompt training document to do it faster or will we have to use the whole 200 pages lol
[23.11.24, 14:14:10] ~ Matt: If you want to optimise for cashflow you can get better terms by mentioning sinosure insurance. This protects the supplier from default and usually results in up to 90-120 days net payment on 70% of balance after goods leave port. You then pay a 3-5% premium on this but it’s a lot cheaper then getting rev based finance and there’s no personal guarantees involved.
[23.11.24, 15:32:58] ~ Alexander Sundström: I appreciate that, we just want lower prices, cash flow is ok for now. We have come to a point where they won’t lower their prices. I know there is room to come down lower, but I can’t figure out how.
[23.11.24, 15:43:41] ~ Matt: You can ask to be quoted in RMB instead of $ as they usually use a poor conversion rate and it might be cheaper
[23.11.24, 16:20:19] ~ Alexander Sundström: Okay, I will try it
[23.11.24, 17:37:43] ~ Akansh: That shit is fire thanks man

[23.11.24, 21:53:03] ~ Henry: Hey Gs, how would you say is the best way to run BFCM statics for Retargeting?

ABO or CBO? What budget if ABO?
[23.11.24, 21:59:46] ~ Sami: Cbo and put types of creatives in ad sets. Videos into one, statics to other one etc. Then for every 3k you spend in the whole campaign time, have 3-5 creatives per ad set

I.e 3k per day spend for 7 days would be 7 batches of creatives
[23.11.24, 22:00:19] ~ Sami: If you're just doing statics and just retargeting, ABO/CBO doesn't matter imo
[23.11.24, 22:29:30] ~ Ben Mansour: just cbo and pump as much creatives as possible
[23.11.24, 22:30:07] ~ Ben Mansour: every idea you have put it in an adset, facebook will optimize and choose what to spend on
[23.11.24, 22:30:39] ~ Parker Godfrey: And only 1 CBO for the whole account?
[23.11.24, 22:31:12] ~ Ben Mansour: 1 cbo per country
[23.11.24, 22:31:45] ~ Ben Mansour: but for special sales like halloween sale / bf create another cbo
[23.11.24, 22:32:07] ~ Ben Mansour: with another offer preferably
[24.11.24, 1:05:49] ~ Alexander Sundström: Do you exclude audiences for your Black Friday campaigns? Like last 30 day purchases since the email marketing will hit those customers anyways
[24.11.24, 1:12:46] ~ Ben Mansour: Nope
[24.11.24, 1:13:11] ~ Ben Mansour: Many people buy again from bf fb ads
[24.11.24, 1:24:30] ~ Jonny: 1 CBO with 1 broad adset per country? ‎<This message was edited>
[24.11.24, 1:26:22] ~ Parker Godfrey: Anyone finding success with Cost Caps rn?
[24.11.24, 1:42:50] ~ Ilda: I wouldn’t use cost caps
[24.11.24, 1:43:04] ~ Ilda: Search up Charley the disrupter
[24.11.24, 1:43:08] ~ Ilda: He explains it all
[24.11.24, 1:44:11] ~ Ben Mansour: No multiple adsets, every new batch of creatives we have i put it in a new adset
[24.11.24, 1:44:20] ~ Ben Mansour: And dct for statics
[24.11.24, 1:46:37] ~ Ben Mansour: Also something that i noticed: when you duplicate a! adset inside the cbo in order to launch new ads always duplicate a bad performing adset or create a new one, duplicating winning one will drop its performance
[24.11.24, 2:20:08] ~ Wouter: What countries are you targeting?

[24.11.24, 9:52:41] ~ Filippo: We closed an agreement with ebanx for all the Latam payment methods, we would like to expand to Brazil and we have boleto available but I don't know if it's worth it. You said that you use only cc and pp. what do you think?
[24.11.24, 11:19:54] ~ Bazeed: hi guys, does anyone have a method for farming trustpilot reviews? i saw a site to buy online its like $580 for 100, but i think there must be a better alternative

[24.11.24, 11:27:58] ~ Musawer: What percentage of your daily budget do you plan to spend on Black Friday campaigns?
[24.11.24, 11:31:22] ~ Tom: Has anyone with HK company applied for a credit card?
[24.11.24, 11:49:55] ~ Gideon: Yes. Ill use inflated costcaps on bf campaigns. Now in testing different creatives. With the winners ill test which cc will perform the best and surfscale it. Also ads that were performing good and stopped performing. Ill check the total cpa. Put the costcap just a few bucks under it. Often it start performing again and spend the budget very efficiently with lower cost and good roas.
[24.11.24, 13:17:12] ~ Tom: Canva is the best in my opinion
[24.11.24, 13:29:45] ~ Gideon: What ai options u use the most in canva?
[24.11.24, 13:34:27] ~ Tom: They have an in build ai, but I usually just use chat gpt for canva when I want it to generate an image, and if that image needs some work then I go to Leonardo ai for better graphics. I also ask Chat gpt for questions in canva. 

Always seem to work.

[24.11.24, 15:09:02] ~ Lucas Alves: In Brazil we mostly use cc and PIX payment, i recommend you to dont use boleto

its a payment method that brings more problems than revenue 

thats because customers can generate a boleto and not pay it

just only use cc and pix and you ll be well served
[24.11.24, 15:09:56] ~ Lucas Alves: great framework
[24.11.24, 15:10:09] ~ Filippo: Oh we also have pix available! What about PayPal?

[24.11.24, 23:21:49] ~ Erne: but how do you monitor accurately which adset are taking the attribution in these cases? Cuz the roas is not updated in real time. You're using tw?
[24.11.24, 23:21:51] ~ Bazeed: @⁨~Michael⁩ for winner adsets would u just keep doubling/ tripling budget or would u duplicate horizontally?
[24.11.24, 23:22:10] ~ Bazeed: and dosent the adset go in learning phase with high increase or an i missing something?
[24.11.24, 23:23:24] ~ Michael: for this shop we just use utm tracking. if the adsets are good You dont Need real time tracking if You have a tracked 4+ roas already
[24.11.24, 23:23:59] ~ Michael: we do just scale the ABO adsets which work, just surf the adests without dublicating
[24.11.24, 23:24:20] ~ Michael: from our expirience there is no "learning Phase"
[24.11.24, 23:24:27] ~ Giu: @⁨~Michael⁩ we tried surfing strategy but our campaigns didnt spend the budget, how can we solve it?
[24.11.24, 23:25:34] ~ Michael: it does not spend the whole Budget You increase to during the day
[24.11.24, 23:25:40] ~ Bazeed: “surf the adsets without duplicating” 

can you explain how you do the surf? isnt it you duplicate the same adset with a very high budget
[24.11.24, 23:25:57] ~ Michael: if You want them to spend more just do 5x the budget
[24.11.24, 23:26:10] ~ Michael: and see if its still stable, if not, scale down to old budget
[24.11.24, 23:26:19] ~ Giu: Ok so it’s normal, thank you
[24.11.24, 23:26:41] ~ Michael: just double the Budget on good Performing adsets
[24.11.24, 23:26:46] ~ Michael: without doublicating
[24.11.24, 23:26:56] ~ Michael: just increse the daily Budget of them
[24.11.24, 23:27:10] ~ Bazeed: got it so u don’t scale horizontally

[24.11.24, 23:34:18] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Is this branded bro?
[24.11.24, 23:34:22] ~ Michael: yes lower it again, depends where You startet and ended. if the day was very good You can Keep it a bit higher than last day
[24.11.24, 23:34:36] ~ Michael: yes
[24.11.24, 23:35:06] ~ Michael: not really
[24.11.24, 23:35:12] ~ Michael: but shop Looks very branded
[24.11.24, 23:35:44] ~ Erne: @⁨~Michael⁩ whats your starting budget in these ABO's adsets and how many creatives do you put inside usually
[24.11.24, 23:36:02] ~ Erne: to keep that scale without mess up everything
[24.11.24, 23:36:23] ~ Michael: mostly 3 creatives
[24.11.24, 23:36:25] ~ Michael: same angle
[24.11.24, 23:36:31] ~ Ben Mansour: @⁨~Michael⁩ can you give us your framework for short vid ads that work well please
[24.11.24, 23:36:47] ~ Ben Mansour: Like hook + problem + 3 benefits + close
[24.11.24, 23:36:52] ~ Ben Mansour: Or something?
[24.11.24, 23:37:13] ~ Erne: 50$ starting budget?

CTA + Incentive (buy now and save 30%)

This is the structre for Creatives if we test new products ‎<This message was edited>
[24.11.24, 23:38:45] ~ Michael: 30-40 sec
[24.11.24, 23:38:56] ~ Michael: every 1-2 sec Cut/transistion to increase watchtime
[24.11.24, 23:39:11] ~ Ben Mansour: Thanks bro
[24.11.24, 23:39:59] ~ Michael: depends on product Price but 15-50
[24.11.24, 23:40:02] ~ Michael: per adset
[24.11.24, 23:40:24] ~ Erne: Thanks for the sauce man and sorry for many questions
[24.11.24, 23:40:57] ~ Michael: no worries bro
[25.11.24, 1:29:31] ~ Samy: So you only do ABO bro? Lets say you start with 15 dollar budget per adset, do you just keep doubling that everyday per adset if performance is good?
[25.11.24, 1:32:35] ~ Michael: I first oncreas to 30-50 and if still performs well I go to 100 and wait 1-2 days
[25.11.24, 1:33:13] ~ Michael: There is no strict goto it depends on the adsets how strong and stable they perform
[25.11.24, 1:34:58] ~ Samy: Any reason why you dont do CBOs?
[25.11.24, 1:38:56] ~ Samy: Will definitely try this out. I always duplicate because I thought it would mess up performance if I increase the daily budget on ABO directly.
[25.11.24, 1:59:37] ~ Lucas Alves: did you automate this?
[25.11.24, 1:59:41] ~ Lucas Alves: or doing manual?
[25.11.24, 2:01:22] ~ Tom: Hey guys, a quick question: How did you get to the point you are now? 

Of course grinding, discipline, putting in the work. But I mean like, what did you do after school, what kind of job, did you go to college etc? 

Just curious on how you all got to this point. ‎<This message was edited>

[25.11.24, 3:02:20] ~ Michael: Sure
[25.11.24, 3:04:01] ~ Muhammad Hamza: You do branded drop shipping mostly? 

What's your go to PR strategy/criteria? 

You prefer to ride on trends or long term problem solving products?

Do you test one product stores or multiple products together? ‎<This message was edited>
[25.11.24, 4:09:21] ~ Mason Schulze: Guys when your launching into new non English speaking countries with shopify are you creating a complete new store?
[25.11.24, 5:08:15] ~ Sean: Can someone explain what Native is to me
[25.11.24, 5:17:16] ~ Parker Godfrey: If a CBO is above target for over a week straight, do you still want to be constantly pumping new creative in?
[25.11.24, 5:20:19] ~ Twizzylit: Yes
[25.11.24, 6:11:10] ~ Bazeed: Taboola / outbrain ads. The ads you see on the news websites, these work great with older demographic ecom products
[25.11.24, 6:12:37] ~ Sean: Ahh okay thanks. I’ll do some more research into this
[25.11.24, 11:20:03] ~ Bazeed: does anyone have a plug for discounted first class flights? concierge or something?
[25.11.24, 12:18:57] ~ N: What niche you in
[25.11.24, 12:27:58] ~ Michael: We branded and unbranded if product is new.

We search for products in the US which are completely new and only 1 comp. Scaling it. Then we bring it to Europe 

We do both

We have multiple stores where we test products
[25.11.24, 12:28:16] ~ Michael: Outdoor
[25.11.24, 12:39:22] ~ N: What spy tool do u use?
[25.11.24, 12:39:28] ~ N: Thank you btw for sharing all of this
[25.11.24, 12:39:30] ~ N: Appreciate it
[25.11.24, 12:48:33] ~ Michael: Mostly I check ad library on daily base. Check the ads which are launched today
[25.11.24, 12:48:51] ~ N: How many products u got
[25.11.24, 12:57:27] ~ Rustam: Hey brother, appreciate you sharing your insights. If you don’t mind me asking, what are the payment methods that you’re using? Klarna, Sofort, etc.

Also, do you use native speakers to write and proofread the sales and ad copies, or is AI translation enough nowadays?

I have a couple winners that I want to test out in the German speaking market

Thanks beforehand
[25.11.24, 12:58:59] ~ Rustam: Also, do you collect VAT, etc, or can it be avoided if you have a US LLC?
[25.11.24, 13:02:38] ~ Michael: just a few ones
[25.11.24, 13:04:04] ~ Michael: we are german but i wouldnt recommend using AI honestly, Germans are very sceptical when it Comes to online Shopping. And We use Klarna, Sofort, CC, PayPal.
[25.11.24, 13:14:14] ~ Muhammad Hamza: How you validate the market potential for the newly launched products if there are not enough competitors?
[25.11.24, 13:14:59] ~ Christian: Good question
[25.11.24, 13:15:22] ~ Rustam: Got you, thanks brother! Shall I be collecting VAT?
[25.11.24, 13:16:19] ~ Rustam: Given I will use an llc from the US. Also does the domain extension matter, can I use .com, or preferably local domains?
[25.11.24, 13:18:02] ~ N: I seen a lot of German AI VSLs
[25.11.24, 13:21:14] ~ Growg: The best way to do is to reverse engineer the things- 

1. Co-relate the pain you are solving with other niche. See how they have successfully solved
Ex- If you are solving say Anti agrning cream so similar niche in Co-morbidity is solving to minimise the risk of it not get anti aging. 

Goal - Is to find and connect pain point you are solving is solved by other niche for you Avatar or not. 

2. Clearly define Avatar day to day routine and how your product will make theri pain solve/improve. Call at least 100 people and jot down what you got similarities. 

3. Start with $50-$100 after you have contacted the 100 people and had drawn specificity. 

Hope this helps.
[25.11.24, 13:24:33] ~ Wouter: Why don’t you scale harder
[25.11.24, 16:37:09] ~ Timotej: Guys - how aggressive are you scaling PMAX campaigns? 

Launched pre/BFCM campaign and its stable last 4 days … but never boosted pmax for more than 20% every few days … looking for ways to surf it maybe 😀
[25.11.24, 16:54:25] ~ Mert M: Hello anyone who knows a trademark expert? Would be nice if you could send it. We want to fill in a trademark

[25.11.24, 18:26:40] ~ Imran: Second, you can send them an email and ask them to lower it to 10%
[25.11.24, 18:27:30] ~ Imran: Tell them u have employees and supplier and vat..etc to pay , and this hold will prevent u from scaling effectively during this q4

[25.11.24, 20:23:58] ~ Klemen: Hi guys,

Hope your BFCM campaigns are crushing it and the scaling is going strong! 🚀

Quick question for those of you using the surfing method to scale budgets on Facebook:

🟢 By how much (%) are you increasing budgets at a time?
🟢 How often are you bumping up the budget throughout the day?
🟢 Do you lower the budget back to the starting amount at the end of the day?

Would love to hear how you’re running it this year and if it’s working for you!

Thanks in advance! 🙌
[25.11.24, 20:26:57] ~ Lucas Alves: we do just scale the ABO adsets which work, just surf the adests without dublicating
[25.11.24, 20:26:58] ~ Lucas Alves: it does not spend the whole Budget You increase to during the day
[25.11.24, 20:26:58] ~ Lucas Alves: if You want them to spend more just do 5x the budget
[25.11.24, 20:26:59] ~ Lucas Alves: and see if its still stable, if not, scale down to old budget
[25.11.24, 20:26:59] ~ Lucas Alves: Then restart to the original budget at the end of the day?
[25.11.24, 20:27:00] ~ Lucas Alves: yes lower it again, depends where You startet and ended. if the day was very good You can Keep it a bit higher than last day
[25.11.24, 20:27:17] ~ Lucas Alves: all the answers its from @⁨~Michael⁩

[26.11.24, 1:59:09] ~ Kyle Twohill: Hey guys I just got completely fucking scammed from this guy “scoreify” +19089709552 he stole 900$ from me never use his service.
[26.11.24, 2:13:58] ~ Kyle Twohill: He basically fakes like he is going to boost ur feedback score and charges ur card every week from his fake portal and won’t refund without your consent avoid this scum at all costs
[26.11.24, 2:17:13] ~ Charles: Unfortunate :(
[26.11.24, 2:17:42] ~ Nebil: Does anyone in here have any experience with liquidation? I have around 1,000 units of a magnesium supplement at my Nevada 3PL that I stopped selling. At this point I wouldn’t mind breaking even or taking a slight loss on it ‎<This message was edited>
[26.11.24, 2:44:22] ~ BG: Same thing happened to me, That man is a very evil man.

[26.11.24, 2:52:09] ~ Mert M: These scammers will go to hellfire
[26.11.24, 2:52:57] ~ Mert M: Crazy times. People losing their honour for small money
[26.11.24, 2:53:35] ~ Kyle Twohill: I did through PayPal and somehow lost, no clue how. Re disputed it though. He might have an insider or something lol
[26.11.24, 2:53:40] ~ Erne: Even worse. People losing their honour on internet. Is so easy getting exposed today. These people are so stupid
[26.11.24, 2:54:16] ~ Kyle Twohill: Yeah he’s using his real name too lol. What I don’t get is if he actually just did the service he would make good money
‎[26.11.24, 2:56:07] ~ BG: ‎image omitted
[26.11.24, 2:59:14] ~ Kyle Twohill: Yeah that’s exactly what he said to me he’s got a little answer for everything
[26.11.24, 5:58:41] ~ Vish: I had the same experience with them. I was a little suspicious for a week or two, but then it was almost a month and no updates. All I was assured is that they will update the proofs, but none give. Finally had to move on to another agency. They are far better. Had 0 problems after that.
[26.11.24, 5:59:15] ~ Vish: I would say stay away from Scoreify as much as possible
[26.11.24, 6:07:32] Topi: If anyone needs amazing feedback score, I have one good price, sends proof of everything they do, not a known provider. Got this lead from 9 figs / year business and so far amazing. Dm for intro
[26.11.24, 6:38:51] ~ Bazeed: whats the full formulation?
[26.11.24, 7:57:34] ~ Tom: Thanks for mentioning
[26.11.24, 10:02:36] ~ Matt: Yes but you will be lucky to get 30% of landed cost back if you can sell a supplement at all
[26.11.24, 11:01:31] ~ Samy: Anyone else having very bad performance today and yesterday? Haven’t added Black Friday banners maybe that is the reason.
[26.11.24, 11:07:55] ~ Rustam: one brand that I don’t have any mention of a sale or black friday sale is struggling for the past week. Was at 4.5 roas and $8k average days, and now to 4 roas and 3k days. The brand owner doesn’t want to run a sale, so I believe that this might be the case for you too.
[26.11.24, 11:08:19] ~ Rustam: Any store with an explicit mention of BF sale is seeing an uplift in CV and AOV
[26.11.24, 11:15:07] ~ Samy: Do you run Black Friday ads aswell? Or focus mainly on the website?
[26.11.24, 11:19:10] ~ Rustam: offer based static ads are crushing it. Just adding them to my evergreen ASC cost cap campaigns
[26.11.24, 11:19:30] ~ Rustam: If you can find a way to do a free gift with a best-seller, and with good margins, this kind of offer works really well too
[26.11.24, 11:21:23] ~ Samy: Alright, thanks!
[26.11.24, 11:25:45] ~ Rustam: Gl bro, launch even some ugly looking ads with a BF headline, and your sales will be back
[26.11.24, 11:30:08] ~ Ry: Do u run specific days sales (like BF/Christmas) in ur usual ASC or run them in separate campaigns?
[26.11.24, 11:42:08] ~ Rustam: If I have cost caps on, then I run in the main scaling campaign. Cost caps prevent them from overspending if they don’t perform
[26.11.24, 14:29:48] ~ Mert M: hello anyone here exited his brand / store before and who I can ask questions in dm? Thanks in advance
[26.11.24, 14:35:15] ~ Wouter: Yes
[26.11.24, 14:36:39] ~ Mert M: thanks bro
[26.11.24, 14:51:59] ~ Ry: Yes i did. I have alot of tips and what to be careful.
[26.11.24, 15:52:10] ~ Zsombor: Who do you guys pay for getting good quality UGC videos made?
[26.11.24, 15:52:18] ~ Zsombor: Anyone has a good contact?
[26.11.24, 15:59:11] ~ Gideon: I work with an agency who makes 30 creatives for me per month. They do everything but you still can decide if scripts and creator is what you want.
[26.11.24, 16:00:00] ~ Ben Mansour: How do you find their creatives so far?
[26.11.24, 16:01:50] ~ Gideon: I must say. Quality is very good. And the guys are also good. They think with you and really want the best for you! Monthly call about the results
[26.11.24, 16:02:08] ~ Jonathan Bach: Whats pricing like?
[26.11.24, 16:02:21] ~ Jonathan Bach: And is that all video / ugc style content?
[26.11.24, 16:04:23] ~ Ben Mansour: Can you please share the contact
[26.11.24, 16:11:05] ~ Gideon: Its around 2800 per month. Its all UGC style. They test different concepts. Look at Thumbstop and hookrate
[26.11.24, 16:11:58] ~ Gideon: You can send me a dm so I can share the contact

[26.11.24, 16:22:02] ~ Nal: Interested in this also
[26.11.24, 16:42:41] ~ Facundo: same happened to me with scoreify, he stopped replying, then i messaged him from another phone number asking for info about his service and he instantly replied…
[26.11.24, 16:44:27] ~ Jonny: Yes

[26.11.24, 19:23:53] ~ Nick Jansen: Yes last days are really bad here
[26.11.24, 19:26:50] ~ Samy: Have you launched black friday ads or added black friday badges/banners to your store?
[26.11.24, 19:28:14] ~ Timotej: We replaced 80% of our acquisition campaigns with BFCM campaigns and every single audience we could think of and CVR is back … launch BFCM asap 😀
[26.11.24, 19:28:35] ~ Nick Jansen: Yes, we did. We launched an additional Black Friday CBO, and everything was running smoothly until a few days ago, we had to downscale slightly today .
[26.11.24, 19:29:06] ~ Nick Jansen: CBO or Asc + ?
[26.11.24, 19:30:12] ~ Timotej: Everything- Asc/ABO/CBO - static images and videos
[26.11.24, 19:30:25] ~ Samy: Did you do any Changes to your website aswell? Like adding timers, badges, discounts.
[26.11.24, 19:33:03] ~ Timotej: For now only top-header announcing BFCM, driving to caregory page dedicatet for BFCM … and each product got BFCM ribbon communicatin the offer ….

And we are sending out mailings almost daily, since 14th  Dec
[26.11.24, 19:35:03] ~ Samy: Have you discounted a lot aswell or almost keeping the same prices.
[26.11.24, 19:36:48] ~ Timotej: We mainly focus on bundles … buy two get one free … and then we gave different bundle combos … single product - hero - is also discouted but we are not pushing it too much … more bundles to boost AOV
[26.11.24, 19:37:28] ~ Samy: Got it, thanks!
[27.11.24, 0:43:16] ~ Nal: If anyone here is interested in getting their store sold. Drop me a DM.

[27.11.24, 7:21:06] ~ Rustam: Did anyone have experience with a main page and a backup page taken down out of the blue? Competitor has been stealing shit from us like almost immediately after we make it live, and now I think they got a way to disable our pages. Any workaround to this?
[27.11.24, 8:59:07] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Hey guys, good to connect. After making quite some M’s in general fashion, I want to switch part of my focus to branded dropshipping. And working more on the long vision. 

Does anyone has an good (legit) guy that’s offers 1:1 to get the insights? Somebody that is doing real numbers and really know what he is taking about. No big mass coaching! 
Thanks!🙏🤩
[27.11.24, 9:08:39] ~ Matt: But this won’t give you the 3 x points like a us entity gets?

[27.11.24, 9:58:15] ~ Aaron Ware: What did you sell? What was the multiple? How was your business valuated?
[27.11.24, 10:35:58] ~ RS: Anybody has Airwallex reps? They closed my payments account just after 5 days
[27.11.24, 10:39:08] ~ Reus: Yeah Dm me I will connect you
[27.11.24, 10:53:06] ~ Mert M: They are demons also
[27.11.24, 11:01:42] ~ Alex: Do you guys have experience switching ad accounts from time to time because the current ad account is no longer performing well? or do you always stay with the same add account?
[27.11.24, 11:03:14] ~ Aaron Ware: I literally just did this and it works. I scaled to 70k / day and then ads got rejected ever since then anything new I tried would never work. 

Swapped out to a new ad account fixed right away.
[27.11.24, 11:03:44] ~ Nick Jansen: New account and link your pixel with it?
[27.11.24, 11:03:50] ~ Robert: Is it possible to run google ads without having to take a pic of my business? Im across the world and they want one. Anyone know a workaround?
[27.11.24, 11:09:25] ~ Alex: Yes so same pixel but new add acoount
[27.11.24, 11:09:35] ~ Alex: Sounds good!
[27.11.24, 11:15:15] ~ Eugen: has anyone had the experience that their personal profile on facebook no longer works for advertising. i have tried several things, new ad account, new pixel, new BM. always the same bad results. competitors steal our ads and let them run for months and they don't perform for us, maybe you have a tip. so i think maybe it's because of my private profile.
[27.11.24, 11:15:33] ~ Ry: Yes i have
[27.11.24, 11:17:37] ~ Tom: Anyone can recommed a good fb agency accounts w invoice/post-paid payment?

[27.11.24, 11:37:22] Topi: with cashback
[27.11.24, 11:38:21] ~ Dr Zied: I can connect to an agency No httpool ( direct contact with meta), you can insert your card( no top up), only commission ( no monthly fees)
[27.11.24, 11:39:02] ~ Eugen: with which profile do you advertise than. do you use something like this: https://exiscale.com/
[27.11.24, 11:44:35] ~ Alex: Which the ones the agency gives me. Mostly chinese personal profiles
[27.11.24, 11:46:06] ~ Alex: At the moment I'm at easy scale. But looking around maybe there are better agencies around here
[27.11.24, 11:50:26] ~ Marcos García: Hey Guys, anyone know somebody who can help us to get back one store that have been banned because DMCA without previous contact

[27.11.24, 14:00:16] ~ Num: Guys who work wit advertorials can you advise which work better for you gempages or Funnelysh?
[27.11.24, 14:06:48] Topi: you can build nice advertorials with both super fast
[27.11.24, 14:07:18] Topi: it comes down if you want more store experience or funnel. For store, use shopify, customized funnel, funnelish
[27.11.24, 14:07:46] Topi: In my experience, the “funnels” don’t work so well europe but do well in US
[27.11.24, 14:07:53] Topi: Funnelish also unlimited upsells
[27.11.24, 14:18:15] ~ Omar: Which ad account company did u go with
[27.11.24, 14:27:02] ~ Vish: Funnelish work well in NA in general.

[27.11.24, 18:14:22] ~ Maksym: what’s good everyone, just joined. 

my name is Maksym, I’m based in Cleveland, OH— originally from Ternopil, Ukraine

my partner @⁨~Nikita⁩⁩ and I ran fashion for the past year started on TT, ended up running only FB. scaled to 6 figure months until we ran into problems with suppliers, currently scaled down & figuring that out. looking forward to connecting with everyone in here. Although I’m sure most people in here have more xp I’ll try my best to provide as much value as I can as we continue learning, scaling, and testing more things.
[27.11.24, 19:49:07] ~ Nikita: Hey bro, sent a DM
[27.11.24, 23:43:46] ~ Steve: https://x.com/jchdotme/status/1861875798472540421?t=tERrua9VGTkMWQesUxm-DA&s=19
[27.11.24, 23:44:02] ~ Steve: There were a lot of people in this group worried about this, and this is most detail of seen on it
[27.11.24, 23:44:31] ~ Steve: I know this guy and he's scaled many health supps offers so I trust him. Interesting insights
[27.11.24, 23:47:28] ~ Davide: we hope for that: “Companies with supplements / topicals / f&b / devices which target things like anti-aging, better skin, energy, focus will be unaffected.*”
[27.11.24, 23:47:42] ~ Steve: Well see
[28.11.24, 1:09:59] ~ Aaron Ware: For the OG veterans I’m going to AW for the first time, what things should I bring if anything?
[28.11.24, 3:45:54] ~ Parker Godfrey: Anyone have insight of what countries outside of the US you would recommend for a fashion brand?
[28.11.24, 4:04:48] ~ Maksym: never had consistent results ww fashion, but Ceo Alix on twitter talks about how he tests his WW campaigns
[28.11.24, 4:05:22] ~ Parker Godfrey: Thanks man I’ll check him out. If anyone else has suggestions that would be helpful!
[28.11.24, 4:25:11] ~ Lucas Alves: is anyone here running at LATAM?
[28.11.24, 6:54:04] ~ Asch: Anyone here in shapewear clothing niche?
[28.11.24, 7:30:46] ~ harshil Thummar: Let me know the best black friday offer we can put
[28.11.24, 8:07:57] ~ Twizzylit: Bro you’re a little late to figure out a BF offer
[28.11.24, 8:09:33] ~ harshil Thummar: Yeah brother
[28.11.24, 8:09:40] ~ harshil Thummar: Currently running also
[28.11.24, 8:09:53] ~ harshil Thummar: But for better insight or additional anyone can share
[28.11.24, 9:41:31] ~ Bazeed: guys im launching a facebook VSL after a long time, only used to do native, any suggestions on what would work best as per the landing page for the VSL? its a 20min long vsl, would straight VSL to product page do good, or will having a listicle / presell before the main pdp be better?
[28.11.24, 9:43:05] ~ Bazeed: currently i was planning to do infeed VSL > sales offer page > checkout
[28.11.24, 9:43:23] ~ Bazeed: would appreciate any feedback from anyone whos runnign VSLs currently
[28.11.24, 9:43:45] Topi: Hey bro @⁨~Bazeed⁩
[28.11.24, 9:43:48] Topi: Thats how we do it
[28.11.24, 9:43:53] Topi: Around 2m month
[28.11.24, 9:44:00] Topi: With that setup
[28.11.24, 9:44:35] Topi: Recently started testing advertorials for higher ticket items and it works smooth, aov for this around 190
[28.11.24, 9:44:43] ~ Bazeed: hey man, you mean straight to pdp from vsl
[28.11.24, 9:44:48] ~ Bazeed: can u pls elaborate the funnel
[28.11.24, 9:45:06] Topi: Infeed vsl 3-10 mins
Shopify pdp
Cart
Checkout

This setup we use for aov 50
[28.11.24, 9:45:33] Topi: Infeed vsl 3-10mins
Advertorial
Sales page
Checkout (offer is here)

This for higher ticket
[28.11.24, 9:45:40] ~ Bazeed: Interesting and i suppose the pdp is mix of direct response type page?
[28.11.24, 9:45:58] ~ Maksym: so this outperformed straight to pdp
[28.11.24, 9:46:03] Topi: Yeah it looks like shopify pdp but very conversion optimized and uses lots of dr principles
[28.11.24, 9:46:15] Topi: For offer start price 150 yes
[28.11.24, 9:46:32] Topi: Also for lower ticket but difference so low we dont bother do advs for that
[28.11.24, 9:46:45] ~ Maksym: ah starting 150 makes sense
[28.11.24, 9:46:56] ~ Maksym: thank you will take note of that
[28.11.24, 9:47:16] ~ Bazeed: got it man, i fall under the 50$ aov but its in a different market-so i might have to test both
[28.11.24, 9:47:59] Topi: Yeaa imho under 50 if vsl is good enough will not need adv but feel free to test
[28.11.24, 9:48:08] Topi: At least should start converting just with pdp
[28.11.24, 9:48:26] ~ Bazeed: great thanks for the insights bro
[28.11.24, 9:50:33] ~ Ben Mansour: To start keep things as simple as possible
[28.11.24, 9:50:45] ~ Ben Mansour: Vsl to shopify pdp
[28.11.24, 9:50:53] ~ Ben Mansour: Work on CRO and AOV
[28.11.24, 9:51:18] ~ Ben Mansour: then you can start using advertorials that after drive to that pdp ‎<This message was edited>
[28.11.24, 9:51:22] ~ Ben Mansour: Use gempages for that
[28.11.24, 9:51:31] ~ Bazeed: got it got it, i had this offer page in mind instead of PDP but they gotta scroll all the way down for the offer, so might just go with pdp now
[28.11.24, 9:53:17] Topi: 100% agree with this, biggest enemy for us time to time is just over complicating things
[28.11.24, 9:54:08] ~ Ben Mansour: True, just start, scale and optimize along the way
[28.11.24, 9:54:41] ~ Bazeed: also do you guys normally use the theme to customize the pdp or theres an app?
[28.11.24, 9:54:54] ~ Bazeed: to add some DR copy, etc
[28.11.24, 9:55:23] Topi: Always gempages
[28.11.24, 9:55:47] ~ Bazeed: interesting thats better than pagefly?
[28.11.24, 9:55:57] Topi: I dont think any difference
[28.11.24, 9:56:12] Topi: Just once started with gempages and sticked with it
[28.11.24, 9:57:12] ~ Bazeed: got it bro, i think gempages has inbuilt upsells which is good
[28.11.24, 13:15:31] ~ Samy: I would say Germany and Netherlands are biggest in fashion in Europe.
[28.11.24, 13:23:25] ~ Viktor Zemann: Let me know if you need help 👍
[28.11.24, 13:36:51] ~ NeuroCup: for new products, how are testing creatives? open interest?
[28.11.24, 14:11:11] ~ Omar: Has anyone seen average watch time Vs cpm 

Have an affect 

So the higher the average watch time the lower the CPM?
[28.11.24, 14:12:28] Topi: yes absolutely
[28.11.24, 14:12:43] Topi: With VSLs I can see from the avg play time are we about to scale this ad or no
[28.11.24, 14:14:05] ~ Omar: What would you say a good average watch time is?
[28.11.24, 14:15:21] Topi: Depends on your video length but for me with 3-4 minute video
[28.11.24, 14:15:41] Topi: 7-8 seconds = this video is gonna be slighlty profitable
[28.11.24, 14:15:50] Topi: +10 = gonna scale
[28.11.24, 14:16:02] Topi: Close 20 = new monster campaign
[28.11.24, 14:16:40] Topi: With time you will learn your own KPIs as time goes
[28.11.24, 14:17:33] ~ Omar: Makes sense I guess that’s why video pacing is so important
[28.11.24, 14:17:45] ~ Omar: Making sure you change clips fast every few words
[28.11.24, 14:18:02] Topi: 90% of the success of your video is copywriting
[28.11.24, 14:18:13] Topi: Just make sure you don’t have stock footage in your hook / lead and youre good
[28.11.24, 14:18:32] ~ Omar: You think? If you put clips for a big subtitle you don’t see a problem?
[28.11.24, 14:18:42] Topi: Some of our best videos are extremely ugly and slow and they skill average almost 20s average play. It’s all about research and copywriting
[28.11.24, 14:18:43] ~ Omar: Yeah this is probably key coz ppl sick and tired of seeing that shit
[28.11.24, 14:19:16] Topi: Tell your audience something they’ve never seen before, don’t be afraid to be controversial
[28.11.24, 14:19:33] ~ Ben Mansour: What kind of clips can we use in hook then?
[28.11.24, 14:20:05] Topi: If 90% of VSLs you see running start “The real root cause of your neck pain is pinned nerve” and you try to go with that, we see very poor results. You want to research and write something original. Once you crack that it hits like crazy
[28.11.24, 14:20:09] Topi: UGC
[28.11.24, 14:20:57] ~ Tom: Most of the time the controversial is what gets viral a lot. 

People discuss in comments, share to their friends etc.
[28.11.24, 14:21:15] ~ Bazeed: interesting
[28.11.24, 14:21:41] ~ Bazeed: could you give an example? most people would say to have some sort of weird/ attention grabbing 3 second scroll stopper
[28.11.24, 14:21:49] ~ Bazeed: what do you use for the hook
[28.11.24, 14:21:49] ~ Omar: What about like a Persoanl story)

I was 48 years old when I first experienced back pain
[28.11.24, 14:22:23] ~ Omar: For your store in IND u can run what ever coz competition is low
[28.11.24, 14:22:58] ~ Omar: I saw you do COD
[28.11.24, 14:23:01] ~ Bazeed: ye no ones doing it here
[28.11.24, 14:24:34] Topi: Well if you just look ads in your niche that are scaling you find patterns. But to be honest around 40-60 hook rate is very easy to achieve, just pick a clip where is some movement and red color always works well for us. Thats not the “hard” part. The hard part is to achieve hold rate. Thats where your copywriting kicks in
[28.11.24, 14:25:19] ~ Bazeed: @⁨Topi⁩ if you see signs of the vsl being profitable, but its not doing that good at start, how would you go about optimising it? or what would you change from then
[28.11.24, 14:25:27] ~ Omar: You see for you guys who run VSLs

Are there few other guys running the same product with VSLs in ur marketplace
[28.11.24, 14:26:08] ~ Bazeed: yep lets see i just launched the vsl, copy is on point. btw gem pages is insane way better than pagefly🚀
[28.11.24, 14:27:14] Topi: High cvr low avg play time = try new leads keep mechanism same

High playtime low cvr = fix your mechanism and add more social proof  etc
[28.11.24, 14:27:44] ~ Omar: Faster than Funnelish? ‎<This message was edited>
[28.11.24, 14:28:09] ~ Bazeed: nope but everything stays within shopify so u dont need diff processor + tracking gets also easier
[28.11.24, 14:28:20] ~ Bazeed: funnelish u always need a new setup
[28.11.24, 14:28:26] ~ Bazeed: perfect thats gems bro
[28.11.24, 16:51:33] ~ Arad Khazabi: Been dealing with immediate restrictions with fb ad accounts for the past few months

Launching 1 campaign with 1 ad set and a few ads works fine

As soon as I increase the number of ads - boom, immediately restricted.

Anybody dealing with this problem aswell? What do you guys advise?

Any people you know that sell strong BMs with ad accs. Thanks!

(Already over 30 ad accs restricted due to that) ‎<This message was edited>
[28.11.24, 16:52:57] ~ N: Switch to agency ad account
[28.11.24, 16:53:42] ~ Arad Khazabi: Which ones do you prefer? Used mediaglobe - happens the same thing.

Also tried "Malu", which was way too expensive (500€ a month with 4.5% from ad spend)
[28.11.24, 16:53:54] ~ N: No way?
[28.11.24, 16:53:57] ~ N: What type of ads u running
[28.11.24, 16:54:17] ~ Arad Khazabi: You use mediaglobe?

[28.11.24, 16:55:01] ~ N: Makes no sense are u in the foot niche
[28.11.24, 16:55:01] ~ Arad Khazabi: I’m aware of the stuff such as to much skin showing, health products, to big claims, and all that stuff

[28.11.24, 16:55:36] ~ Arad Khazabi: Mostly in the pet / travel niche

[28.11.24, 16:56:28] ~ Ben Mansour: Sure
[28.11.24, 16:56:37] ~ Arad Khazabi: So there is only a monthly fee?

[28.11.24, 16:56:59] ~ Arad Khazabi: Huh? What’s the catch?
[28.11.24, 16:57:01] ~ Ben Mansour: They pay you cashback hahah
[28.11.24, 16:57:12] ~ Ben Mansour: Official Facebook partners
[28.11.24, 16:57:20] ~ Arad Khazabi: Hmm interesting
[28.11.24, 16:57:20] ~ Ben Mansour: They get cashback from fb

[28.11.24, 21:01:55] ~ N: This is before ur ad goes live
[28.11.24, 21:02:00] ~ N: So u can get ur link
[28.11.24, 21:02:05] ~ N: Better to launch ad with some comments
[28.11.24, 21:02:24] ~ Maksym: okay interesting never heard of that
[28.11.24, 21:02:34] ~ N: Yhh try it out
[28.11.24, 21:03:30] ~ Maksym: will do bro, this make a dif for ya?
[28.11.24, 21:04:10] ~ N: Try it if u was a customer what ad would u trust the one with commenrs saying they got order or the ad with 0 comments
[28.11.24, 21:05:03] ~ Maksym: yeah ofc bro it makes sense, just seen so many tricks like this so have to be wary of what we actually implement you know
[28.11.24, 21:08:32] ~ Bazeed: fair enough, i. still have the link after its live tho
[28.11.24, 21:08:59] ~ Bazeed: sort of i had an ad hit 5mil views in a month i boosted it before jt launched
[28.11.24, 21:09:12] ~ Bazeed: not saying it was all cause of smm but that might have given it a boost at start
[28.11.24, 21:09:21] ~ Arad Khazabi: does this actually make such a big difference or just waste of time *when testing a product?*
[28.11.24, 21:10:02] ~ Bazeed: not whike testing a product, if u have a winner or if its a vsl and you pretty much.know its gonna perform then u just boost it up

[29.11.24, 3:14:00] ~ Joshua: Currently what I am doing as well
[29.11.24, 3:14:15] ~ Nebil: I heard of an insider service that bans fb ad accounts, Shopify stores, stripe/shopify payments,  google merchant centers and any possible advertising platform. Basically a bunch of insiders got together for anyone who’s dealing with people ripping their content. I heard it’s like 2.5k a month ‎<This message was edited>
[29.11.24, 3:15:04] ~ Maksym: Buddy had a rep as well, apparently a massive competitor brand was paying insiders crazy money to get competitors accs banned
[29.11.24, 3:15:24] ~ Joshua: I figured this exists
[29.11.24, 3:17:22] ~ Nebil: Yeah bro they make it impossible to run if you rip
[29.11.24, 3:18:02] ~ Nebil: I’ve been looking for an Amazon insider, it’s been one of the most painful since Chinese suppliers undercut the hell out of you ‎<This message was edited>
[29.11.24, 3:51:09] ~ Al: we do the same
[29.11.24, 3:51:26] ~ Al: pixsy is a good app to constantly reverse image search your images so you can find people stealing your shit

[29.11.24, 5:26:28] ~ Aaron Ware: Yeah I doubled X2
[29.11.24, 5:36:30] ~ Henry: Hey guys would it be wise to launch brand new creatives on Black Friday? Since most of the $$ will come from the already winning ads, should you still test new creatives tonight or wait until BFCM is done?
[29.11.24, 5:44:42] ~ Bazeed: guys just launched some new vsls. they are doing good, in terms of doubling adspend, is it wise to double at once or should i increase  20% at a time(i remember the learning phase would come up and ad performance would go down)
[29.11.24, 5:47:31] ~ Mikael: Which volume app are you guys using with Gempages that works good? (I have issues with Kaching, Vitals and Wide bundles..)
[29.11.24, 6:02:15] ~ Bazeed: you just need the bundles for aov?
[29.11.24, 6:02:34] ~ Mikael: Yeah bro, and also to choose varaint (2 different)
[29.11.24, 6:02:41] ~ Bazeed: im using the inbuilt shopify variants for now, works great for me its very simple
[29.11.24, 6:03:25] ~ Bazeed: you might wanna try out the shopify bundles using variants and options makes it simple
[29.11.24, 6:04:08] ~ Mikael: Okey so this is a good option instead of using the apps? and works good? do you have different variants aswell?
[29.11.24, 6:33:21] ~ Bazeed: no i dont have variants, but pretty sure u can add them ad well

[29.11.24, 22:36:05] ~ Growg: Strategic mix of email, Ads and CRO stuff
[29.11.24, 22:43:28] ~ YUSUF: Hey guys, I’ve been dealing with economic nexus across multiple states. We need to register and file sales tax in over 10 states, but the firms I’ve looked into so far are crazy expensive.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Do you have any recommendations for firms, tools, or a more affordable way to handle it? Also, have any of you used the SST program?
[29.11.24, 22:44:50] ~ Parker Godfrey: I use TaxRex for filing. It’s wildly cheap. Like $20 per state. But you need to register per state yourself and submit the state payments yourself too.

They will do all the calculations for you so you know how much you owe. ‎<This message was edited>
[29.11.24, 23:27:22] ~ Ben Mansour: Can you drop some CRO sauce bro, having that cvr with such an AOV is crazy!
[29.11.24, 23:30:16] ~ M: Agreed
[29.11.24, 23:38:08] ~ Charles: agency for CRO?
[29.11.24, 23:38:15] ~ Charles: Or all by yourself?
[29.11.24, 23:38:20] ~ Growg: sure things @⁨~Ben Mansour⁩ , @⁨~M⁩ . Let this end and will share some cool stuff bro

[30.11.24, 9:23:30] ~ Nick Jansen: On average 3-5% only. 

P&L show lots of moments with 15-25% profit days but after 2-3 weeks ad account crash of roas started to drop. And we have to start over. 

I can hit those 10-20% profit margins but can sustain them due to lack of time or skills 🤷🏻‍♂️
[30.11.24, 9:24:00] ~ Robert: So it's dropshipping? Not branded stock?
[30.11.24, 9:26:07] ~ A: How much profit Nov 2024
[30.11.24, 9:26:22] ~ Nick Jansen: We started with dropshipping but got a custom design from our supplier. So we launched our new improved products in oktober. 

Plan was to finish branding after a decent start in q4 but it’s difficult now 😂
[30.11.24, 9:26:42] ~ Robert: Now is the easiest time of the year!
[30.11.24, 9:27:05] ~ Nick Jansen: We where heading to 10k profit this month.
But 6 days ago cpm and Cpc went sky rocket and we started to make small losses again
[30.11.24, 9:27:23] ~ Nick Jansen: That the main reason starting to doubt again
[30.11.24, 9:27:27] ~ Robert: Would you still sell it if you figured out how to advertise properly?
[30.11.24, 9:27:48] ~ Nick Jansen: Nowp no chance 😂

[30.11.24, 9:28:29] ~ A: What is your markup
[30.11.24, 9:28:51] ~ Nick Jansen: Yeah I know but I run a construction company 12 hours a day so. I need to pick a side. But cash need to come in everyday 😂
[30.11.24, 9:29:19] ~ Robert: I know that grind, I did the same construction 12 hr grind. I feel you.

[30.11.24, 9:36:26] ~ Mert M: Hello, did some of you didnt get payout of shopify yesterday?
From 1 store i didnt get it. And heard other people also talking about it
[30.11.24, 9:38:07] ~ Nick Jansen: We sell for 59$ and cost of good with shipping is 21,5$ so markup is about 174% if im correct? :P
[30.11.24, 10:05:52] ~ A: Increase your price, your markup is too low
[30.11.24, 10:07:57] ~ Nick Jansen: whats a good mark up for you?
[30.11.24, 10:12:29] ~ A: For your product I would sell on the $100 range
[30.11.24, 10:12:35] ~ A: Otherwise not scalable

[30.11.24, 20:55:18] ~ Charles: But I think Loop and recharge are the best for larger scale even tho they are more pricey

[1.12.24, 3:19:37] ~ Erne: Hey guys, in the last 2 days I received 2 DMCAs from stores that have literally copied 1:1 my product page.

In total, I have about 7/8 copycat of my store, literally everything, from the copy, to the images to the page structure etc. What’s the best way to take them down without DMCA? I want to avoid DMCA because they could send them back to me and I would like to avoid a DMCA war, especially because Shopify have a broken system for DMCA, and they accept everything lol.

Also, is that true that if I receive 3 DMCA, Shopify is gonna take my store down without the possibility to recover it back ?
[1.12.24, 3:25:00] ~ Aman: Yes but if you counter every DMCA that comes in it doesn't count
[1.12.24, 3:28:21] ~ Erne: But even if I do counter them my page still is down for some time. That’s the main problem, especially now in this sales period
[1.12.24, 3:29:02] ~ Aman: Ah I see, just create a back up product page and run on a new one
[1.12.24, 3:29:11] ~ Aman: That's what I did a while ago and nothing happened
[1.12.24, 3:29:23] ~ Erne: And redirect the ads link to the new URL?
[1.12.24, 3:29:27] ~ Aman: You should always have a back up of the theme and the product
[1.12.24, 3:29:29] ~ Aman: Yup

[1.12.24, 3:57:31] ~ Mason Schulze: Don't understand why facebook fucks you up when you give it more money to spend
[1.12.24, 4:13:58] ~ Igor: For subscriptions I can recommend to stick to Shopify Payments as per my experience. They have free app(Shopify Subscriptions) and ready integration. Easy native contract management. 

The thing is 3rd party subscription providers do not render subscription elements in checkout ( at least per my experience with Cybersource) and these elements like recurring total, recurring shipping and deffered payment notice are legally required to be present in Checkout here in EU(Austria). 

Check if your subscription provider render these elements in checkout and if this is legal requirement in the country you operate.

Upd: I see that seal natively integrates with Shopify contracts and checkout looks good👍 ‎<This message was edited>
[1.12.24, 4:16:27] ~ Igor: Guyz, anyone know AI tool that clone theme from another Shopify store(not mine)? 

I saw some ad while ago, but can’t remember it. Googled with no luck, only found tools that copies products, not the theme/design.

[1.12.24, 4:21:11] ~ Ilda: Just how good ur funnel
Is
[1.12.24, 4:21:28] ~ Ilda: Just bc u do good at let’s say 1k a day spend doesn’t mean it’ll do good at 10k day
[1.12.24, 8:34:54] ~ harshil Thummar: Give me scaling suggestions,
1 campaign with 500 usd targeting us,uk,Canada,aus, giving consider results how to scale it and also should I target individual country per ad set?
[1.12.24, 11:16:54] ~ Matt: You can use html to figma to copy any design of any website but still need to get dev to build it
[1.12.24, 11:16:58] ~ Matt: It’s a Figma app
[1.12.24, 11:22:50] ~ Alex Lever: I only scale the ASC and put all the countries in there. I have a CBO prospecting campaign to do all the testing. The CBO is usually around 10%-20% max of daily spend
[1.12.24, 11:23:46] ~ Alex Lever: Ideally you want to build up your ASC like a team. So you have BOF and TOF offers all in the same campaign
[1.12.24, 11:23:51] ~ Igor: Yeah, already found couple plugins for html to design and design to Shopify theme. Thanks!
[1.12.24, 11:33:40] ~ ECOM BULLS: my team can do that lmk if you need help
[1.12.24, 11:53:19] ~ Ry: Hey guys, do u target one country per ASC campaign or lump all the countries u targeting in one campaign?
[1.12.24, 12:04:39] ~ Arad Khazabi: hey guys something that i questioned myself always:

let say you get a dmca

you have 1 backup product page besides you're main product page

obviously since both are 2 *different product pages*, it cannot have the same URL

so when the main product page gets dmcad, how do you change the redirect link / URL to the backup product page so the traffic comes to the right page?

might be a dumb question. but I seriously always questioned myself how people do that.
[1.12.24, 12:49:23] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Search on fiverr, you can find some good resources in reasonable budget who offer full shopify website & funnel clothing services.
[1.12.24, 13:22:38] ~ harshil Thummar: Thanks bro
[1.12.24, 14:25:35] ~ Daniel: hey man I have a guy who helps me with that, he’s an intellectual property lawyer and he takes them down by messaging the hosting provider, contacts in Shopify, facebook & Google DMCA etc

He charges around $50/hour but he delivers, if you want I can share the contact
[1.12.24, 14:26:00] ~ Ry: Please share with me as well
[1.12.24, 14:29:20] ~ Igor: You can setup redirects inside Shopify. But you can redirect the product page only if it is on draft and not active. But if it is removed from Shopify just change the handle in your new product
[1.12.24, 15:20:48] ~ Kristian Drabek: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added Kristian Drabek
[1.12.24, 16:57:41] ~ Mert M: no it will f up the performance. If this happens what you need to do is. 

Duplicate product & page.
Go to navigation.
Old url > new url

So everyone who goes on your dmca'd url will go to your new copied one. And costumers still can order
[1.12.24, 16:58:09] ~ Mert M: When youre scaling. every second counts

[1.12.24, 19:23:35] ~ Christopher Murphy: For anyone in the supplement space running advertorials:

Do they work? Or should you just send traffic to a long form sales page?
[1.12.24, 19:23:45] ~ Christopher Murphy: I talked to a copywriting agency owner who’s written 100s of advertorials. He said for supplements, long form sales pages work a lot better than advertorials and that we’re wasting our time creating them. 

He said listicles work better as well, but not as good as long form sales page.

We’re currently sending Facebook traffic to advertorials and results haven’t been amazing….  Just want to see if there’s anyone who’s seeing this as well to justify the pivot away from advertorials.
[1.12.24, 19:23:53] ~ Steve: Advertorials work for supplements. All types
[1.12.24, 19:24:05] ~ Steve: Pre sale pages to On page VSLs if you can crack that it's pretty goated
[1.12.24, 19:24:18] ~ Steve: Long form advertorials work, they're killer when done right
[1.12.24, 19:24:57] ~ Steve: Hybrid sales pages also work as well but those are really just an advertorial combined with a sales page, tend to do very well for warm traffic on launches
[1.12.24, 19:25:28] ~ Growg: Advertorial is go-to for Supplements, Works really good. 
Supplement works on Authenticity. 2 ways either through known face or through written form.
[1.12.24, 19:26:03] ~ Christopher Murphy: Thanks guys! Do you know of any good advertorial examples in the supplement space I could take a look at?
[1.12.24, 19:26:15] ~ Steve: All comes down to offer and copy. If your advertorial and your offer sucks then no funnel structure is gonna save you
[1.12.24, 19:26:43] ~ Steve: Most people I come across are pretty lost when it comes to advertorials. They try a few, don't dial them in, don't know how/why they work and then give up and say advertorials don't work for us
[1.12.24, 19:26:55] ~ Steve: Which is great for the rest of us who continue to scale with them lol
[1.12.24, 19:28:53] ~ Christopher Murphy: How do you know when an advertorial is worth refining and building off of after launching it? Do you just look at CTR and CVR?
[1.12.24, 19:29:02] ~ Bazeed: activation has some great supplement funnels

[1.12.24, 19:59:42] ~ M: so we havent tried vsls yet, and i was looking into it from the mega file sent on here and came across this:https://swissklip.com/nanotoothbrush-fb-ecommvsl-v1/
[1.12.24, 20:00:23] ~ M: and im just wondering would that ACTUALLY work/anyone tried it? to me it looks a little “scammy” but open to hear other peoples experiences of what they would do differently to that vsl
[1.12.24, 20:05:51] ~ Bazeed: not scammy at all infact these advertorials/ vsls increase ur aov if theyre made right
[1.12.24, 20:05:57] ~ Bazeed: thats how every brand on native does it

[1.12.24, 23:44:02] ~ Vish: You need to go mids, Stripe would easily die if you scale too fast and too hard

[2.12.24, 0:41:00] ~ N: Quick way to get 10 new ad scripts and find your next winning ad that scales with AI 

#1. Take your winning ad script and upload it to claude.

"Here is my winning ad script. Please take a second to analyze and familiarize yourself with the product. Once you're done, let me know."

#2. Tell claude to analyze your last 10 losing ad scripts.

"Now here is the last 10 scripts we've tested that have all lost and did not make us money. Please take a second to analyze them."

#3. Ask claude to help you on new angles based off this data.

"Now that you've gotten to analyze both winning and losing, please give me a list of things i'm not touching on that could improve performance OR a list of angles that I have not tried yet that would likely be a winner"

#4. Ask claude to write you a hook for each

"Please write me a hook for each one, i could then turn into an ad"

#5. Write an ad script for each

"Please write me an ad script for each"

#6. Double space & add b-roll

"Please double space each sentence and add b-roll for each sentence"

#7. Copy to a google doc

#8. Send to top performing content creator you use

#9. Launch new video content

[2.12.24, 5:35:35] ~ Mason Schulze: Trying to expand my brand into that market, health wellness niche
[2.12.24, 5:44:31] ~ NeuroCup: are you already running? brazil import taxes are fucked, so international drop isn’t always a good idea
[2.12.24, 6:19:58] ~ Mason Schulze: Testing atm, but very low conversion rate. Not sure what people in Brazil are expecting to see as payment options typically
[2.12.24, 6:57:15] ~ Mikael: Have anyone had all of their "Listicle" Ads been rejected? We just had this and I´m confused. Did Meta apply some updates to their policys and dont accept "Top 4 Product" Listicles?

[2.12.24, 10:38:51] ~ Tom: Val’s are much more effective than tsl‘s. 

People prefer watching a video more than reading. Especially if the video contains a lot of dopamine and the script is good. 

I would say depends on the product, you don’t need a sales page for a viral drop shipping product that wouldn’t be it. It would definitely be worth it if you are selling a digital product.
[2.12.24, 10:52:54] ~ Mert M: yt
[2.12.24, 11:26:56] ~ Daniel: takes the page down

[2.12.24, 13:21:22] ~ NeuroCup: what’s your ticket?
[2.12.24, 13:22:14] ~ NeuroCup: in brazil anything above u$50 you’re getting taxed at 92%
[2.12.24, 13:22:36] ~ Bazeed: wtf
[2.12.24, 13:22:36] ~ Bazeed: 92?
[2.12.24, 13:25:08] ~ Mason Schulze: Who's getting taxed that amount
[2.12.24, 13:25:35] ~ NeuroCup: yup
[2.12.24, 13:25:52] ~ NeuroCup: and below $50 is 40%
[2.12.24, 13:26:17] ~ NeuroCup: if following the law, everybody
[2.12.24, 13:27:32] ~ NeuroCup: you could declare the item as something cheaper/lower value, so you won’t hit the $50 threshold
[2.12.24, 13:28:42] ~ NeuroCup: but still, most customers any not sure you would do that, or are even comfortable with that
[2.12.24, 13:29:15] ~ Mason Schulze: So who pays the tax
[2.12.24, 13:29:21] ~ Mason Schulze: The customer?
[2.12.24, 13:29:36] ~ NeuroCup: yes
[2.12.24, 13:29:37] ~ Mason Schulze: Because I'm based in Australia
[2.12.24, 13:30:37] ~ NeuroCup: they pay when they receive it through customs
[2.12.24, 13:33:52] ~ NeuroCup: you refund rates can be quite high also. some people are not aware of current taxes, and when receiving the tax bill they rather not pay and return the product ‎<This message was edited>
[2.12.24, 13:38:03] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh damn
[2.12.24, 13:40:17] ~ Mason Schulze: We started testing it with our winning product and saw huge amount of add to carts but very low conversion
[2.12.24, 13:40:41] ~ Mason Schulze: So wasn't sure what they were expecting to see in the checkout in that country
[2.12.24, 13:40:47] ~ Lucas Alves: but when you're working with an agent your customers doesn't need to pay taxes 

your agent will give you the price with taxes included
[2.12.24, 13:41:08] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh this is what I thought also
[2.12.24, 13:41:34] ~ Lucas Alves: which checkout do you using?
[2.12.24, 13:41:52] ~ Mason Schulze: Shopify
[2.12.24, 13:42:34] ~ Lucas Alves: try to use cartpand or appmax
[2.12.24, 13:43:01] ~ Mason Schulze: Is that what they are used to seeing in Brazil?
[2.12.24, 13:43:14] ~ Lucas Alves: yes
[2.12.24, 13:43:42] ~ Lucas Alves: but shopify checkout shouldn't be a problem

[2.12.24, 13:46:04] ~ Lucas Alves: what is your average order value?
[2.12.24, 13:46:19] ~ NeuroCup: PIX is also a must
[2.12.24, 13:46:41] ~ Mason Schulze: Nothing atm haha
[2.12.24, 13:46:47] ~ Lucas Alves: those checkouts that i mentioned will do all the job
[2.12.24, 13:46:51] ~ NeuroCup: these would solve your problems
[2.12.24, 13:46:52] ~ Mason Schulze: Only been running ads there for 2 days

[2.12.24, 18:19:28] ~ Steve: Make sure you guys run some extended BF offers

[2.12.24, 18:20:00] ~ Steve: Already got sales rolling in on static images
[2.12.24, 18:20:08] ~ Steve: Tomorrow full VSLs with that offer go live too
[2.12.24, 18:20:28] ~ Steve: Then at the end of the week we'll sit with our media buyer and go through all data from BFCM ads in total
[2.12.24, 18:20:42] ~ Steve: Any wins we will then repurpose for Xmas sales starting week of dec 10
[2.12.24, 18:21:00] ~ Steve: Run super urgency sales on them "order before Dec 18 to get it guaranteed by Xmas" type offers
[2.12.24, 18:26:22] ~ Davide: Make sense, but I mean I’d like to see or discuss with you guys which template in terms of funnel structure and copywriting strategies work better for you

[3.12.24, 17:26:12] ~ Igor: You need industrial designer or 3d artist for it. We did it by looking through behance and finding good young artists who are still studying and contacted them directly through email(they usually have it in behance profile). They are always happy for some paid side projects as students
[3.12.24, 18:42:38] ~ Viktor Zemann: i'm also looking for someone, who can do this kind of 3d animations https://desktronic.de/products/hohenverstellbarer-schreibtisch

[3.12.24, 19:48:55] ~ M: think shopify lets you do this with your phone if im not mistaken
[3.12.24, 20:09:24] ~ M A N U E L: Hey guys, how you usually find “untapped” and cheap creators you can work with to create contents for video ads?

[4.12.24, 0:21:29] ~ Marcos: Hey guys does anyone have a manager in their HK company that can recommend?
[4.12.24, 2:29:53] ~ Reus: Hello everyone,

Since November 19, I’ve been experiencing issues with my Shopify Payments gateway, preventing customers from completing purchases. The error code displayed is “do_not_honor.” Despite contacting Shopify customer support multiple times, they attribute the issue to the banks, while the banks insist it’s a problem on Shopify’s end.

The issue primarily affects customers in Denmark and now seems to extend across Scandinavia. However, transactions in the Netherlands continue to work without any problems. This has forced me to disable ads, resulting in significant daily losses.

To troubleshoot, I tested the Mollie gateway, and it worked flawlessly. This suggests the issue could be resolved on Shopify's side. The same problem occurred when using Stripe, and I’ve heard that Shopify Payments and Stripe are closely connected.

Has anyone else encountered a similar issue? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!
[4.12.24, 2:52:07] ~ Samy: Hey guys, my ad account just got restricted because it says that it can’t bill my credit card and not my back up payment methods either. Any one have a good Meta connection that can fix this?
[4.12.24, 3:20:29] ~ Aaron Ware: This happened to me. So annoying. I ended up having to switch to PayPal as the payment option.
[4.12.24, 3:20:46] ~ Aaron Ware: Which just takes it from the same card meta was
[4.12.24, 3:28:23] ~ Samy: Did you try multiple different cards before you switched aswell?
[4.12.24, 3:31:36] ~ Aaron Ware: Oh yep
[4.12.24, 3:31:47] ~ Aaron Ware: Tried everything you can imagine.
[4.12.24, 3:42:38] ~ Maksym: hey guys, does anyone have any shopify themes you could share, I got a couple hundred from a discord but most are outdated. Trying to switch it up for this new brand we’re working on.
[4.12.24, 3:43:20] ~ Azinco: I got latest turbo and motion
[4.12.24, 3:43:48] ~ Maksym: I’ll dm u

[4.12.24, 20:29:30] ~ Reus: Please any answer to this please
[4.12.24, 21:32:46] ~ Alex Lever: In the pet niche. But I model from all niches so anything you’ve got will be much appreciated

[4.12.24, 23:54:59] ~ Steve: so dont make the mistake of trying to run what they run and expect to win or get the same results
[4.12.24, 23:55:45] ~ Steve: some nice design stuff for sure, but i know people over there - they will even run funnels they know lose money just to throw the copycats off
[4.12.24, 23:56:02] ~ Davide: I saw your mega swipe you shared, a lot of value inside there👏🏻
[4.12.24, 23:56:08] ~ Steve: put it this way - they sold off just part of one of their brands for $300m (this is what I was told)
[4.12.24, 23:56:32] ~ Steve: so they are just on a different level - they are happy to pay $200+ to acquire a customer because they’re LTV is dialed
[4.12.24, 23:56:52] ~ Davide: Also, do you have something for this? @⁨~Steve⁩
[4.12.24, 23:57:07] ~ Steve: most of my swipes are for supplements
[4.12.24, 23:57:22] ~ Steve: most of what i have is in the mega folder I shared
[4.12.24, 23:58:25] ~ Davide: Got it
[4.12.24, 23:58:55] ~ Davide: Anyway besides that mega swipe, I think you guys have to take a look at funnel of the week
[4.12.24, 23:59:52] ~ Davide: Great service where basically every week they breakdown a different huge funnel of large brands for ecom
[5.12.24, 0:01:22] ~ Davide: And you have basically everything: front end offers, landing pages, advertorials, post purchases, sales flow, back end of emails, the calls with the founders
[5.12.24, 0:09:58] ~ Alex Lever: @⁨~Steve⁩ @⁨~Davide⁩ thanks guys 🙏

Im not US citizen and already provided them with my US business certificate, Bank Statement and both  got rejected. 

For the note when I opened this PP years ago I added my Business address as a personal address
[5.12.24, 3:59:53] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey guys if you were launching your product that's already done big numbers in US and UK to South American market with a new translated store and translated ads would you use the same pixel or start a new one?
[5.12.24, 8:10:09] ~ Davide: Not, I just shared a thank you page for Dr Marty’s brand
[5.12.24, 8:41:07] ~ Twizzylit: Yes
[5.12.24, 9:30:13] ~ Matt: Yh this is common mistake people make when looking at big players, same as AG1 I think they’re CAC is $250+.. any brands at low 8 figure range you look at?
[5.12.24, 9:32:10] ~ Nebil: Half of the time they’re only profitable because of Amazon, google & LTV.
[5.12.24, 9:32:41] ~ Nebil: Especially Amazon I saw the financials of a 50 mill profit a year company and 40% of their profit was from Amazon
[5.12.24, 9:33:22] ~ Nebil: They had a ton of influencer marketing campaigns and they caught the orders on Amazon
[5.12.24, 9:43:48] ~ Matt: Interesting
[5.12.24, 9:44:00] ~ Matt: I’ve been holding off on Amazon for a while

[5.12.24, 11:41:42] ~ Vish: Their service pretty good
[5.12.24, 11:46:44] ~ Gordon: Can vouch for these guys, also use them. It’s the only service that actually has their reviews stick
[5.12.24, 11:50:02] ~ Matt: Do they do geo specific reviews I.e. from US accounts ? Any issues with them sticking or not?
[5.12.24, 11:50:30] ~ Vish: Yeah it's GEO specific
[5.12.24, 11:50:37] ~ Vish: I do for US and EU
[5.12.24, 11:50:50] ~ Vish: And never had any issue
[5.12.24, 12:14:38] ~ Davi: hey guys anyone selling gift cards with different currency? hope shopify doesn’t manage multicurrency gift cards, anyone solved?

[5.12.24, 15:56:57] ~ M A N U E L: Yo guys, anyone can recommend someone with decent skills in 3d animations, GCI and VFX effects?
[5.12.24, 16:03:51] Topi: I know few
[5.12.24, 17:10:41] ~ Arad Khazabi: curious question:

why do people have "try" before their domain?

tryglamory.com

trynooro-us.com

is it because the original domain without "try" is not available?
[5.12.24, 17:11:04] ~ Arad Khazabi: "try" "get" "go", etc.
[5.12.24, 17:12:18] Topi: It might be availability

Or you shopify is ”xyz.com”

But in order for you to run separate acquisition funnels with separate domain you just create try.xyz.com
[5.12.24, 17:12:44] Topi: But no magic or anything performance related if you wonder that
[5.12.24, 17:13:01] ~ Bazeed: is anyone taking their fb VSL winners into youtube ads here?
[5.12.24, 17:13:04] ~ Arad Khazabi: okay understood, thanks Topi
[5.12.24, 20:45:47] ~ Jason Kwan: Which brand is this
[5.12.24, 21:41:24] ~ Yusuf: Hey, does anyone know someone very good at email marketing? I'd like to keep doing it in house but I'm open to pay for consulting to someone for especially strategy, like having weekly or monthly calls

I appreciate any legit contact
[5.12.24, 21:42:29] ~ Ry: how many % rev are u doing in flows/campaigns?
[5.12.24, 21:48:51] ~ Matt: Has anyone noticed a difference with getting engagement on ads like favourable comments etc to the CAC? Some people say it makes no difference but I would think logically of course it does as it looks like a real customer review
[5.12.24, 21:50:37] ~ Timotej: We have just started testing this, using a supplier someone in this group recommended. Don’t have enough data yet …unfortunately 😀
[5.12.24, 21:51:58] ~ Bazeed: 100% it does
[5.12.24, 21:52:18] ~ Bazeed: ran up the same ad in 2 ad acocunts one with boosted engagement has way lower cac and 2m views in 3 days
[5.12.24, 21:53:47] ~ Bazeed: use justanotherpanel.com

they have a custom comments service for very cheap, you tell gpt/claude to write 100 “facebook positive” comments for your product and paste into the panel
[5.12.24, 21:55:35] ~ Timotej: Great share, thanks! Need to check if they have EU profiles, since we are running only EU markets.
[5.12.24, 22:02:02] ~ Yusuf: i have 2 brands, big one is doing 16-18% rev from email

small one is 25-30%

big one is making over 150k rev per day
small one is currently making around 4-5k rev per day

especially want to improve big one
[5.12.24, 22:02:55] ~ Yusuf: yes i had massive difference
[5.12.24, 22:22:49] ~ NeuroCup: how many do you usually get?
[5.12.24, 22:23:58] ~ Ry: that’s really small. is it worth it to do inhouse? I can hook u up with someone who is helping me getting 30+ consistently for mentoring
[5.12.24, 22:38:00] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Anyone have insider for fb unbans ?
[5.12.24, 22:38:01] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Trustworthy

[5.12.24, 22:50:50] Amit Wadhawan: Hey guys! Are there any 3PLs you would recommend using in the US?

[5.12.24, 23:05:40] ~ Parker Godfrey: Revamp Fulfillment in Utah has been great for me
[5.12.24, 23:16:15] ~ Matt: So do you use these across all creatives launched to give them a boost? How many comments do you go after until effects start to dwindle ? 5-10?
‎[5.12.24, 23:19:27] ~ Matt: ‎image omitted
[5.12.24, 23:21:11] ~ Matt: And have you noticed if it matters the profiles commenting? I.e. do they look legit or just like bot accounts and obvious to anyone reading it? I need middle aged females US or EU
[5.12.24, 23:22:19] ~ Vish: I wouldn't recommend doing just another panel or any other platform
[5.12.24, 23:22:32] ~ Vish: Using these platforms leaves a ban hammer on your profiles
[5.12.24, 23:23:14] ~ Vish: Instead buy cheap profiles, load them on anti-detect and do the comments
[5.12.24, 23:23:22] ~ Vish: Use VA's for the comments
[5.12.24, 23:23:44] ~ Vish: The ban hammer affects your performance btw
[5.12.24, 23:28:14] ~ Chris: Where do you buy these profiles?
[5.12.24, 23:28:29] ~ Vish: I can connect you to my plug ‎<This message was edited>

[6.12.24, 6:42:49] ~ Mason Schulze: Yes can help you out dm me
[6.12.24, 8:04:10] ~ Bazeed: i usually only do it on creatives that have a good avg playtime right after launching them and if i see signs it will scale big

i start off with about 50 comments and 500-1000 likes. all of this is about $2-3 extremely cheap on the panel
[6.12.24, 8:04:34] ~ Bazeed: Yep
[6.12.24, 8:04:53] ~ Bazeed: yes they have different countries there from where you want the people to comment from

[6.12.24, 10:18:26] ~ Num: Hi Guys My Wise bank account has been frozen following an application by an investigator through the court. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I
[6.12.24, 10:25:08] ~ Nebil: ‎This message was deleted.
[6.12.24, 10:46:53] ~ Matt: Interesting so if avg playtime is good then you seed some comments and likes on it, do you stagger this each day or all at once? How long after do you see CAC go down?
[6.12.24, 11:04:26] ~ Bazeed: i just do it at once,

also it wont work if the ads are not good, i only do this since each of my ad is a 5-15min vsl which has elite level copy so i know its going to perform. this is just a cherry on top of cake to get the algorithm working for me
[6.12.24, 12:28:44] ~ Matt: Thanks I’m going to give it a try on some early stage winning ads and see how they perform 🤝

[7.12.24, 12:45:13] ~ RS: I work with them since June and every time everything was good. Dont know what happened this time. Also, they notified me that from 2025 there will be no cashbacks because meta have removed cashbacks. Now I have 5% cashback but starting 2025 there will be no cashback.
[7.12.24, 12:45:48] ~ RS: Did Bestfulfill notify you about cashback cancellation?
[7.12.24, 12:46:23] ~ Num: no
[7.12.24, 12:52:27] ~ Facundo: same here
[7.12.24, 12:52:43] ~ Tom: Same
[7.12.24, 12:52:52] ~ RS: …. No words
[7.12.24, 12:53:21] ~ Num: they even don’t communicate
[7.12.24, 12:53:56] ~ Tom: Yeah same here
[7.12.24, 12:53:57] ~ Tom: Account has been off for 6hours now… during the weekend EU prime hours 🫡
[7.12.24, 12:54:18] ~ RS: Damn.
[7.12.24, 12:54:41] ~ Num: i don’t want to think something i shouldn’t think hhh
[7.12.24, 12:54:46] ~ RS: Its off because balance run out or they shut it off ‎<This message was edited>
[7.12.24, 12:55:00] ~ RS: ?
[7.12.24, 12:55:26] ~ Alex: ''Hey team, 

There has been today an incident with our ad accounts, and we must change all your ads under new business manager.

Rest assured, all your funds will restored. 

Unfortunately, this affects all our clients. 

We’re truly sorry for the inconvenience this causes and keep working together with meta ensuring something like these will never happen in the future. 

Thank you for giving us time to investigate before our reply. 

We’ll keep you updated.''
[7.12.24, 12:56:15] ~ Facundo: in my case, they shut it off
[7.12.24, 12:56:29] ~ RS: So the same ad accounts will be transfered to a New business manager? I hope I will not need to make New ads and campaigns from the scratch😀
[7.12.24, 12:56:59] ~ Tom: Apparently not
[7.12.24, 12:57:04] ~ Alex: Yeah exactly, just got access to the new account the data is transferred over so you don't lose campaigns
[7.12.24, 12:57:14] ~ Tom: “the hack attacked us when we are sleeping and I think that's why thy choose to attack us this time because there have holidays”
[7.12.24, 12:58:00] ~ Num: they topup back your ad account?
[7.12.24, 12:58:01] ~ Aaron Ware: Anyone else doing cashbacks?
[7.12.24, 13:01:39] ~ Michael: Guys how can a friend of mine join the group?
[7.12.24, 13:24:14] Topi: yes
[7.12.24, 13:37:45] ~ Alex: They got hacked and a lot of people have account balances emptied
[7.12.24, 13:38:40] ~ Alex: Mine was okay but im considering turning them off, dataset wasn't connected to the new account they gave and it blew 5k in the last 90 mins on nothing
[7.12.24, 17:07:52] ~ Facundo: anyone got their accounts back?
[7.12.24, 18:09:29] ~ Tom: Yeah, just got it
[7.12.24, 20:50:01] ~ Bazeed: anyone knows how to turn cypto to usd without exchanges
[7.12.24, 20:50:14] ~ Bazeed: or use crypto for adspend, any cyrpto to prepaid card sites
[7.12.24, 20:50:15] ~ Bazeed: ?
[7.12.24, 21:51:56] ~ Aaron Ware: Can you send contact please
[8.12.24, 1:23:19] ~ Parker Godfrey: Anyone’s else’s Shopify dashboard bugging out not showing any numbers rn?
[8.12.24, 1:25:42] ~ Henry: Anyone else’s Meta ads stopped spending today? It hasn’t even spent half of our daily budget yet and it’s about to be the end of the day
[8.12.24, 1:30:28] ~ Erne: Yes. Go check your daily ad spend limit, should be about 100$. Pay manually one invoice, your daily limit should increase again and it’s gonna start spend. ‎<This message was edited>
[8.12.24, 1:34:07] ~ Henry: Yep! It’s exactly what you said. Do you know why this is happening? my account has had over $300k in ad spend on it so this limit doesn’t make sense
[8.12.24, 1:34:35] ~ Erne: No idea man. Happened to me and to many other people today, I think is just a bug. ‎<This message was edited>
[8.12.24, 1:36:06] ~ Henry: Thanks brother! Very glad to know
[8.12.24, 10:38:51] ~ Mikael: Have anyone got ad accounts banned/disabled and not got any information at all from Meta on whats going on and why? no email. nothing.
[8.12.24, 10:40:13] ~ Bazeed: yep got mine, got an email that apparently they think someone accessed my fb profile
[8.12.24, 10:40:51] ~ Mikael: Yeah but Ive had 2 ad accounts banned now. without any information. nothing. its super weird. usually I get email About Everything going on with Meta
[8.12.24, 11:01:08] ~ Mikael: Is it able to get "attacked" by a insider and ad accounts taken down for random reasons?
[8.12.24, 12:17:57] ~ Marcos: Yes it could be
[8.12.24, 12:18:23] ~ Marcos: You should pay an insider to reactivate
[8.12.24, 12:18:33] ~ Marcos: Or maybe talk with you fb rep
[8.12.24, 16:51:29] ~ Matt: Any supp sellers what have you found the best performing offer you have run? I know this completely varies per brand but I want to push subscriptions + get higher AOV

I have been running a 1 month, 3 month and 6 month supply and extra 20% off for subs + free gifts but I’m thinking a 1 month, 2 month, 3 month might be better for cold traffic - less likely to get someone to commit for 6 months than 2 or 3
[8.12.24, 17:33:07] ~ Ilda: Anyone shipping from China, are the tarrifs going to mess things up, or is it a worthwhile switch
[8.12.24, 17:36:14] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Only if ur doing legitimate bulk shipping where you have to do customs clearance. There will probably be 10% tariff added on top of the 25% one. However the way most e-commerce brands ship in bulk to US, it’s a DDP shipping method. So you may see the shipping rates for that shipping method go up a little but not enough to mess things up.  Fulfillment from China won’t be affected because anything under $800 in value is exempt from tariffs.
[8.12.24, 19:06:31] ~ Robert: Depends on which country ur shipping to. America is fine.
[9.12.24, 8:46:57] ~ Mithiran: Any recommendation for payment processors?
[9.12.24, 9:05:44] ~ Tom: also interested!
[9.12.24, 9:51:08] ~ Powa: For US?
[9.12.24, 9:52:18] ~ Bazeed: hey guys, started a new store in us, with a new pixel and agency ad account testing $200/day. 

the ads are good but not getting any add to carts or sales i think its because of the pixel and ad account completely new, any suggestions on how to get the pixel warmed up? (also doing broad targeting)
[9.12.24, 9:58:40] ~ Mithiran: I’m aus based but selling in USA
[9.12.24, 10:00:48] ~ Powa: Dm me if you want an intro
[9.12.24, 10:09:05] ~ Rustam: If you receive no purchase intent, it’s either your ads are bad, or your offer/product is bad bro. At $200 a day you should be receiving at least some purchases within the first couple of days if you have a winner
[9.12.24, 10:09:56] ~ Rustam: I see pixel optimizing pretty well after around $5k adspend in one niche personally
[9.12.24, 10:10:13] ~ Bazeed: hmm hook rate and avg play time are both high on vsls
[9.12.24, 10:10:38] ~ Bazeed: might have to change the mechanism / social proof etc
[9.12.24, 10:22:04] ~ N: What’s ur CPMs like there
‎[9.12.24, 10:26:46] ~ Bazeed: ‎image omitted
[9.12.24, 10:27:21] ~ Bazeed: stared 3 days ago, think its the offer/mechanism itself that might not be the best
[9.12.24, 10:27:44] Topi: Just fast glance seeing this and sneak peak into your numbers i agree
[9.12.24, 10:28:24] ~ Bazeed: yep like u said low cvr high playtime = bad mechanism
[9.12.24, 10:28:50] Topi: Yeah or offer
[9.12.24, 10:28:58] Topi: But mechanism usually fixes it for us
[9.12.24, 10:29:20] ~ Bazeed: its also a neew ad account + pixel that might be making it worse
[9.12.24, 10:29:29] ~ Bazeed: not getting any intent for purchase /atc
[9.12.24, 16:24:08] ~ Jeremy: Hey guys, anyone here tried the app ABConvert?
Its way cheaper than the other split test app like intelligem and I was wondering if it was the same quality
[9.12.24, 16:24:35] ~ M A N U E L: I use that on one of my stores, works fine
[9.12.24, 16:24:54] ~ Jeremy: Okay thanks man!
[10.12.24, 3:37:58] ~ Pramesh: ‎~ Lucio Martinez added ~ Pramesh
[9.12.24, 17:25:13] ~ Rahman: Any advice on where I can find a good mentor?
[9.12.24, 17:34:06] ~ Matt: Mentor pass is good if you don’t want to be locked in
[9.12.24, 17:34:43] ~ Maksym: offer sucks bro
[9.12.24, 17:45:44] ~ Rahman: Thanks, have you used this platform before?
[9.12.24, 18:40:56] ~ Matt: I haven’t but I did have a mentor which cost a few k per month and whilst it was super helpful in the beginning, after a few months we had action points to work on and not much to discuss in the bi weekly meeting I think if you can dip into it with a specific question it’s better than a high monthly cost (unless you get it for free of course)
[9.12.24, 18:51:39] ~ Andrej: yea, mentor pass is great. Or just reach out to people ahead of you and try to get them on a call. Wouldn’t recommend anyone who says he can be your “mentor“.
[9.12.24, 19:13:17] ~ NeuroCup: what’s your CTR and connect rate?
[9.12.24, 19:27:44] ~ Bazeed: about 3%ctr (all)
[9.12.24, 19:31:30] ~ Matt: Anyone seen any difference with paying for the ‘Meta Verified’ badge? It’s 10 per month
[9.12.24, 19:39:48] ~ Ry: Personally no noticeable difference in terms of sales. But still having it
[9.12.24, 19:44:11] ~ Nick Jansen: same
[9.12.24, 19:52:52] ~ NeuroCup: and unique link click?
[9.12.24, 20:11:39] ~ Bazeed: about 2.5%
[9.12.24, 20:19:43] ~ NeuroCup: Are you using advertorial or straight to product page?
[9.12.24, 20:20:30] ~ NeuroCup: how many content views?
[9.12.24, 22:07:57] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: Hi, does anybody has experience working with https://www.ugcfactory.io/ to create ugc? Thanks
[9.12.24, 22:09:23] ~ BG: Yes and Personally wasn’t worth it.
[9.12.24, 22:10:06] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: May i know why? I was having sales call with them yesterday
[9.12.24, 22:12:39] ~ BG: My own ads outperformed them, That dosent mean that there not any good it just wasn’t worth it for us. ‎<This message was edited>
[9.12.24, 22:16:05] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: I see, appreciate the feedback 👍
[9.12.24, 23:20:53] ~ Filippo: Anyone knows a Shopify insider for DMCA issues?
[9.12.24, 23:32:40] ~ chris: For people on hk , how are you guys dealing the very high transaction fees? Are there any workarounds ?
[10.12.24, 2:26:20] ~ M: Hey, anyone got advice need a few influencers to film organic feeling review videos for a cream for eczema? But just wanna know how to get good quality ones?
[10.12.24, 2:26:25] ~ M: Videos*
[10.12.24, 11:41:49] ~ Davide: Do you guys have any contacts to buy Instagram pages with already 5k-10k followers?
[10.12.24, 12:41:08] ~ Matt: Has anyone seen any downside for a new brand buying Facebook and instagram likes in their ads? Do you think it makes CPMs higher?
[10.12.24, 12:42:00] Topi: if you do this 3rd party service you might get shadow banned, happened for us
[10.12.24, 12:42:20] Topi: not a gut feeling, insider showed us there was a red stamp in our account and this was the reason
[10.12.24, 12:45:25] ~ Vish: Yeah he right about this
[10.12.24, 12:45:38] ~ Vish: That happened with us as well
[10.12.24, 12:47:23] Topi: There’s a service for real comments and likes, dm if need intro, but do not buy from these like sites i recommend
[10.12.24, 13:35:11] ~ Bazeed: does this impact the whole ad account or just the fb/ig page?
[10.12.24, 13:37:05] Topi: not sure @⁨~Bazeed⁩ our insider just removed the ban, this happened maybe 6 months ago dont remember exactly
[10.12.24, 13:39:10] ~ Vish: It impacts your ads and pages both
[10.12.24, 13:40:03] ~ Matt: Yh I’ve seen that, any way to reverse the damage done?
[10.12.24, 13:40:47] ~ Matt: It was only 2000 so wasn’t crazy amount
[10.12.24, 13:40:55] ~ Matt: But I feel it’s pushed my CPMs higher
[10.12.24, 13:42:30] Topi: @⁨~Matt⁩ dm so ill connect with the same insider who fixed for us
[10.12.24, 16:13:50] ~ NeuroCup: all at once?
[10.12.24, 16:18:50] ~ Matt: Yh pretty much
[10.12.24, 19:54:13] ~ Jonny: Anyone seeing terrible results the past 2-3 days?
[10.12.24, 19:54:35] ~ Christopher Murphy: Yes
[10.12.24, 19:54:50] ~ Mithiran: Results for us are pretty decent. Introduced post purchase upsells which changed the game for us
[10.12.24, 20:04:35] ~ Cody Chaffee: nah, the past week my cpa’s have gone down 50%
[10.12.24, 20:44:45] ~ Davide: Did you add upsells “more of the same” or like “done for you”?
[10.12.24, 20:52:20] ~ Mithiran: More of the same. We did a VSL.

What do u mean by done for you?
[10.12.24, 20:54:41] ~ Facundo: More of the same
[10.12.24, 21:04:30] ~ Matt: VSL on why to buy more of the same?
[10.12.24, 21:04:40] ~ Matt: What did you go over in it?
[10.12.24, 21:06:44] ~ Mithiran: Yeah, we copied a nooro post purchase VSL flow.

Basically it goes from 

Info about how to use the product -> we noticed that the best customers did something different to get amazing results -> turns out it is having multiple of the products -> so we gave it to you at a discount because we save on shipping
[10.12.24, 21:06:55] ~ Mithiran: Our product is one time purchase so we had to convince them more to buy more
[10.12.24, 21:07:02] ~ Mithiran: 30% take rate so far
[10.12.24, 21:42:46] ~ Bazeed: nice
[10.12.24, 22:30:58] ~ Davide: done for you is basically an upsell that complete the front end offers. 
VSLs performs well for post purchase in both cases
[10.12.24, 22:31:38] ~ Dorian: ‎~ Lucio Martinez added ~ Dorian
[10.12.24, 22:46:52] ~ Matt: Is this a custom coded site or do you use an app for the VSL integration?
[10.12.24, 23:16:51] ~ Davide: all of you guys use 11labs? 
Did you try other software better for creating realistic voice-overs? ‎<This message was edited>

[11.12.24, 5:07:14] ~ Lucas Alves: hey guys
[11.12.24, 5:07:35] ~ Lucas Alves: im launching a LATAM op, is it normal for the Release Cod Form not to trigger the value parameters in the purchase event?
‎[11.12.24, 5:08:37] ~ Lucas Alves: ‎image omitted
‎[11.12.24, 5:09:23] ~ Lucas Alves: ‎image omitted
[11.12.24, 5:09:33] ~ Maksym: how did you set up pixel
[11.12.24, 5:10:00] ~ Maksym: COD forms, are order placements not necessarily payment complete
[11.12.24, 5:10:30] ~ Lucas Alves: yeah but i expected to see the order value when someone complete the order
[11.12.24, 5:10:32] ~ NeuroCup: did you set the fb api pixel?
[11.12.24, 5:10:38] ~ Maksym: to be honest though, I don’t remember how we set it up a while back
[11.12.24, 5:10:39] ~ Lucas Alves: yeah
[11.12.24, 5:10:55] ~ Lucas Alves: i set up api AND pixel
[11.12.24, 5:10:59] ~ Maksym: in shopify?
[11.12.24, 5:11:33] ~ Lucas Alves: in pixel events
[11.12.24, 5:11:41] ~ Lucas Alves: like im seeing add to cart parameters
[11.12.24, 5:12:14] ~ Lucas Alves: im reaching out releasit support
[11.12.24, 5:12:17] ~ Maksym: Never had this issue, but I’d recommend describing it in detail and asking chatgpt what could be the reason

then going from there
[11.12.24, 5:12:32] ~ Lucas Alves: ill bring news if i have any
[11.12.24, 5:12:40] ~ NeuroCup: on the realisit app?
[11.12.24, 5:12:56] ~ Lucas Alves: on releasit too
[11.12.24, 5:13:34] ~ NeuroCup: that’s weird
[11.12.24, 5:13:37] ~ NeuroCup: how many events did you had?
[11.12.24, 5:14:21] ~ NeuroCup: it usually works fine. what I had is some missing events, and late refresh
[11.12.24, 5:14:36] ~ Lucas Alves: im launching this OP in colombia this week

new ad account, pixel and everything

my main op is in brazil
[11.12.24, 5:14:43] ~ Lucas Alves: oh okay
[11.12.24, 5:14:50] ~ NeuroCup: like just showing up half a day later
[11.12.24, 5:14:54] ~ Lucas Alves: ill launch some ads and lets see
[11.12.24, 5:16:35] ~ Lucas Alves: if u guys are running cod, can u just confirm if your pixel is measuring theses parameters?
[11.12.24, 5:17:32] ~ NeuroCup: i’m.  it’s working fine
[11.12.24, 5:17:59] ~ NeuroCup: try to see if the other values are working, like atc total value
[11.12.24, 5:18:21] ~ NeuroCup: and get in contact with them. they are pretty fast to answer
[11.12.24, 5:18:33] ~ Lucas Alves: yeahh, it is working
[11.12.24, 5:18:44] ~ Lucas Alves: doing this right now
[11.12.24, 5:18:51] ~ Lucas Alves: thank you anyway guys!
[11.12.24, 5:19:03] ~ Lucas Alves: ill bring news if i solve this problem
[11.12.24, 7:04:36] ~ Mithiran: I used lightfunnels, recommended by someone on here actually.

 I have dynamic variants so funnelish or checkoutchamp didn’t work

It’s html element on the lightfunnels page for hiding the product but that takes like an hour create using chatgpt
[11.12.24, 8:06:01] ~ Mithiran: do you have a swipe or example of this? Looking to crossell something similar as well

[11.12.24, 17:12:13] ~ Steve: focus more on creating a real brand that ads real value to real people and therefore has real valuable content for humans - this is what Meta wants anyways for their customer experience so be a brand that gives it to them
[11.12.24, 17:13:05] ~ Steve: Focus less on just being another cash machine derivative of whatever the top selling product is in your niche (i.e. the 900th Knee Massager Brand) and focus on products you can build a moat or community around
[11.12.24, 17:13:21] ~ Steve: exiting from those is harder and harder anyways
[11.12.24, 17:14:17] ~ Steve: and go omni channel. For us we’re now up on Shop, will run TikTok Ads, Meta Ads, getting up on Amazon, eventually will do some native and once we have a little more bankroll, take a stab at youtube.
[11.12.24, 17:14:54] ~ Steve: if you’re a health brand running 100% paid ads on meta for your acquisition making wild ass health claims = you’re gonna have a bad time in 2025
[11.12.24, 19:54:50] ~ Matt: Has anyone got any good resources on how to approach offer testing to really nail it? What data do you look at to make your next hypothesis etc
[11.12.24, 20:54:17] ~ Omar: are u doing vsl type ads?
[11.12.24, 21:17:38] ~ Jonny: Anyone here running Tik Tok ads or has done in the past? 

Looking for aged accounts with spend history to buy.
[11.12.24, 21:46:34] ~ Matt: Not at the moment no just standard creative (statics, videos etc but not VSL) to long form landing page
[11.12.24, 22:00:07] ~ Growg: Hey anyone faced meta down, Seems Meta is down since last 30 min

[11.12.24, 22:01:15] ~ Christopher Murphy: Yep, can’t get into business manager
[11.12.24, 22:02:20] ~ Charles: Idk about you but performance is already really bad for us today
[11.12.24, 22:02:22] ~ Landon: Yes. It’s been down for a while. https://metastatus.com/ads-manager
[11.12.24, 22:02:48] ~ Dorian: for me it's okay not a bad day and not an really good day
[11.12.24, 22:03:02] ~ Growg: yeah, really bad.. us audience

[11.12.24, 22:25:03] ~ Matt: But we are in supplements so not the most giftable product
[11.12.24, 22:27:20] ~ Aaron Ware: So true my product was delayed in the post and this woman sent me an email “ Shame on you! I’ve been scammed again from a stupid Facebook ad! Sending me fake tracking links! Karma will come for you. I’m never using Facebook again!” 

And now I really see why meta needs to protect the platform.
[11.12.24, 22:28:05] ~ Steve: Haha fair enough, but I don't think that's the reason the why. It's legal stuff they're worried about
[11.12.24, 22:28:17] ~ Steve: I'd be concerned if I was also processing all on stripe too
[11.12.24, 22:28:28] ~ Steve: They're gonna go public in 2025 and probably get tight on shit too
[11.12.24, 22:28:39] ~ Aaron Ware: Oh noooo 😞
[11.12.24, 22:29:16] ~ Steve: These aren't serious until you start getting death threats and someone attacking personal accounts of your employees. People be crazy out there. I've seen a ton of shit over the years, especially in supps
[11.12.24, 22:29:17] ~ Dorian: every potential customer is afraid about buy a new time because they are scammed 2/3 and i didn't understand how is it possible
[11.12.24, 22:30:13] ~ Aaron Ware: Haha that’s hectic
[11.12.24, 22:37:45] ~ Ishroop: Anyone know any good china 3pls?

[11.12.24, 23:16:35] ~ Jonas Ma: Hey there! Nice to meet you all. Is anyone in here thinking about selling his/her shop? Hmu 🤝🏻 I am looking to buy something currently

Preferably sth in US but Europe would be also fine.
[12.12.24, 2:26:27] ~ Aaron Ware: Chat gpt and meta down same day 🤔

[12.12.24, 10:44:55] ~ Gideon: Do you guys add catalog items to image and video ads?
[12.12.24, 10:54:08] ~ Filippo: Usually not
[12.12.24, 10:56:27] ~ Andrej: Usually yes
[12.12.24, 13:14:01] ~ FE: I'm fairly new to the HK setup, which bank should I be using to get the revenue paid on?
[12.12.24, 13:16:01] ~ Wouter: Whats hk setup?
[12.12.24, 13:20:42] ~ Bazeed: airwallex is decent, hsbc, etc are harder to open and youll need to physically go there for it
[12.12.24, 13:23:30] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Also make sure if you are using airwallex as a bank never use it even for once as a payment processor tho I was dumb and did that mistake and they not only held my payouts but also held 100% of money I had in the bank account and after getting the lawyer message they wasted my two weeks and then released 80%

[12.12.24, 13:36:07] ~ Ateeb Shahdhar: Facebook has been bugging since last night, they're fixing it
[12.12.24, 13:36:13] ~ Ateeb Shahdhar: The tracking is also messed up
[12.12.24, 14:24:34] ~ chris: Do you just recommend using shopify payments for payment processing?
[12.12.24, 14:25:34] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah so far it's the best if you're experienced and doing everything correct, but if you doing selling USA then authorize.net and maverick payments are good option too bro
[12.12.24, 14:27:49] ~ chris: allright good to know ! We were considering transitioning to airwallex at first due to the fee difference but well definitely reconsider
[12.12.24, 15:34:30] ~ Caesar: Guys do you notice the tracking on Meta being worse in the last 3-5 days? We are seeing ONLY 20-30% of TOTAL sales actually tracked inside the ads manager...
[12.12.24, 15:43:12] ~ harshil Thummar: Performance is also worse in meta from last 2 months
[12.12.24, 16:08:39] ~ ...: Is it safe to give your PP email address to someone to unfreeze the held fund on PayPal
[12.12.24, 16:12:19] Topi: without knowing anything about your situation, i’d be extremely extremely careful. I think we gave for this but it was a lawyer we’ve met in person multiple times
[12.12.24, 16:14:54] ~ ...: Oh I see. This is what I through too. 

Could they release your fund?
[12.12.24, 16:15:38] Topi: We’ve had 100% lockdown twice and partial ongoing always
[12.12.24, 16:15:48] Topi: 100% opened once, partial we got amount lowered
[12.12.24, 16:15:57] Topi: now again 100% and same lawyer working on it
[12.12.24, 16:15:58] Topi: it
[12.12.24, 16:16:28] Topi: it’s some of their automation that keeps flagging our account and they open it after lots of emails, just frustrating and costly
[12.12.24, 16:50:24] Topi: Hey team, anyone by chance ever used any invoicing solution in EU markets? Sending invoice to customer after purchase. Not klarna but other solutions
[12.12.24, 16:51:25] ~ Gideon: For shopify?
[12.12.24, 16:51:35] Topi: yeah you can do it with shopify
[12.12.24, 16:52:06] ~ Gideon: We use Vify app to automatically send an invoice after shipment
[12.12.24, 17:14:13] ~ Jonny: Anyone know of any tik tok ad account agency’s?

[12.12.24, 20:39:59] ~ Lucas Alves: send us these metrics:

click links
landing page views
[12.12.24, 20:42:08] ~ Bazeed: you mean link cpc?
‎[12.12.24, 20:43:13] ~ Bazeed: ‎image omitted
[12.12.24, 21:29:15] ~ Giorgos: Damn. Unscalable CPCs
[12.12.24, 21:39:01] ~ Bazeed: i think the page is new as well and pixel too which makes it worse
[12.12.24, 21:39:10] ~ Bazeed: anyone has a plug on where to buy aged facebook pages
[12.12.24, 21:42:37] ~ Omar: Ur better off buying them from some random VAs on upwork

They would sell old pages for $2 a page but get them to rename it first coz sometime fb don’t let
[12.12.24, 21:44:52] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Upwork ones are fine? I buy one from 70$ fkin reinstated USA aged, having all genuine chats and the page performs the worst having 4$ cpcs for 25$ SP product
[12.12.24, 21:46:47] ~ Giorgos: Try stronger Scroll Stopper Visual... Almost ''Click bait" them into ur page. Do you have a clear enough CTA? These two should  work for CPC, CTR
[12.12.24, 21:51:31] ~ Bazeed: yeah man all of it, u can see from tbe ss i have over 40%+ hook rate..
[12.12.24, 21:55:52] ~ Michael: hey guys where is the best and cheap way to open a new mexico mexico easily?
[12.12.24, 22:00:58] ~ Matt: I’ve noticed the same with new pages
[12.12.24, 22:01:39] ~ Matt: Worst are brand linked new pages because meta must know it’s a business, I tested whitelisted pages I made myself and CPMs were 20% cheaper
[12.12.24, 22:02:38] ~ NeuroCup: what’s your CTR link click percentage?
[12.12.24, 22:03:34] ~ NeuroCup: did you tried any pricing test?
[12.12.24, 22:04:13] ~ NeuroCup: would be better if you could share all the metrics of your funnel
[12.12.24, 22:10:56] ~ Davide: What do you mean?
[12.12.24, 22:14:14] ~ Matt: How do you approach this for a new store if there statistical significance would need a few hundred sales?
[12.12.24, 22:14:43] ~ Matt: The statistical*
[12.12.24, 22:17:31] ~ Andrea: If you want to have a proper serious test you can run a two-tailed analysis looking at the z-score, p value and its observed power, with a 95% CI. There's free tools for this online
[12.12.24, 22:17:36] ~ Bazeed: 3%, and no - no price tests. was going similar to competitors
[12.12.24, 22:18:19] ~ Bazeed: bro is this maths or something?
[12.12.24, 22:18:37] ~ Bazeed: my highschool dropout mind cant comprehend this
[12.12.24, 22:19:17] ~ NeuroCup: You don’t actually need statistical significance. I just tested a product in a bundle for 3x for $149. yesterday, changed the offer to 2x for $99. Getting 3x more sales with same exact traffic
[12.12.24, 22:20:20] ~ Andrea: ahah yeah its some statistics to see if the data is absolutely random or there's some significance to it
[12.12.24, 22:20:51] ~ Bazeed: makes sense, but i already went with the most suitable pricing, i did 1x and 2x for bundles. so tried to keep it as low barrier as possivle. i think its more of pixel/ fb page related issues for me
[12.12.24, 22:26:21] ~ NeuroCup: to test if it’s pricing related, you can go with really low prices, like supply levels/almost no markup 

if still don’t get sales, it’s definitely not price related - or the product itself is too high priced for the benefit. something you wouldn’t actually be able to change and it’s best to change products
[12.12.24, 22:28:28] ~ Matt: Let’s say you get your pricing in a good place what’s the next thing you test? Headline or above the fold images?
[12.12.24, 22:31:39] ~ Andrea: Cool stuff to test but its very low return on investment.. probably creatives forever realistically
[12.12.24, 22:31:48] ~ Lucas Alves: try using microsoft clarity, it will give you some directions to optimize the product page
[12.12.24, 22:32:30] ~ Lucas Alves: it will record the sessions on ur website and you can watch what people click/observe in your store
[12.12.24, 22:32:59] ~ Lucas Alves: anything other than that is a blind test
[12.12.24, 22:33:11] ~ Lucas Alves: pretty easy to install and free for use
[12.12.24, 22:33:41] ~ Austin: MC is the way
[12.12.24, 22:33:50] ~ Austin: Have it on every funnel
[12.12.24, 22:34:27] ~ Lucas Alves: https://clarity.microsoft.com/lang/en-us
[12.12.24, 22:35:06] ~ NeuroCup: depends how good and explanatory was your ads/advertorial. if you had they already got some good sense of the what the product is, changing the images won’t do too much. but you could def hit some other angles with headlines
[12.12.24, 22:35:30] ~ NeuroCup: yep, good bet
[12.12.24, 22:35:49] ~ NeuroCup: unless your lp is really lacking
[12.12.24, 22:43:32] ~ Matt: Yh that makes sense cheers 👍
[13.12.24, 0:06:07] ~ Steve: anyone has a google ads person they recommend working with?

[13.12.24, 9:32:25] ~ Bazeed: im having ad account restrictions and all sorts of issues from past 1 week
[13.12.24, 9:32:56] ~ Bazeed: now they banned one of  my prepaid accounts and saying they cant refund the balance in it
[13.12.24, 9:33:07] ~ Nick Jansen: Cpm was killing us when black was around the corner 🤷🏻‍♂️

And we did a price raise of 10$ on dark lord advice 😁
[13.12.24, 10:06:43] ~ Mithiran: did you split test it or just change the price?
[13.12.24, 10:24:55] ~ Nick Jansen: We had 7 days of loss with Black Friday period so I had a just fock it moment and it work out perfect 🙈😂

[14.12.24, 1:48:13] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I got that from Ecom plug it was a law firm, they charge 500$ as a deposit for sending the letter to the hk court and they take a % of money they get you out of reserve
[14.12.24, 1:48:40] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Usually like 10-12%
[14.12.24, 1:49:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I had 60k£ stuck in that airwallex

[14.12.24, 5:55:57] ~ Steve: Were absolutely cooking last 6 weeks
[14.12.24, 5:56:17] ~ Steve: Today probably worst day in 2 months. no action to be taken. Just 1 day of data
[14.12.24, 5:58:08] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh fuck same, down 50% compared to yesterday
[14.12.24, 5:58:26] ~ Mason Schulze: But before today last 7 days was great
[14.12.24, 5:58:36] ~ Mason Schulze: Wonder what caused it
[14.12.24, 5:59:01] ~ Steve: About the same for us
[14.12.24, 5:59:17] ~ Steve: Maybe just fatigue. Our black Friday ads were still absolutely smashing. Yesterday was a record day again
[14.12.24, 5:59:25] ~ Steve: So we have just kept them on lol
[14.12.24, 5:59:48] ~ Steve: Maybe they finally ran out. We have 15-20 new ads going live between now and monday
[14.12.24, 5:59:55] ~ Steve: See if those help
[14.12.24, 6:01:00] ~ Mason Schulze: I think it's just something to do with the algo on meta today

[14.12.24, 20:07:51] ~ Caesar: Yes, super strange, we scaled hard today as well since its Saturday (usually a super good day for us), bad days happen is what it is.
[14.12.24, 20:11:12] ~ Steve: Slow day for sure but much better than yesterday
[14.12.24, 20:11:20] ~ Steve: We're still tracking for a huge month
[14.12.24, 20:16:14] ~ Mithiran: Today for us wasn't that bad tbh. Literally one day after cyber monday, performance started picking up and its been pretty consistent. Super weird, has anyone else seen something similar?
[14.12.24, 20:16:30] ~ Andrea: Normal performance for us
[14.12.24, 20:16:53] ~ Steve: Yeah all.our metrics look good just lower conversion
[14.12.24, 20:17:09] ~ Steve: Black Friday stuff stopped crushing for us yesterday
[14.12.24, 20:17:27] ~ Steve: So just means that trend is over. Fatigue. We ran BF as hard and long as we could
[14.12.24, 20:17:50] ~ Steve: Now push Xmas based on what worked for BF, then get into new year new you messaging  in 2 weeks
[14.12.24, 20:29:56] ~ Charles: When is your last date to ship for Xmas?
[14.12.24, 20:30:30] ~ Charles: For us it was yesterday and we let the countdown on our website so I’m pretty sure this played a big role in our performance
[14.12.24, 20:30:31] ~ Steve: 16
[14.12.24, 20:30:43] ~ Steve: We already started Xmas stuff a week ago
[14.12.24, 20:30:44] ~ Charles: That’s pretty good
[14.12.24, 20:31:18] ~ Steve: Technically if they bought priority we could get it there if they buy 17th
[14.12.24, 20:31:23] ~ Steve: But can't guarantee it
[14.12.24, 20:31:50] ~ Steve: By this time next year we'll be shipping from 3PL in the us
[14.12.24, 20:31:53] ~ Steve: Much shorter times
[14.12.24, 20:32:50] ~ Charles: Great move
[14.12.24, 20:33:01] ~ Charles: Its like 5-6 days I think
[14.12.24, 20:33:28] ~ Steve: Yeah 2025 will be all about branding and that stuff for us rather than just obsessing on being a cash machine and top line revenue
[14.12.24, 20:33:55] ~ Steve: How do we optimize for brand, repeat purchase, LTV, moat, and become something that someone actually wants to acquire
[14.12.24, 20:35:05] ~ Steve: Hyper efficient cash machines who are only good at front end acquisition and have given no thought to their brand equity and  repeat business are just not as attractive for exits
[14.12.24, 20:35:33] ~ Steve: But it's a 3+ year plan for us anyways. Lots of time
[14.12.24, 20:37:43] ~ Charles: That’s the goal!
[14.12.24, 20:39:00] ~ Charles: For us lately it’s creatives.. we’ve been struggling to find new winning ads ,and this shows
[14.12.24, 20:39:39] Amit Wadhawan: Are you currently shipping from China? What niche are you in?
[14.12.24, 20:39:56] ~ Steve: We're in health. Functional hydration
[14.12.24, 20:40:19] Amit Wadhawan: Nice!
[14.12.24, 20:41:21] Amit Wadhawan: For some reason I thought you were doing supps.
[14.12.24, 20:41:46] ~ Steve: Creative variety matters. We've currently got the direct promo/aggressive VSL style nailed. That's my bread and butter all these years but in 2025 I'll be building out a separate side of the ad team. Brand creative. Ad creatives that feel like content and where were actually aren't as concerned on ROAS, and don't mind if ROAS is lower because we're optimizing for awareness, community, brand.
[14.12.24, 20:42:01] ~ Steve: The two sections will be separate but we will share ideas/data between them
[14.12.24, 20:42:03] Amit Wadhawan: We hit some roadblocks trying to ship supps from China so just moving it out to a US 3PL now.
[14.12.24, 20:42:26] ~ Steve: We are. Water soluble nutrition. Functional hydration. Bottles and supps. Full lines coming
[14.12.24, 20:43:58] Amit Wadhawan: Oh ok. We were hitting issues shipping our supps because they got classified as “food products”. Did you face any similar issues?
[14.12.24, 20:44:21] ~ Steve: We've just started selling our first line and we will for sure run into that problem
[14.12.24, 20:44:32] ~ Steve: So we'll push through it as hard as we can.
[14.12.24, 20:44:33] ~ Charles: Smart. Stefan Georgie was talking about that for the next few years how branding will be everything.
[14.12.24, 20:44:46] ~ Steve: Until it's a problem we can't deal with anymore and then we'll make a change.
[14.12.24, 20:44:54] ~ Steve: He's a close friend ;)
[14.12.24, 20:44:56] Amit Wadhawan: Yup. Makes sense!
[14.12.24, 20:45:04] ~ Steve: Have worked with him/for him for years
[14.12.24, 20:45:11] ~ Steve: Wonderful human
[14.12.24, 20:45:40] ~ Charles: Damn! You’ve got a great surrounding as I can see! :)
[14.12.24, 20:45:56] ~ Charles: Yeah he seems to!
[14.12.24, 20:46:11] ~ Steve: Yeah I got started in copywriting about a year after Stefan. He's a great guy if you ever get to meet with him
[14.12.24, 20:46:33] ~ Austin: What do you guys do when low on ads and new launches aren’t working? Keep banging out new ones or hunker down on revisions of previous winners?
[14.12.24, 20:48:40] ~ Charles: I would surely do! Copywriting is literally everything
[14.12.24, 20:49:18] ~ Steve: We keep creating new ads, use the data to inform us on what we should be testing and then also making sure we keep doing new interesting stuff
[14.12.24, 20:49:51] ~ Charles: Currently cranking some Claude advertorials, awesome prompt from him
[14.12.24, 20:50:01] ~ Steve: With this new brand I launched 3 months ago, we didn't have a winning ad creative until our 6th and 7th round of Ads, and then not another winner until our 22nd and 23rd round
[14.12.24, 20:50:34] ~ Steve: But those 4 winners we keep creating new iterations on to keep them cooking, and then always get new fresh stuff in every week, plus healthy mix of static ads
[14.12.24, 20:50:50] ~ Charles: We’re currently on the 10-12th round with no new winners also…
[14.12.24, 20:51:13] ~ Steve: So every week new stuff. We also have a couple advertorials that just crush. Probably need to get new tests there actually lol been a while but if it ain't broke don't fix it
[14.12.24, 20:53:18] ~ Charles: Are you keeping track of your data  with Triples Whales?
[14.12.24, 20:53:42] ~ Steve: No, true profit for now
[14.12.24, 20:53:56] ~ Steve: But as we scale up multiple product lines well probably switch to something better
[14.12.24, 20:54:14] ~ Steve: Right now we basically have 1 product with a new one that just went live. Keeping it simple for now
[14.12.24, 20:54:17] ~ Steve: Early days
[14.12.24, 20:55:09] ~ Charles: Only been 3 months you said?
[14.12.24, 20:55:18] ~ Steve: Motto is don't overcomplicate things. Just scale up, fund new products that no one else can sell, the worry about funnels
[14.12.24, 20:55:28] ~ Charles: New prod after 3 months, things are moving!
[14.12.24, 20:55:29] ~ Steve: Yeah almost 4 now technically since we turned ads on
[14.12.24, 20:56:00] ~ Steve: Well go to china in new year again to see about getting our custom molds done for new product
[14.12.24, 20:56:15] ~ Steve: We had an industrial designer create then entire product line and 3d print it
[14.12.24, 20:56:53] ~ Steve: So now we can see which products to launch first while also getting new supplement formulas 1 at a time. Well enter into electrolytes in Q1. Hugely booming niche
[14.12.24, 20:57:53] ~ Charles: No copycat possible for that one! We did the same with our 2.0
[14.12.24, 20:58:16] ~ Charles: Subscription can be huge on that one!
[14.12.24, 20:58:37] ~ Charles: We’re also looking to enter consumable for Q1
[14.12.24, 21:00:09] ~ Charles: But not in the same sector
[14.12.24, 21:00:57] ~ Bazeed: how much did u spend before being profitable
[14.12.24, 21:01:37] ~ Steve: We were profitable before end of first month, but just slightly
[14.12.24, 21:01:51] ~ Steve: Maybe spent like 15k on ads I dunno I'd have to look
[14.12.24, 21:02:15] ~ Steve: Now we're doing quite well, need to improve margins and efficiency but overall very strong market is trending in our favor
[14.12.24, 21:03:05] ~ Steve: Big Jump in revenue from last month and great way to go into 2025
[14.12.24, 21:03:11] ~ Bazeed: do statics do good for you? statics > advertorials? is that the flow for you
[14.12.24, 21:08:55] ~ Austin: What’s the strategy for revising those winning ads? I’ve had a massive winner and 3 good winners, but when revising the revisions never out performed the original.
[14.12.24, 21:09:21] ~ Andrea: Revise both winners and losers to draw out repetitive patterns
[14.12.24, 21:09:47] ~ Andrea: If the hook for all of the losers is always the same you can make an hypothesis that the problem is the hook and test with a different one
[14.12.24, 21:10:59] ~ Austin: Sounds good, time to fire away
[14.12.24, 22:22:43] ~ Charles: How are you guys launching your test? 

Currently have everything in one CBO and adding some minimum, tried without it aswell. A lot of people told me ABO testing was much better for them… any thought?
[14.12.24, 22:43:03] ~ Alex Lever: Each ad account is different, but most people recommend to have a prospecting CBO and then launch new creatives in packs as new adsets. 

The only downside with this is that it can take a while for Facebook to spend on the new creative. But that’s fine because I’d rather not force the spend in an ABO as you end up wasting budget on ads that don’t work
[15.12.24, 7:00:09] ~ Mithiran: Are you talking about one campaign structure?
[15.12.24, 7:03:38] ~ Mithiran: We tried multiple testing campaigns, every single one of them flopped and wasted a shit ton of money. As soon as we started using one CBO campaign with new ad sets (one ad set for each creative test batch), our hit rate went up to like 50% so far... Before we literally had 0 big winners for 3 months

This is for my ad account at least, its probably different for others
[15.12.24, 7:06:48] ~ Dr Zied: How many adsets? And broad or interest targeting?
[15.12.24, 7:09:02] ~ Mithiran: broad only, 35+ currently have 4 ad sets in there, around 3-4 ads each. Will keep on adding in new tests as they're ready and turn off loser ad sets (or ad sets that dont spend as much after a long time). I dont think there's a limit on the amount of ad sets, as long campaign budget isnt too low...

Got the campaign structure from Nick theriot on youtube
[15.12.24, 11:22:23] ~ Matt: Yh I use the same structure from nick
[15.12.24, 11:22:39] ~ Matt: In his private group too which is good
[15.12.24, 11:27:28] ~ Nick Jansen: Some of our Belgian e-commerce members are using this strategy, and he's been delivering the most consistent results for months.

I’d love to try it myself, but our results with ABO testing and CBO scaling are just too good to mess around with right now! 😄
[15.12.24, 11:57:50] ~ Bazeed: i am using abo for testing as well and its doing good, how do you go about scaling it within a CBO in terms of structure, do you keep 1 adset per 1 winner or?
[15.12.24, 12:01:29] ~ Nick Jansen: CBO ''ever green'' (camp) -> USA (AD SET) -> Winning Ads from ABO (duplicate ad from ABO or via POST ID / AD ID )

So im open for advice :P
[15.12.24, 12:02:24] ~ Nick Jansen: and im just increasing CBO budget based on ROAS and Stock
[15.12.24, 12:02:33] ~ Bazeed: can you pls clarify the adset part
[15.12.24, 12:02:44] ~ Bazeed: do you keep the winners from each batch of creative test in 1 single adset?
[15.12.24, 12:02:49] ~ Bazeed: or 1 adset per winner
[15.12.24, 12:03:43] ~ Nick Jansen: 1 ad set and all winning ads from abo go in the USA ad set, so my CBO only has 1 ad set
[15.12.24, 12:04:42] ~ Bazeed: interesting so whats the point if the budget is going fully into 1 adset, isnt the point of cbo to distribute b/w multiple adsetS?
[15.12.24, 12:06:22] ~ Nick Jansen: The budget from the CBO is allocated to the winning ads based on facebooks algo.
[15.12.24, 12:06:58] ~ Nick Jansen: and in our ABO we are testing all the different hooks/angle/… all that shit one by one
[15.12.24, 12:10:51] ~ Bazeed: oh okay makes sense
[15.12.24, 12:10:58] ~ Bazeed: fair enough ill get a cbo rolling as well
[15.12.24, 12:11:30] ~ Nick Jansen: I launch new CBO campaigns with holiday-specific themes, like Christmas and Black Friday, to ensure my all-time winning ads in the original CBO remain unaffected by the sales of limited-time offers. For example, during Black Friday, I slightly downscale the evergreen campaigns to prioritize the holiday deals while keeping their performance steady.
[15.12.24, 12:13:37] ~ Bazeed: interesting and with the holiday specific cbo, what difference do you make
[15.12.24, 12:13:41] ~ Bazeed: do you change the landing page?
[15.12.24, 12:13:56] ~ Bazeed: because im assuming you cant change the copy or  headlines in the ad itself if youre using post id
[15.12.24, 12:19:10] ~ Nick Jansen: Exactly! For holiday offers, we essentially iterate on our winning campaigns to align with the upcoming holiday. Since we run a 1+1 free offer year-round, there’s no need for major changes to the landing page. We simply make minor tweaks to the ads, such as updating the scripts, scroll-stoppers, and calls-to-action, and then launch them into a new holiday-themed CBO. 😄
[15.12.24, 12:20:23] ~ Bazeed: got it thats nice man
[15.12.24, 12:21:01] ~ Nick Jansen: As soon as we notice fatigue in the holiday-themed CBOs, we start downsizing them and immediately begin scaling up our evergreen CBO again. This ensures a smooth transition and keeps our overall performance consistent

[16.12.24, 9:21:55] ~ Nick Jansen: Facts, we did fiver the first few actors. Cost us around 200$ and we had our footage within 2 days to start testing 😁
[16.12.24, 9:23:09] ~ Bazeed: damn

[16.12.24, 10:06:50] ~ Davide: Also the UGCs on backstage are way more cheaper than Fiver
[16.12.24, 10:23:21] ~ Matt: It takes a while to find good people as there’s loads of crap actors on there
[16.12.24, 10:32:45] ~ Matt: You have to be super specific as well as they aren’t creators like instagram ones so sometimes can appear a bit wooden when talking about a product

I've just got my first warning today via E-mail.
[16.12.24, 16:38:27] ~ Wouter: Hey Guys. We are just building some new brands. How do you find winning niches or products?
[16.12.24, 16:38:34] ~ Wouter: Not short term but long term
[16.12.24, 16:39:32] ~ Andrea: You could go for the evergreen niches like skincare, supplements, pain reduction, sleep aid, etc
[16.12.24, 16:39:51] ~ Andrea: These always work you just need good marketing
[16.12.24, 16:47:15] ~ Matt: What niche are you selling ?
[16.12.24, 16:47:28] ~ Caesar: Pain relief
[16.12.24, 16:48:03] ~ Matt: Anyone have any idea how long it takes to warm up a brand new ad account? From experience I would say around 3 months depending on spend levels
[16.12.24, 16:48:40] ~ Matt: I’m in supps joint pain so wondering if I will get hit too
[16.12.24, 16:49:02] ~ Matt: Although for pets which might help avoid it
[16.12.24, 16:49:05] ~ Caesar: Probably
[16.12.24, 16:49:17] ~ Caesar: Its about not mentioning specific conditions
[16.12.24, 16:49:20] ~ Caesar: Pain relief is fine
[16.12.24, 16:58:10] ~ Wouter: Yeah thanks but how do you find them
[16.12.24, 17:08:58] ~ Bazeed: spy using spy tools and cross reference with ads library to check active ads

check traffic using similar web, brands over 200-300k monthly traffic are doing good.

then choose the offer that suits your unit economics the best

[16.12.24, 18:38:19] ~ Caesar: idk what it even means (regarding pixel thing), we are still running purchase ads, still getting sales every minute as per usual ‎<This message was edited>
[16.12.24, 18:40:28] ~ Mithiran: i think it goes active in jan if im not mistaken
[16.12.24, 19:15:45] ~ Matt: Interesting, Yh I reckon some fake likes I bought has flagged my acc for sure in that case
[16.12.24, 19:16:23] ~ Robert: Never bought any likes so I can't comment on that.
[16.12.24, 19:16:50] ~ Matt: I wonder if these restrictions will apply if customers mentioning the specific condition in their reviews…
[16.12.24, 19:26:08] ~ Caesar: Guys how many ads inside one ad set would you say is maximum?

We have tested up to 30 ads inside one ad sets, and indeed its not enough to properly spend on all, but FB finds the "winner" fast, so it does work anyway.

What do you recommend? I've tried both 5-7 per ad set, and 15-30 per ad set, no big difference really.
[16.12.24, 19:27:06] ~ Christopher Murphy: Facebook recommends no more than 5
[16.12.24, 19:27:56] ~ Mithiran: We always keep maximum of 6 ads. Any more than that, apparently facebook won't be able to optimize correctly.

30 ads is crazy haha (but could work idk)

On average its usually 4-5 ads
[16.12.24, 19:28:20] ~ Mithiran: is that a regular campaign ad set or ASC?
[16.12.24, 19:29:33] ~ Matt: I heard ASC thrives on having a ton of ads and a good mixture in 1
[16.12.24, 19:29:59] ~ Caesar: yeah, this is my approach to this game, hear out all the pros, but then just test random (usually really crazy) stuff by myself as well, so I can see both sides if that makes sense, sure I'll lose money but hey that's the sacrifice!
[16.12.24, 19:31:09] ~ Caesar: Just a normal campaign ad set in a CBO.

We actually don't use ASC at all, I've never tried it yet, we still do 6k a day on bad days and 10k a day on good days currently, ill try it eventually.

Atm im just hurrying to use and abuse FB fast before they ban health niche conditions:/
[16.12.24, 19:32:57] ~ Matt: Do you think mentioning things like ‘inflammation’ will be ok as it could be perceived as a medical condition?
‎[16.12.24, 19:33:16] ~ Caesar: ‎image omitted
[16.12.24, 19:33:32] ~ Caesar: These are the events FB has blocked under my pixel for health niche violation.

We cant run viewcontent or pageview at all.
[16.12.24, 19:34:01] ~ Caesar: So if the January thing is for real, and they ban purchase, then I guess you cant run ads at all for health niche...? I'm just guessin don't take my word for it though ^^
[16.12.24, 19:34:04] ~ Bazeed: thats strange, so how are you going to send the traffic
[16.12.24, 19:34:20] ~ Caesar: Yeah, good question, no idea...
[16.12.24, 19:34:33] ~ Bazeed: this is prob a rare case, thats impossible the will ban all health ads
[16.12.24, 19:34:42] ~ Bazeed: theres millions of their rev coming from health
[16.12.24, 19:34:50] ~ Bazeed: $$$mark cant let that happen
[16.12.24, 19:35:01] ~ Caesar: A guy did an amazing video on this on YT, condition refers to something like arthritis or neuropathy or cervical spondylosis. 

Whereas symptoms such as pain, swelling, etc, are not considered a condition, but a symptom, get what I mean?
[16.12.24, 19:35:42] ~ Caesar: man ive heard ppl say that again and again for weeks now, but somehow i doubt this will trump their court fees with all the cases they are fighting regarding HIPPO or whatever it's called, HIPPA, something like that, regarding privacy of conditions:/
[16.12.24, 19:35:54] ~ Caesar: im prayin too bossman 🙏
[16.12.24, 19:36:43] ~ Bazeed: yep we will have to weave our way through and just replace the wording, i dont think its much of a hassle.

for example for neuropathy brnsds can no longer target the word neuropathy straight up but using wording has numbness, tingling or burning sensation would make sense.

thats what i think is the way around
[16.12.24, 19:37:29] ~ Caesar: yep, and then also change all the words in the ads too, which is annoying, we have so many good ads we can run forever but will need to change them all

This page was created few years back and only 2 days ago changed the name using ours + posted all the same content we had on FB.

How can I discover who is the owner of this page? Someone is playing dirty here... Also, for some reason I can't see the country where the people that are managing the page are from

[17.12.24, 23:47:14] ~ Carlos Ribeiro: thank you! seems like a gem really low views
[17.12.24, 23:47:49] ~ Andrea: No problem :)

[18.12.24, 0:12:22] ~ Carlos Ribeiro: is there any like ads library for funnels? where you can see other guys funnels?
[18.12.24, 0:13:42] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: probably try this 
on fb ads library search "/pages/" then u will see all ads using page builder then u can find some really good ones amongst them
[18.12.24, 0:14:41] ~ Carlos Ribeiro: hmm that's an interesting tip, i have tried /advertorial and manage to see some but not much
[18.12.24, 0:14:43] ~ Carlos Ribeiro: thank you
[18.12.24, 0:18:05] ~ Andrea: funnel of the week is the closest you'll get to that because to see entire funnels you need to go through the purchase flow

[18.12.24, 5:02:00] ~ Mason Schulze: Guys, could someone please give me thoughts and advice? It would be much appreciated - 

We have created 2 x new shopify stores (duplicates) of our original English written store, but now one for Germany and one for south America fully translated in German and Spanish, we also have 2 x separate facebook ad accounts to run the ads for both of these. What I'm not sure about is if we should use the same seasoned pixle from the original store or start 2 x new pixles for both of the new stores? Thanks legends
[18.12.24, 8:33:38] ~ Omar Tayara: Hey Bro, so i had the same question a few months ago while i was taking nick theriot’s mentorship program and what he recommended is diff shopify stores, same pixel, same ads manager.
[18.12.24, 8:45:38] ~ Mason Schulze: thanks bro, yeh its a tough one because for me its a different demographic of people and different language so im thinking using the same pixel would only confuse it
[18.12.24, 9:12:48] ~ Omar Tayara: Here they gave the study of a fashion brand called icon amsterdam and they also had a german and US website/shopify so it should work fine. At the end the pixel tracks user behavior and shouldn’t be affected by a change in languages
[18.12.24, 9:29:45] ~ Mason Schulze: true! thanks for this bro
[18.12.24, 9:29:56] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Lovro Knavs⁩ ☝
[18.12.24, 9:34:31] ~ Ignasi: GOAT
[18.12.24, 9:37:26] ~ Mason Schulze: guys whats the best to use for a new landing page / funnel with upsells - Clickfunnels, funnelish?
[18.12.24, 9:39:03] Topi: mostly used are funnelish and checkoutchamp i think @⁨~Mason Schulze⁩
[18.12.24, 9:39:07] Topi: checkoutchamp can easily get quite complex
[18.12.24, 9:39:30] ~ Andrea: Checkoutchamp is great when funnelish bottlenecks you
[18.12.24, 9:39:40] ~ Andrea: When you need more customization than what funnelish offers
[18.12.24, 9:39:58] ~ Andrea: But that happens way down the line, I don't recommend c.c. as a starter, it's gonna be really hard
[18.12.24, 9:44:02] ~ Mason Schulze: i have a design ready for a three page funnel, landing page, offerpage, checkout page and just cant decide where to develop it because ive always just used shopify
[18.12.24, 9:44:54] ~ Mason Schulze: but also i don't know how my supplier would connect to something like funnelish to fulfill the orders
[18.12.24, 9:45:01] ~ Andrea: Yeah I recommend funnelish, it's easy and not much can go wrong
[18.12.24, 9:45:14] ~ Andrea: Funnelish is the frontend and Shopify is the backend
[18.12.24, 9:46:02] ~ Mason Schulze: so that would mean i can still use shopify payements, afterpay etc
[18.12.24, 9:46:32] ~ Andrea: No the payment happens on funnelish then the orders get exported to Shopify
[18.12.24, 9:48:19] ~ Mason Schulze: so i would need to setup new stripe account etc?
[18.12.24, 9:49:18] ~ Andrea: Idk about new, but yeah you connect stripe/PayPal or other payment methods are you prefer like nmi payarc etc
[18.12.24, 9:52:03] ~ Mason Schulze: ok thanks for the help @⁨~Andrea⁩ @⁨Topi⁩
[18.12.24, 9:53:18] ~ Davide: Yo guys, Have any of you ever set up a custom payment gateway or worked with your own Merchant ID (MID) instead of just using Shopify Payments, Stripe, or PayPal?
I’m currently facing an issue with a lot of declined transactions in the US market, and since I’m using Revolut as bank, I suspect my bank being European might be causing issues with US issued cards.
[18.12.24, 10:35:16] ~ Matt: Yh this is really good
[18.12.24, 16:04:07] ~ Matt: For anyone doing comments on ads how many do you think is necessary and do you do it on all new assets you launch?

[18.12.24, 16:23:59] ~ Matt: Service providers handle this

[19.12.24, 3:24:16] ~ Parker Godfrey: Looking for some advice here... I consolidated my account into a single CBO campaign, launched it with a $1,800/day budget, and noticed all the spend going to one ad set. My blended ROAS jumped by about 20% overnight, which was great. My target ROAS is 1.7. For the first three days, it performed solidly, but over the next few days, it started fluctuating, and by day seven, the ad set dropped to a 1.41 ROAS.

What’s your approach when one ad set is slightly underperforming but eating up most of the budget? I’ve got about six other ad sets running alongside it.
[19.12.24, 3:31:01] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey bro, this would require using a separate BM and Page to connect the Facebook Sales channel and pixel to the separate store right? Because you can only have one page and BM connected per shopify store.
[19.12.24, 3:36:03] ~ Guy Edan: Did anyone ever get flagged by FB and got insane CPMs? 
We are getting $300-700 no matter what ad we do for a new brand and out of ideas how to solve it
[19.12.24, 3:36:40] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: If the adset is negatively impacting the campaign, you should try turning it off and see how the campaign performs
[19.12.24, 3:40:51] ~ Parker Godfrey: So to follow up, I did that and it stopped spending for the rest of the day. The next day it started spending on a new adset at a 1.7. So I wanted to test what would happen if i turned back on the first adset and it spent $500 in one hour...
[19.12.24, 3:43:15] ~ Erne: @⁨~Parker Godfrey⁩ Trust the machine learning, if facebook keep spending on that one, means that is the best one. Your only goal should be keep testing new creatives until you gonna find a new one that sucks up all the spent. How many ads you launch on a weekly basis? ‎<This message was edited>
[19.12.24, 3:51:59] ~ Parker Godfrey: Gotcha! About 3-5 concepts with 4 variations each. So 15-20 ads
[19.12.24, 3:53:54] ~ Parker Godfrey: My past viral organic videos suck all the spend and my higher quality ads with my editor don’t get spend
[19.12.24, 3:54:12] ~ Erne: Also not all ads are scalable in the same way imo. Depends on the awareness stage your ads is targeting, the more aware is, the less scalable it’s gonna be cuz your Audience is gonna be smaller.
[19.12.24, 3:55:48] ~ Erne: More aware ads are easier to crack compared to less aware stages, things is that when you gonna create a banger ads targeting an unaware pool of people is most likely that’s gonna print for longer time
[19.12.24, 3:56:09] ~ Erne: Study your viral ads
[19.12.24, 3:56:31] ~ Erne: The desire behind, the awareness stage, the persona, the avatar on it
[19.12.24, 3:56:49] ~ Erne: And iterate it with your video editor
[19.12.24, 3:57:49] ~ Parker Godfrey: You nailed it! My viral vids are super broad targeting an insecurity hence why it went viral. Broad messaging
[19.12.24, 3:57:54] ~ Erne: There’s a reason why that ads is sucking up all the spend, you do need to understand why
[19.12.24, 3:58:07] ~ Erne: When you understand why
[19.12.24, 3:58:15] ~ Erne: You gonna start print 💸
[19.12.24, 3:59:29] ~ Parker Godfrey: And when making variations, should it be almost exact? With maybe one small aspect changed?
[19.12.24, 4:00:18] ~ Erne: I would focus on things they can have bigger impact compared to change the color of the text in the hook lol
[19.12.24, 4:00:35] ~ Erne: The messaging, the environment etc ‎<This message was edited>
[19.12.24, 4:00:56] ~ Erne: But keeping the same ad concept, same desire etc
[19.12.24, 4:02:13] ~ Parker Godfrey: Okay sweet! Thank you man
[19.12.24, 4:02:28] ~ Erne: Anytime man
[19.12.24, 7:23:32] ~ Parker Godfrey: Has anyone had issues with copyrighted music in Ads? Using well known songs crushes but I got hit with a cease n desist from Universal Music about a year and a half ago and they scared the shit outta me. But i see some big brands using drake songs all the time for example…
[19.12.24, 8:38:42] ~ Filippo: Anyone have insider for fb unbans? ‎<This message was edited>

[19.12.24, 9:14:53] ~ Mithiran: Ryze Superfoods they sell mushroom coffee
[19.12.24, 9:15:47] ~ Ry: anyone has recommendations for tiktok shop? for non US entity
[19.12.24, 9:15:52] ~ Matt: Cheers I’ll follow them on atria
[19.12.24, 9:17:13] ~ Mithiran: We use adspy, you can see their top spending ads by likes im not sure if other platforms can do that
[19.12.24, 9:34:54] ~ Matt: That’s interesting, atria only has longest running ads and active / non active filters
[19.12.24, 9:35:12] ~ Matt: But let’s you download the script of any ad which is useful for inspiring
[19.12.24, 13:47:04] ~ Omar: How you guys currently split testing leads?

How many sentences from the start are you changing ?
[19.12.24, 13:47:43] Topi: Its not about counting sentences. Lead should be its own gongruent story that attaches on body creative
[19.12.24, 13:47:51] Topi: lead can be 3 sentences or 30
[19.12.24, 13:48:16] ~ Omar: how many leads u test on ur winners weekly?
[19.12.24, 13:48:30] Topi: Swipe lead ideas from: competitors, youtube, winning advertorials, news articles (just news sites)
[19.12.24, 13:49:27] Topi: Not sure anymore as im not so much involved anymore in our creatives, we used to test at least 10 per winner and if high hit rate, keep testing more
[19.12.24, 15:34:14] ~ Arad Khazabi: is it supposed to take so long? still ongoing
[19.12.24, 16:09:51] ~ Davide: I think 1 day max
[19.12.24, 16:19:13] ~ Bazeed: anybody has some basic ecom courses? im trying to get my brother whos stuck in a 9-5 to learn something lol. figured the advanced copywriting courses wont be very easy to comprehend as a beginner.
[19.12.24, 16:24:26] ~ Nick Jansen: David fogarty has a 3hour long all in video on YouTube 😂 that was the first video I ever watched 😂

[19.12.24, 16:26:46] ~ N: Nah I mean Gabriel was legend

[19.12.24, 16:27:11] ~ N: That take a winner and run in EU guy
[19.12.24, 16:27:32] ~ Arad Khazabi: that guy aint making money, just some guru needing money with course, I know him
[19.12.24, 16:28:12] ~ A: @⁨~Mark⁩ @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ do u have a separate WhatsApp group for ppl doing $1m+/month
[19.12.24, 16:28:17] ~ Steve: Agreeee omfg
[19.12.24, 16:29:25] ~ Steve: Like bro if you have to show your new watch in every picture you take on Twitter you are so cringe I can't even watch you. It's brutal that guy stinks. He's a low level Fedotoff wannabe with a quarter of the experience and results
[19.12.24, 16:31:05] ~ Arad Khazabi: not even quarter bro
[19.12.24, 16:31:20] ~ Arad Khazabi: he looks like a fake ecom guru that doesnt make money
[19.12.24, 16:34:08] ~ NeuroCup: what happened to him? one of the only guys that actually delivered five years ago
[19.12.24, 16:34:19] ~ NeuroCup: but he just vanished

[19.12.24, 19:04:11] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys I'm getting requested by CAP & ASA (United Kingdom Advertising Authority) to turn off our ads because they're non compliant and are advertising for a health condition.

They said that they'll request Facebook to remove the non-complaint ads.

Has anyone went thru this before? Will facebook even listen to them and remove the ads?
[19.12.24, 19:04:18] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone here selling elder women skincare products and can share their avg CPMs?
[19.12.24, 19:07:43] ~ Matt: $52 over last 30 days so not great at the moment.
[19.12.24, 19:15:36] ~ Guy Edan: Thank you
[19.12.24, 19:38:04] ~ Nick Jansen: Somebody having the worst focking day of December in sales today? 😱

We went from decent profits back to back to ROAS 1 today 🤦🏻‍♂️

FOCKING CRAZY
[19.12.24, 19:41:23] ~ Phil: ‎~ Lucio Martinez added ~ Phil
[19.12.24, 19:53:01] ~ Mikael: Yes. Had same last year. Sales died for 1 week around christmas. Both brands
[19.12.24, 19:53:40] ~ Nick Jansen: advice? downscale everything?
[19.12.24, 19:54:51] ~ Phil: Hey guys, I copped the dreaded 100% hold from Shopify. Chargeback rate is above 3%. Yeah I know it’s really high but if anyone has had success removing it before the due date please let me know. 

Thanks Phil 🙏
[19.12.24, 19:56:43] ~ Mikael: Yeah I dont have any good solution for this. We just look closely at the market and downscale gradually
[19.12.24, 19:57:03] ~ Nick Jansen: It's our first year doing $100k+ months , so I'm a bit nervous about what to do next without losing momentum. :P
[19.12.24, 19:57:13] ~ Nick Jansen: roger that, thanks :D
[19.12.24, 19:58:21] ~ Mikael: Congratz 👍🙏🚀 I dont actually know how to prevent this. Last year it started selling good from 1st-3rd of jan again
[19.12.24, 19:59:12] ~ Nick Jansen: im waiting for 1st jan to launch our valentine gifting sales :P so im going to downscale bit by bit and see what happens
[19.12.24, 19:59:16] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Only way is to lower it. Use the chargeback alerts from disputifier so you refund before the chargeback hits the account. This way you will lower the chargeback rate
[19.12.24, 20:18:31] ~ Phil: Yeah I have that but because all of our money is on hold we havnt ran on that store anymore
[19.12.24, 20:18:57] ~ Phil: And if we add another payment processor it won’t be Shopify payments so I don’t think the dispute rate will go down will it?
[19.12.24, 20:19:09] ~ Phil: Even with more transactions
[19.12.24, 20:20:13] ~ Alvaro De Prada: That’s “worse” unfortunately. They have you on a headlock. If you stop runninng Shopify payments, the hold will last its maximum. But if you keep running Shopify payments, the hold will be huge and you won’t have the cashflow
[19.12.24, 20:20:35] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If I were you, I’d use a different processor and just get the big payout in the future
[19.12.24, 20:20:35] ~ Phil: Yeah see it’s a shit situation
[19.12.24, 20:20:50] ~ Phil: Yeah I might have to do that
[19.12.24, 20:20:57] ~ Phil: It’s just everyday we loosing more and more money
[19.12.24, 20:21:06] ~ Phil: In 1 month over 50k down in returns and chargebacks
[19.12.24, 20:21:39] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Is it bc the product is shit?
[19.12.24, 20:21:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Late deliveries?
[19.12.24, 20:22:02] ~ Phil: Guys and girls, learn from my mistake. If you are selling clothing do not scale until you do proper quality checks with your supplier
[19.12.24, 20:22:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Oh… fashion… yeah that’s normal. Specially from China
[19.12.24, 20:22:29] ~ Phil: Old supplier issues not delivery hundreds of orders even when I payed, Quality issues, Canada post strike
[19.12.24, 20:22:34] ~ Phil: Literally everything
[19.12.24, 20:23:07] ~ Phil: My own fault but still annoying
[19.12.24, 20:23:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: That’s the main reason I stopped doing fashion. Easy cash in but it bites you in the ass later on unless you are not prepared
[19.12.24, 20:23:39] ~ Phil: Yeha exactly
[19.12.24, 20:23:50] ~ Phil: Appreciate the help @⁨~Alvaro De Prada⁩ 🙏
[19.12.24, 20:25:05] ~ Alvaro De Prada: No problem. Just keep pushing and find a way out. 100% you will

[20.12.24, 22:58:18] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you guys like splitting up your CBOs based on country or having a batch of countries in each
[20.12.24, 23:00:14] ~ Charles: I have everything in one CBO
[20.12.24, 23:00:32] ~ Charles: will test an adv soon and create a new one for that
[20.12.24, 23:01:13] ~ Yusuf: putting all countries together
[20.12.24, 23:06:05] ~ Kyle Twohill: what if some countries waste budget, just let fb optimize, for example lets say I have 15 countries and 5 are performing very good, 10 bad no point in separating the 5 good each in their own
[20.12.24, 23:07:30] ~ Bazeed: is it worth for you guys doing multiple countries rather than 1? 

does most rev comes 1 major country? if yes whats the reason to be doing multiple rather than something like only us
[20.12.24, 23:13:54] ~ Yusuf: fb automatically spends less on others and you're still profitable from others too, bigger audience means more room to scale
[20.12.24, 23:14:43] ~ Yusuf: usually if it's unprofitable fb doesn't spend too much so i don't mind but good to check time to time profitability of countries and in your new campaigns, you can publish with the profitable ones
[20.12.24, 23:15:52] ~ Yusuf: also might be interesting but for me us usually performs better when i target multiple countries compared to targeting only us
[20.12.24, 23:25:40] ~ Bazeed: what app do you use in shopify for currency and country change
[20.12.24, 23:26:00] ~ Bazeed: that detects the location accurately @⁨~Yusuf⁩
[20.12.24, 23:29:05] ~ Yusuf: for my bigger brand i just use usd as currency both for product pages and checkout and conversion rate is decent
- when i use shopify native conversion checkout, cr increased but it was not worth it for 2% extra transactional cost when i calculated
- ⁠having 3-3.5% cr for 125 usd aov

for smaller brand i show local currency but cr is worse, so planning to test usd as only currency there too

[21.12.24, 8:34:15] ~ Aaron Ware: Anyone else running shop ads?
[21.12.24, 8:34:42] ~ Twizzylit: How’s it working
[21.12.24, 8:35:08] ~ Aaron Ware: Well it’s actually crazy you only pay when you get a conversion.
[21.12.24, 8:35:14] ~ Aaron Ware: You set the CAC
[21.12.24, 8:35:31] ~ Aaron Ware: Imagine you could do that on meta 😝
[21.12.24, 8:35:51] ~ Twizzylit: Are you putting high budgets then putting like 30% margin CAC ?
[21.12.24, 8:36:02] ~ Aaron Ware: Yep
[21.12.24, 8:36:07] ~ Aaron Ware: Just started it yesterday
[21.12.24, 8:36:19] ~ Twizzylit: How high can you set the budget.
[21.12.24, 8:36:54] ~ Parker Godfrey: Does it spend at high budget?
[21.12.24, 8:37:28] ~ Aaron Ware: My max is 44k
[21.12.24, 8:37:38] ~ Aaron Ware: Not sure if it’s different for everyone
[21.12.24, 8:38:31] ~ Twizzylit: Shit I could test on my supp brand
[21.12.24, 8:38:41] ~ Twizzylit: Spending 12k on Facebook
[21.12.24, 8:40:56] ~ Aaron Ware: Yeah man give it a crack. You literally click 3 buttons. It’s nuts.
[21.12.24, 8:41:19] ~ Twizzylit: Before running ads did you build out a shop pay page ?
[21.12.24, 8:41:49] ~ Parker Godfrey: what was your starting budget on the test?
[21.12.24, 8:42:06] ~ Aaron Ware: Nope. That’s next! Thought I would see if it’s worth it first.
[21.12.24, 8:42:40] ~ Aaron Ware: $5k
[21.12.24, 8:43:29] ~ Parker Godfrey: So it’s not spending through much budget? Just trying to see if you think it’s scalable
[21.12.24, 8:44:12] ~ Aaron Ware: That’s right. Barely spending.  But haven’t played with cac %
[21.12.24, 8:44:53] ~ Parker Godfrey: Gotcha. Did you use the suggested or pull CAC down further?
[21.12.24, 8:45:29] ~ Aaron Ware: Pulled it down
[21.12.24, 9:08:31] ~ Mithiran: Anyone have a cheaper alternative for facebook ads pixel tracking + Profit tracking other than triple whale?

Im tired of paying 400 USD a month
[21.12.24, 9:40:52] ~ Twizzylit: Bruh it’s only $400
[21.12.24, 9:42:27] ~ RS: I use wetracked for tracking and trueprofit for profit/loss
[21.12.24, 10:15:36] ~ Davide: Me too
[21.12.24, 10:32:47] ~ Gideon: Lebesgue for profit tracking. Pixel os set up with a guy who has a fix. A special app. I could hel you to get in contact with him
[21.12.24, 11:02:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For people managing multiple stores and want to track everything simultaneously, Polar Analytics is a great option. Fully customizable
[21.12.24, 11:02:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Profit/loss tracking *
[21.12.24, 13:50:47] ~ Yusuf: targeting worldwide and excluding cheap countries such as india, pakistan, africa (continent), south america (continent), etc

[21.12.24, 14:48:23] ~ NeuroCup: 35x ROAS in one campaign today
[21.12.24, 14:48:27] ~ NeuroCup: absolutely insane
[21.12.24, 14:48:37] ~ NeuroCup: but it’s low budged
[21.12.24, 14:53:42] ~ Phil: Yes ofc
[21.12.24, 14:53:55] ~ Phil: There is really no right and wrongs with how you scale/bump etc
[21.12.24, 14:53:59] ~ Phil: It’s whatever works for you
[21.12.24, 14:54:09] ~ Phil: Watch your CPC and ROAS that’s it
[21.12.24, 14:54:19] ~ Phil: Every 1-2 hours double
[21.12.24, 14:56:13] ~ NeuroCup: I just doubled on one adset, let’s see how it performs
[21.12.24, 14:56:58] ~ NeuroCup: any experience with more than doubling? like 5x or 10x right of the gate?
‎[21.12.24, 15:10:26] ~ Arad Khazabi: ‎image omitted

[21.12.24, 17:00:02] ~ Austin: Never had it personally
[21.12.24, 17:02:27] ~ Austin: You guys are doubling ad set budgets every hour? Does that not throw it back to learning phase?
[21.12.24, 18:36:53] ~ Austin: Could someone send me an Advertorial swipe file?
[21.12.24, 18:40:25] ~ LC: If anyone has any good creative editors, DM me please
[21.12.24, 18:40:54] ~ Austin: Hire on Onlinejobs.ph I've had great hires from there
[21.12.24, 18:41:19] ~ LC: cheers mate will have a look
[21.12.24, 20:21:24] ~ Steve: guys I am looking for a graphic designer an page builder in one person. Someone who can:
- Design in Figma
- ⁠Build the page in Replo/Pagefly/Checkout champ
- ⁠Has decent design skills
- ⁠Can edit images
- ⁠Can mock up advertorials

Asking too much? Does anyone have such a person?
[21.12.24, 20:22:17] ~ Steve: I am just getting tired of having things look beautiful in figma and then the developer we have just can’t execute because he has 0 design skills. Spacing is off, sizing is off, multiple different fonts, colors off - every time. And then I spend hours fine tuning the details on pages
[21.12.24, 20:22:25] ~ Steve: so we’re letting him go to find someone ele
[21.12.24, 20:22:38] ~ Steve: open to any referrals and willing to pay the person accordingly
[21.12.24, 20:25:57] ~ NeuroCup: I already 10x the budged from this morning. Of course the roas lowered, but like 20%

Post from few days ago
[21.12.24, 21:02:18] ~ Jonny: Send me a DM. I have someone who is very good. Works with replo too and checkout champ.
Not cheap, not super expensive either. But you get what you pay for I guess
[21.12.24, 21:35:22] ~ Austin: What is to your guys see the highest profitability return on? Been testing offers and Advertorials often but no major changes, what’s other suggestions?
[21.12.24, 21:47:46] ~ Carlos Ribeiro: I had a bad experience surfing it seemed that fucked my ad account, it never performed the same, I had to user others after that but maybe that was only me
[21.12.24, 21:49:31] ~ NeuroCup: how long have you done it?
[21.12.24, 21:55:55] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: what is a good average play time for a creative in supp niche in usa, also any tips for analysing creative metrics guys?
[21.12.24, 21:58:56] ~ Austin: Look at your hook and play through rate 50/25 75/50 95/75 and see where drop off is and revise from there these metrics can be set up as custom FB columns
[21.12.24, 21:59:08] ~ Austin: HK’s are biggest lever from my experience
[21.12.24, 22:15:12] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yes I see, my hook rate is 60-70% on all creatives but average play time for the 33 sec video is 10 secs so i think i gotta improve it someway, creatives got rejected so just have 2 active. Offer is 29.99 + 2.99 shipping, I'm getting abandoned checkouts lot so I think imma change it to free ship and increase a bit upfront
[21.12.24, 22:18:38] ~ M A N U E L: Hey guys, any good ad account agency you can recommend? Possibly that is active on weekends too… We got out ad account disabled and our agency on weekends is not active (seems crazy to me tbh)
[21.12.24, 23:21:09] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Hey guys, I'm having a lot of fun  building some apps via AI and would love to hear what you hate doing and would love to automate via AI. Just need some ideas I can play with and maybe help you guys out for free
[21.12.24, 23:59:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Which one are you using currently
[22.12.24, 0:55:17] ~ Twizzylit: For hook rate don’t really look at it
[22.12.24, 1:00:40] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah u r right that's what I feel like, it's easier to achieve, I feel it's more important to see the play through
[22.12.24, 1:36:42] ~ Imran: Hey guys, you know any good agencies that offer CC ad accounts?
[22.12.24, 1:37:40] ~ Growg: Please DM
[22.12.24, 1:52:38] ~ Nebil: I see one of my brands on there that I exited “Sockalign” the advertorial you listed did 40% margins when I launched back in 2022
[22.12.24, 1:54:13] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: No way bro that's great to hear, how much did you exited for?
[22.12.24, 2:23:16] ~ Arad Khazabi: Anybody is also not able to get payments done on fivver? I’m keep getting errors and it’s not going through, no matter the payment method
[22.12.24, 2:33:06] ~ Mason Schulze: Checkout champ or funnelish? What's better, and why everyone. Thanks
[22.12.24, 2:34:18] ~ Andrea: Checkoutchamp has a lot more possibilities and you can do stuff that is impossible on funnelish, but it's also 10x harder to use and most of the time you'll need a dev team
[22.12.24, 2:34:39] ~ Andrea: It also costs a LOT more since it's 1% rev+ $300 fixed monthly I think?
[22.12.24, 2:35:16] ~ Andrea: I would say start on funnelish and move to cc when funnelish bottlenecks you
[22.12.24, 2:43:07] ~ Mason Schulze: Ok thanks @⁨~Andrea⁩
[22.12.24, 3:57:45] ~ Nebil: It was low 6 figs and 0.3 multiple we were trying to get rid of the brand as quick as possible since we had other brands we were working on

[22.12.24, 5:16:29] ~ Nebil: Lifetime profit

[22.12.24, 9:29:42] ~ ...: Can anyone hook me up with someone who is doing unhold for Paypal and stripe?
[22.12.24, 9:31:28] Topi: Yes dm
[22.12.24, 9:47:47] ~ Mert M: hello, Is there anyone outside the usa in here who is payment process with usa company?

[22.12.24, 13:00:49] ~ Hylke: Sometimes it helps to remove and add cc again
[22.12.24, 15:09:35] ~ Malik: Quick question for the guys running brands for several years, how is Q1 looking in general for you ? I started my brand in Feb this year and it was a great month, march too. I'm planning lots of testing for January and I'd like your take on that. Thx
[22.12.24, 15:21:41] ~ Matt: Depends on product, wellness does very well in Jan
[22.12.24, 20:02:08] ~ Andrej: If you can tie the product to New Year’s resolutions it will rip
[22.12.24, 22:53:38] ~ Arad Khazabi: **hey guys, is there anyway to message a upwork person through this page?:**

[23.12.24, 4:50:15] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey legends, how do most of you handle customer service. I have 4 VAs working on emails through upwork and, in my opinion, is costing way too much for Philippines workers. I receive probley around 50- 100 emails per day
[23.12.24, 4:51:16] ~ Steve: We hired 1 guy in eastern Europe we trust. Has sales experience. Handles calls and emails and saves sales over the phone. Has made some sales too
[23.12.24, 4:51:26] ~ Steve: As we scale up well hire juniors to report to him
[23.12.24, 4:51:52] ~ Steve: Probably by mid 2025 we'll be big enough and well hire a call center in the US, and they will handle out bound as well
[23.12.24, 4:53:13] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Steve⁩ do you get many emails from customers to attend too?
[23.12.24, 4:53:43] ~ Steve: Not yet, as we scale up supplements we will.
[23.12.24, 4:53:48] ~ Mason Schulze: I wish I could have 1 just handle everything but would be impossible unless they never leave the computer
[23.12.24, 4:53:55] ~ Steve: But decent amount. 15-20 per day
[23.12.24, 4:54:42] ~ Mason Schulze: I'm trying to find a software that can just reply with AI to all the emails
[23.12.24, 4:54:46] ~ Steve: Calls I don't even know, he's been crushing it. Offloaded to him completely.
[23.12.24, 4:55:12] ~ Mason Schulze: Does he cost you much?
[23.12.24, 4:57:39] ~ Steve: For us no, it's worth it. We just increased him starting for January as he's now very worth it in terms of ROI, plus I don't have to deal with CS at all, such a blessing
[23.12.24, 4:58:02] ~ Steve: I'd say him and our media buyer are our highest ROI members of the team for sure, they've been game changes
[23.12.24, 4:58:14] ~ Steve: Lead video editor behind them also been very good ROI
[23.12.24, 4:58:59] ~ Mason Schulze: Do you use upwork to manage him?
[23.12.24, 5:00:07] ~ Steve: No, he's fully on our team. I do not hire from Upwork or fiver outside of small small 1 time jobs
[23.12.24, 5:00:34] ~ Steve: If the person is on fiver or upwotk and they are good then I'll get them off there and on our team as soon as I can but that's rare
[23.12.24, 5:00:50] ~ Steve: I also source work from Twitter a lot. Untapped in my opinion
[23.12.24, 5:01:11] ~ Nebil: How are you finding quality editors that don’t charge $100 an hour?
[23.12.24, 5:01:15] ~ Nebil: It’s been a pain
[23.12.24, 5:01:28] ~ Nebil: I’m relying on one editor but I feel like I have all of my eggs in one basket ‎<This message was edited>
[23.12.24, 5:01:34] ~ Steve: Like the other day I needed a design job done. Searched Twitter for large accounts who have posted "looking for designer post your portfolio in comments" and then I'll go through the comments and pluck someone from there lol
[23.12.24, 5:01:36] ~ Steve: Super easy
[23.12.24, 5:02:00] ~ Steve: My network, twitter, referrals
[23.12.24, 5:02:22] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh i have all my CS team and editors on upwork, and the bills are fkn massive all the time
[23.12.24, 5:02:44] ~ Mason Schulze: Thinking to move them all of there as I'm sure upwork is adding on extra
[23.12.24, 5:03:11] ~ Steve: That's wild. Why pay Upwork the fees? Get them off their if you can, pay them direct
[23.12.24, 5:03:17] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh 100
[23.12.24, 5:04:16] ~ Steve: $100 an hour for an editor is kind of a lot too. We found a good one through referral, did 2 rounds of video editing projects and then moved him to monthly retainer
[23.12.24, 5:05:02] ~ Steve: Gave him what he asked for, and throw as much work at him as possible. Very happy guy. Just fronted him a months salary so he could buy new laptop etc. stuff like that buys you loyalty
[23.12.24, 5:05:33] ~ Nebil: I currently pay my editor around $60 an hour but he’s worth it, I have another editor for reiterations that’s super cheap but I can’t rely on him to make good creatives unless I guide him through every part. I have seen some insane prices for other competent editors
[23.12.24, 5:06:07] ~ Nebil: How much per video are you paying him based on the retainer?
[23.12.24, 5:07:03] ~ Steve: I'd have to do the math but like $20 a video 😂
[23.12.24, 5:07:17] ~ Nebil: That’s super cheap
[23.12.24, 5:07:26] ~ Nebil: Especially if he’s able to work independently
[23.12.24, 5:08:07] ~ Steve: - $1200/mo
- 5-7 VSL scripts (1-3 minutes long) per week with 3x hooks on each one
- so 15-21 VSLs per week
- some weeks less depending on what we're doing
[23.12.24, 5:08:22] ~ Steve: Some weeks more if it's just iterations like a new hook batch or something
[23.12.24, 5:08:59] ~ Steve: We need a 2nd one soon. Will test a few in new year
[23.12.24, 5:09:22] ~ Nebil: 15-21 VSL’s? are they mini VSL’s? Thats a really good deal ‎<This message was edited>
[23.12.24, 5:09:52] ~ Steve: Yeah like 1-3 minutes usually
[23.12.24, 5:10:29] ~ Steve: Now we're up on Applovin it will be more. Will do ones made just for app loving, ones just made for FB, ones just made for TikTok but we're not gonna run too many TikTok ads
[23.12.24, 5:10:58] ~ Steve: Well let our creators do that and anything that gets good organic reach well put spend behind. That's all been set up now. Product went to creators this week
[23.12.24, 5:11:56] ~ Steve: Yeah I write them all myself and storyboard them pretty detailed. Impossible for the editor to fuck it up
[23.12.24, 5:14:24] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Steve⁩ with AppLovin can you just send the traffic to a shopify product page?
[23.12.24, 5:15:09] ~ Steve: Think so, it's a black hole for me at the moment. We literally are just getting started. I'm hoping to have stuff running there in a week? But more likely week of Jan 3 if I'm being honest
[23.12.24, 5:15:19] ~ Steve: Next week is essentially a dead week with holidays
[23.12.24, 5:15:57] ~ Steve: We pulled back spend a little to anticipate poor performance this weekend which were seeing. US shopping fatigue going on right now. Normal
[23.12.24, 5:16:04] ~ Steve: Should pick up again after xmas
[23.12.24, 5:16:05] ~ Phil: You guys don’t think it’s worth wasting money on testing products the next week or so?
[23.12.24, 5:16:33] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Phil⁩ i would wait personally myself ‎<This message was edited>
[23.12.24, 5:16:43] ~ Steve: I'd still test, well still run things we just temper expectations. Tuesday is a huge US travel day
[23.12.24, 5:17:09] ~ Steve: If anything gets a pulse it'd be worth running it again in new year too
[23.12.24, 5:17:10] ~ Mason Schulze: Especially atleast the next few days
[23.12.24, 5:17:40] ~ Steve: New year new you time of year is always glorious
[23.12.24, 5:18:12] ~ Steve: Everything were launching is that theme right now. I wrote 15 VSLs, and storyboarded 27 static ads today alone
[23.12.24, 5:18:19] ~ Steve: Most were new year new you specific
[23.12.24, 5:19:40] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Steve⁩ your in supps right?
[23.12.24, 5:20:21] ~ Phil: Okay cheers bro
[23.12.24, 5:20:39] ~ Steve: Hydration supplements and bottles
[23.12.24, 5:20:52] ~ Phil: I’ll keep that in consideration thanks man
[23.12.24, 5:22:53] ~ Mason Schulze: Nice!
[23.12.24, 9:32:25] ~ Matt: What’s your order volume for that many inquiries and what AOV?
[23.12.24, 9:32:48] ~ Matt: Sometimes if it’s positioned to lower end of market they are the worst customers
[23.12.24, 9:32:54] ~ Matt: Always complaining
[23.12.24, 9:39:27] ~ Mason Schulze: i sell an anxiety and insomnia relief product so most of the customers are mentally not doing too well.
[23.12.24, 9:39:36] ~ Mason Schulze: which makes it extra fucked
[23.12.24, 10:09:22] ~ Bazeed: get your VAs to use merlin.ai

i have 2 people handling 150+ emails a day with it
[23.12.24, 10:12:10] ~ Bazeed: merlin learns from your past emails from your customers and based on it your vas can add the extension to their browser and can do 1 click automatical replies instead of manually replying and handling queries
[23.12.24, 10:13:13] ~ Mason Schulze: oh that's awesome
[23.12.24, 10:13:21] ~ Mason Schulze: thanks @⁨~Bazeed⁩
[23.12.24, 10:48:09] ~ Matt: Oh Yh that does make a big difference, we used to sell weighted blankets for anxiety/autism etc and the amount of customers that would contact was way higher then other product categories
[23.12.24, 10:48:44] ~ Mason Schulze: its a good niche because its evergreen and big problem solver
[23.12.24, 10:48:56] ~ Mason Schulze: but the customers are really narky
[23.12.24, 10:49:35] ~ Phil: Do they complain that it doesn’t work or something??
[23.12.24, 10:54:36] ~ Matt: Yh lol, we had many full on meltdowns about very minor things
[23.12.24, 11:06:03] ~ Mason Schulze: We have a 100 day Money back guarantee that drives alot of sales, but in the terms they have to pay for return postage and a restocking fee, they don't like that at all and think they can just try it and send it back
[23.12.24, 11:11:10] ~ Phil: Yeah that’s crazy, customers never happy aye ahaha
[23.12.24, 11:15:17] ~ Mason Schulze: Not all of them but enough to be a pain
[23.12.24, 12:17:23] ~ Mason Schulze: Does anyone have any brands i can look up for good examples of Long VSLs pain relief products
[23.12.24, 12:24:16] ~ Matt: Anyone have a good Chinese 3PL ? I’m looking at portless but wanted to see if there are others that are good
[23.12.24, 12:24:39] ~ Wouter: eccomops is good
[23.12.24, 12:35:24] ~ Matt: How have you found delivery times? Do you ship to EU or USA?
[23.12.24, 13:11:09] ~ Daniel: hey guys, for those running multiple markets - do you use the same pixel for all stores? For example I have a store in the US and I want to launch a separate one for UK, should I use the same pixel, or a new one?
[23.12.24, 13:13:32] ~ Timotej: One pixel for all markets. 

But as we speak, we are brainstorming to separate pixels/ad-accounts based on: 
- advertorial camps
- ⁠VSL campaigns

Never tested this tho, but the idea is to feed the pixel of people that are wathing long-form VSLs, or reading long-form text. 

Anyone tested this maybe?
[23.12.24, 13:14:10] ~ Daniel: makes sense thanks a lot for sharing @⁨~Timotej⁩ !
[23.12.24, 13:20:48] ~ M A N U E L: is running same domain and page in different ad accounts a problem?
[23.12.24, 13:21:04] ~ Timotej: No.
[23.12.24, 13:21:33] ~ M A N U E L: ok thanks man
[23.12.24, 13:21:37] ~ M A N U E L: my agency told me this
[23.12.24, 13:22:42] ~ Timotej: We are using one pixel with 15+ domains, and 7 FB pages … never faced any issue. 

Never blindly trust an agency. hahah
[23.12.24, 13:23:49] ~ M A N U E L: damn, also different accounts?
[23.12.24, 13:25:16] ~ Timotej: Sure - we separate ad accounts per: 
- product 
- ⁠country 

Easier for media buyers to manage camps, tracks costs via API., etc.
[23.12.24, 13:28:16] ~ Num: im doing this also but i face OVERTRACK IN MY ADS MANAGER do you have it too?
[23.12.24, 13:28:55] ~ Timotej: no. maybe - check attribution windows settings.
[23.12.24, 13:48:35] ~ Mason Schulze: How about using different pages for different countries? or the same page and same pixel for all?
[23.12.24, 13:51:48] Topi: Multicountry here, same pixel, different pages, different ad accounts
[23.12.24, 13:53:15] ~ Mason Schulze: any particular reason for different pages? I saw Spacegoods running ads in some EU countries but using the same page still
[23.12.24, 13:53:34] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Lovro Knavs⁩ ☝
[23.12.24, 13:53:44] Topi: for localized content / difersify risk
[23.12.24, 14:33:03] ~ Mason Schulze: how do you go about connecting the same pixel to different stores?
[23.12.24, 14:33:58] ~ Mason Schulze: i tried doing it through the Facebook sales channel on shopify but only allows to have one connected to each store, do you just manually install the pixel code in the backend?
[23.12.24, 14:34:13] ~ Phil: Try Trackbee @⁨~Mason Schulze⁩
[23.12.24, 14:34:19] ~ Phil: I use that for all my pixel tracking
[23.12.24, 14:34:34] ~ Phil: Not sure if you can track the same pixel with all stores but I assume it works
[23.12.24, 14:34:48] Topi: wetracked
[23.12.24, 14:34:53] ~ Phil: It says you can use the Facebook sales channel with it but you also don’t need it
[23.12.24, 16:07:38] ~ Davide: How do you guys find real doctor or authority for your brands and including them on the ads
I have looked on Backstage but I received many submissions and candidates that are not what I’m looking for
[23.12.24, 16:08:29] Topi: dm
[23.12.24, 16:21:14] ~ Arad Khazabi: Just had a general question!

Do you guys suggest me getting an amex card? As I know a lot of entrepreneurs use it for certain benefits.
And if yes, for which card should I apply for?
[23.12.24, 19:15:56] ~ Ry: Anyone’s fb stop spending all of a sudden？
[23.12.24, 19:19:33] ~ Arad Khazabi: is there anyway to message ugc creators without them accepting an invitation that requires them to pay for connections in order to speak with me?:
https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01e9ee256cb928c329?referrer_url_path=%2Fnx%2Fsearch%2Ftalent%2F

I don't see any option to do that besides the regular version which is inviting them to view my open jobs for them
[23.12.24, 19:21:14] ~ Steve: feel like I am missing something here guys - what is the obsession with hiring UGC people off upwork? I would never ever sort of consider it lol
‎[23.12.24, 19:21:24] ~ Steve: ‎image omitted
[23.12.24, 19:21:30] ~ Steve: there are THOUSANDS on twitter
[23.12.24, 19:22:04] ~ Steve: and thousands of more people posting a thread looking for UGC creators, just go in the comments of the thread, start sourcing people, i dunno
[23.12.24, 19:28:30] ~ Steve: if i was absolutely desperate and every other possible option was exhausted i guess i’d look for help on upwork
[23.12.24, 19:28:39] ~ Steve: but even then my expectations would low AF
[23.12.24, 19:34:11] ~ Gideon: ‎This message was deleted.
[23.12.24, 20:23:54] ~ Tom: Look for the in threads, all top 100+ results are asking ridiculous prices and quality is worse than small creators who are happy to get few jobs
[23.12.24, 20:34:34] ~ Guy Edan: A buddy of mine found a really good doctor on LinkedIn
[23.12.24, 20:38:05] ~ Andrea: Hire VAs to scrape leads and do outreach
[23.12.24, 20:38:40] ~ Andrea: And probably get your outreach message looked at by a lawyer so you dont type anything crazy that could get you sued by said doctors
[23.12.24, 22:31:23] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Best page builder?
[23.12.24, 22:53:13] ~ Phil: I heard Gempages is pretty good
[23.12.24, 23:05:42] ~ Bazeed: yep gem pages is best so far for shopify
[23.12.24, 23:07:10] ~ Steve: Gempages has good page speed for sure. Checkout champ is ok but really only if you have extended funnels
[23.12.24, 23:07:42] ~ Steve: Any reason why I don't see much mention of Replo here? Seems lots of people can take a figma design, map in Replo and deploy extremely rapidly
[23.12.24, 23:07:55] ~ Steve: Curious if you all have experience running advertorials in Replo for example
[23.12.24, 23:08:10] ~ Andrea: its different from the other page builders for no reason
[23.12.24, 23:08:26] ~ Kyle Twohill: I found replo a bit tricky to work with compared to gempages, but never spent much time on it in all fairness
[23.12.24, 23:08:36] ~ Andrea: I have used pagefly gempages funnelish replo and replo Is the only different one
[23.12.24, 23:09:16] ~ Steve: Interesting. We just hired a guy for a trial. Gave him a figma our designer did for a new website launch were doing
[23.12.24, 23:09:34] ~ Steve: He built it in Replo in less than 48 hours for like $500. All pages
[23.12.24, 23:09:43] ~ Steve: Looks 99% identical. Minor minor changes
[23.12.24, 23:09:45] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Okay great guys!
[23.12.24, 23:35:47] ~ Bazeed: replo and gempages are same in terms of visuals imo, replo is judt more advanced and too much a headache imo, you need a good designer for replo
[24.12.24, 0:02:00] ~ Steve: Agree
[24.12.24, 0:02:26] ~ Steve: we certainly found a good and cheap and fast replo guy, especially if you already have someone design the figma, guy was laser quick
[24.12.24, 2:00:08] Topi: Hey, anyone experience with skiio subscriptions? Looking to understand their onboarding process
[24.12.24, 3:32:38] ~ Nikita: anyone have any good material to study for creatives?
[24.12.24, 4:31:42] ~ Al: Dara Denney is solid
[24.12.24, 4:31:45] ~ Al: Sarah Levinger too
[24.12.24, 6:12:10] ~ Cody Chaffee: look at ryze mushroom coffee ads
[24.12.24, 6:13:25] ~ Maksym: we’ve broken down about a dozen of those, I guess the specific question is non-UGC ads
[24.12.24, 9:49:57] ~ Gideon: What are you guys doing to keep the sales up during the slow christmas days? Do you lower thr budgets or have special promotions or something else? Im curious to your thoughts. Last years I ran a special offer with a free gift and it worked well
[24.12.24, 9:59:27] ~ Max: yoo anyone spending over 3K a day consistently on taboola or demand gen with image ads? Would love to have a chat
[24.12.24, 14:59:17] ~ Bazeed: for the guys that are using agengy ad accounts for fb, is it important to add your domain to their business manager to verify or it dosent make a difference?

i have my own business manager for the brand with verified domain but ill be running some ads from agency ad account, so do i need to verify domain there as well? thanks ‎<This message was edited>
[24.12.24, 17:28:16] ~ Jonny: We hired 4 ugc creators from Upwork. 2 were terrible, 1 was ok and 1 creators ads has done over 350k in revenue. 

So I wouldn’t write Upwork off. ‎<This message was edited>
[24.12.24, 17:31:11] ~ Mithiran: How much are you paying the creator who's ad did 350k? Is it hourly
[24.12.24, 17:31:31] ~ Steve: Yeah you can find good people anywhere - just my experience over the years is upwork you need to sift through a lot of trash to find a diamond that's all
[24.12.24, 17:33:04] ~ Jonny: True. Probably similar with twitter too. At least with Upwork you have detailed portfolios to look through and reviews/hours completed/money earned to make decisions and sift the bullshit from the good ones.
[24.12.24, 17:33:18] ~ Jonny: $150, 1 video, 4 hooks
[24.12.24, 17:33:39] ~ Bazeed: right, especially if u do a post most leads come to you inbound.

thats how i hired my video editor, hired 10 fired 8
[24.12.24, 17:56:11] ~ NeuroCup: any fb insider to increase daily spend limit?
[24.12.24, 20:19:03] ~ Steve: subscriptions app in shopify - what are you all loving right now?
[24.12.24, 21:18:20] ~ Charles: Currently using Appstle for its essential features—perfect for handling low volume. Planning to switch to Loop when my new products launch, as I've heard fantastic things about their platform. Recharge is great too but it’s expensive.
[24.12.24, 21:36:21] ~ Yusuf: Hey, any reliable contacts for agency ad accounts with cashback? Currently using bestfulfill and I'm happy with them but they stopped my cashback, looking for diversification
[24.12.24, 21:39:15] ~ RS: Did Bestfulfill remove cashback for everybody? They Also notified me that meta will remove cashback from 2025. I have 5% cashback with them and its very good now but after a few days cashback will be removed
[24.12.24, 21:39:43] ~ Steve: as far as i know its not bestfulfil removing it, its Meta ending that program
[24.12.24, 21:39:53] ~ Steve: could be wrong, but id imagine bestfulfil would continue it if they could
[24.12.24, 21:51:20] ~ Yusuf: I think the same, I guess it's removed for everyone but I was curious if somehow any other agency can keep it
[25.12.24, 2:16:17] ~ Jeb: @⁨~Steve⁩ we use appstle
[25.12.24, 8:25:52] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys I just tested a new advertorial and looks like its winning so far - 1.9% conversion rate compared to 1.5% on shopify product page. CTR for advertorial is 40%

Any ideas what to do next? What data should i be looking at to improve the page?
[25.12.24, 9:10:07] ~ Twizzylit: Test different headlines
[25.12.24, 9:10:44] ~ Twizzylit: Sometimes with advertorials you can raise the price since the audience is warmer than ad to product page
[25.12.24, 13:24:31] ~ Arad Khazabi: hey guys, anyway to connect klarna to youre store without using stripe?
[25.12.24, 13:26:11] Topi: @⁨~Arad Khazabi⁩ klarna merchant, mollie

[25.12.24, 16:54:17] Topi: pipiads is good
[25.12.24, 16:54:49] ~ Omar: Does it work for TikTok ads yeah?
[25.12.24, 16:54:56] ~ Omar: I thought it was purely fb
[25.12.24, 20:10:46] ~ N: Anyone know any vouched TikTok shop account sellers
[25.12.24, 20:24:02] ~ Steve: Like people with several thousands of followers selling their account so you can use it for TikTok shop?

Or you mean a business selling their shop account?
[25.12.24, 20:24:22] ~ N: Is that actually possible ? A ready made shop
[25.12.24, 20:24:31] ~ Steve: Don't think so
[25.12.24, 20:24:37] ~ Steve: Wanted to ask to be clear
[25.12.24, 20:24:44] ~ Steve: I wouldn't buy accounts anymore
[25.12.24, 20:24:53] ~ Steve: Have bought several in the past of 10k follower or more
[25.12.24, 20:25:10] ~ Steve: They've all been banned now. TikTok has caught on to that method mostly
[25.12.24, 20:25:29] ~ Steve: They sweep regularly for that now, just had another one banned last week
[25.12.24, 20:26:15] ~ Steve: Method now is organically growing your account from 0 with the friend method. Create account using attractive female, have her post asking people for a follow if she follows them
[25.12.24, 20:26:26] ~ Steve: But don't sexualize it too much because TikTok doesn't like that either
[25.12.24, 20:26:54] ~ N: No way so u gotta get to 10k first yeah?
[25.12.24, 20:27:13] ~ N: Must be a way around it ?
[25.12.24, 20:27:15] ~ Steve: I think it's 5k now
[25.12.24, 20:27:30] ~ Steve: Actuallt 2k followers sorry
[25.12.24, 20:27:38] ~ N: 2k not too bad
[25.12.24, 20:27:42] ~ Steve: And 20k views in the last month or something
[25.12.24, 20:27:51] ~ Steve: My wife is working on it now since her bought account got slapped
[25.12.24, 20:27:53] ~ N: Let’s see if anyone knows how to buy them without getting banned
[25.12.24, 20:28:14] ~ Steve: You can try with the deviated IP VPN method
[25.12.24, 20:28:19] ~ Steve: But it's getting slapped.
[25.12.24, 20:28:41] ~ Steve: I'm in several TikTok groups for that stuff. If you get around it it's just a matter of time before the ban hammer comes
[25.12.24, 20:28:45] ~ Steve: Unless you're in US
[25.12.24, 20:28:46] ~ N: Hmm I see and once u got ur shop u can sell what ever right
[25.12.24, 20:28:58] ~ N: Nah if ur in US is it easy
[25.12.24, 20:34:47] ~ Steve: Yeah even if you're not in US you can run shop
[25.12.24, 20:34:54] ~ Steve: But you need US paperwork
[25.12.24, 20:35:34] ~ Steve: Like Uas corp and easier with US person on it. My partner is American. We set up easy. And bought two of our own creator accounts with VPN method but both banned now
[25.12.24, 20:35:45] ~ Steve: So I'll go organic method and hire creators in 2025
[25.12.24, 22:19:54] ~ Max: We got 2 seller account approved amd running with US llc paperwork + non us passport
[25.12.24, 22:30:49] ~ N: How long it been running for

[25.12.24, 22:33:49] ~ Max: They pushed support/reps after for verification

[26.12.24, 7:34:17] ~ Bazeed: hey guys anyone has a genuine fb insider that can help with a prepaid ad account?

none of the payment methods work to add funds after I add around $1k a day, netbanking/cards everything bugs out

have raised over 10 support tickets but they are giving me brain rot responses that dont help at all
[26.12.24, 7:36:56] ~ Phil: Have you tried calling them
[26.12.24, 7:38:44] ~ Bazeed: i can only raise support chat ticket but i have been on several calls with them where they try to troubleshoot, still nothing works,

worst support ever, they have hired npcs that dont know anything.

[26.12.24, 11:14:39] ~ Mithiran: How does it work? Does it create a new url or something like that
[26.12.24, 11:17:32] ~ Alvaro De Prada: It creates a new extension (hahah.com/jansbsj?jshaiba) if this makes sense.

But it works perfectly. The only issue is you don’t have (as of now) daily data to look at, just overall
[26.12.24, 11:19:08] ~ Mithiran: Yeah makes sense. Thanks man. 

Also, what do you normally split test first? Ive just been running 1x 2x 3x the whole time. Not sure what to change

[27.12.24, 10:44:41] ~ Al: ChatGPT bro
[27.12.24, 10:45:37] ~ Phil: Anyone in the beauty niche that is doing it dropshipping style and making it work. Would like to ask a few questions if possible. Thanks
[27.12.24, 10:47:36] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah
[27.12.24, 10:53:29] ~ Mason Schulze: Buying page followers on Facebook, does anyone know if it has negative effects when advertising?
[27.12.24, 11:01:54] ~ Gord JB: Ye, we switched from recharge to Skio a few months back. As cost for recharge to level up was not worth it. & skio provide basically the same & a bit more 

All subs went across smoothly in two shop locations - AU & UK

They white glove it & don’t charge set up fees. 

Dm me & I can intro you. 
We would both receive one month free (every little helps!)
[27.12.24, 11:02:35] Topi: Hey bro, thank you for taking time to reply
[27.12.24, 11:02:38] Topi: Dming
[27.12.24, 11:16:10] ~ Gord JB: All g brother 💪🏻
[27.12.24, 11:18:57] ~ Henry: Hey everyone, I’m looking for a killer video editor who can do some 3D animations + product effects as well. Anyone know a where to find them?
[27.12.24, 11:29:45] ~ Ateeb Shahdhar: Any leads for experienced UGC script writers?
[27.12.24, 11:32:54] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Not needed
[27.12.24, 11:53:06] ~ Mithiran: I literally just paid $100 USD for 80 broll clips 30 seconds each. From backstage thats way to expensive haha
[27.12.24, 11:53:38] ~ Arad Khazabi: Man this person is a freaking scammer, it’s ridiculous 🤣
[27.12.24, 11:54:10] ~ Arad Khazabi: Saying that because it’s no voice over it’s 30$ per b roll like imagine 😂

Should be max 10$ per b roll.
[27.12.24, 11:54:54] ~ Mithiran: Nah just try to find someone and pay them an hourly rate like a normal job $10 is still pretty expensive tbh
[27.12.24, 11:55:50] ~ Arad Khazabi: Yea for me it’s like I’m not paying more than $150.

If i genuinely want the creator to work for me, ill might even do $200
[27.12.24, 12:03:51] ~ Mason Schulze: What do you guys do with whitelisting creators, I have this one lady trying to charge for each ad variant on through her page. Is that  normal?
[27.12.24, 17:01:53] ~ Nikola Petkov: ‎~ Lucio Martinez added ~ Nikola Petkov
[27.12.24, 18:57:57] ~ Arad Khazabi: hey guys, if you hire ugc per email, and get started with them, do you guys do a contract with them and send them over the payment after the work is done or how does that work?
[27.12.24, 18:58:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: payment after work is done, no contract
[27.12.24, 18:58:41] ~ Arad Khazabi: thanks brother
[27.12.24, 20:54:36] ~ Davide: How you guys work and manage your team with customer service remotely?
I mean is really tough for me to explain how they have to carefully reply and make a good customer service to people that live in Philippine or other countries like that. 
I would prefer having someone in my office with that role, how you guys work with these people working remotely for customers care?
[27.12.24, 20:57:04] Topi: 1. hire service
[27.12.24, 20:57:20] Topi: 2. build real internal team, SOPs, leader, coaches, team
[27.12.24, 20:57:29] Topi: @⁨~Davide⁩
[27.12.24, 20:57:40] Topi: We scaled to like 600k with service, then internal team
[27.12.24, 20:57:54] Topi: This year we went to PH twice to meet them in person
[27.12.24, 21:02:42] ~ Twizzylit: I’ve been working with the same customer support team for 5+ years just gave them example reply’s and audit emails to better help them understand what to say / do
[27.12.24, 21:33:07] ~ Davide: Customer service team is different than having just an VA that makes customer care 
I’m trying to do in this way, SOPs, always examples, video call etc etc 
The learning process is good but he is not able to handle some different situation by himself… 
I can’t explain him ALL the possible situations 😅 
Can you say me more in depth how you structured the team for customer support?
[27.12.24, 21:34:10] ~ Andrea: Are you in Daily Mentor?
[27.12.24, 21:34:25] ~ Andrea: Claire, the cx service mentor, is really helpful
[28.12.24, 3:00:26] ~ Jeb: I was in daily mentor at one point
[28.12.24, 3:03:18] ~ Parker Godfrey: I created a Google doc that is a customer service handbook. I thought of every possible scenario, and have been adding to it when something new arrives. My CS Team has an escalations sheet where they ask questions they don’t know. Eventually the questions get less and less but the whole time you are adding to you CS Handbook. So if you ever change CS teams or bring it in house, you have a big doc they can search for answers in
[28.12.24, 3:05:53] ~ Steve: Great job. Go a step further and turn this into a custom GPT
[28.12.24, 3:06:13] ~ Steve: Share it with the team and they can prompt any question into the GPT for answer
[28.12.24, 14:34:57] ~ Bazeed: hey legends, for selling multiple countries, what apps do you guys use on shopify for automatic country / currency change, i currently am using worldwide market with all countries inside excluding US
[28.12.24, 15:07:38] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you have Shopify payments, it does everything automatically
[28.12.24, 22:06:57] ~ Gideon: My brothers facebook account has been hacked yesterday. They spent 1600 eir with his account. Now its blocked. No 2fa was active unfortunately. Any chance he will get this money and his adaccount back and any tips what he can do with this? Thanks a lot
[28.12.24, 22:07:18] Topi: if personal account do this:
[28.12.24, 22:07:23] Topi: 1. Instantly dispute charges
[28.12.24, 22:07:56] Topi: 2. go to facebook support as many time as possible so you can get proof you contacted them. There’s big chance they dont give your money back
[28.12.24, 22:08:24] Topi: 3. File criminal report with local authorities (police wont do nothing, just shows youre serious this happened)
[28.12.24, 22:08:42] Topi: your bank will give your money back
[28.12.24, 22:08:56] Topi: the ad account is most likely gone but ill dm you insider, maybe they can help
[28.12.24, 22:22:02] ~ Omar: Call ur bank fb auto approve refunds
[28.12.24, 22:22:06] ~ Omar: But ur ad account will get banned
[28.12.24, 22:44:25] ~ Gideon: Thanks man!
[28.12.24, 22:44:33] ~ Gideon: Thanks
[29.12.24, 3:33:09] ~ Parker Godfrey: Anyone know of an Instagram account recovery person? Organic account with 137k got hacked
[29.12.24, 4:36:29] ~ Mason Schulze: Has anyone bought Facebook followers for a new page and then run ads through that page (Whitelist  Purposes) and had no issues or negative effects to performance?
[29.12.24, 12:11:52] ~ Caesar: Dont do it, it will get shadow-flagged internally. Only get followers by running page likes campaign.
[29.12.24, 12:33:56] ~ chris: Any chance someone here has the advertorial of blissy from back in 2018 about dustmite? Would be highly appreciated 😄 dm

[29.12.24, 16:23:21] ~ Guy Edan: I did it and my CPMs were like $500-$1000. I can’t guarantee it was because of that but probably is
[29.12.24, 16:25:00] ~ Malik: Create a page likes campaign with a little cat as image ads and an ad copy like "1 like for our kitty = 1 hug for him" something like that
[29.12.24, 16:25:17] ~ Malik: put it at $5 per day and you will get a ton of likes naturally

[29.12.24, 19:12:49] ~ Tijn Fortuin: How do you guys experience the ad accounts of bestfulfill?
[29.12.24, 19:13:31] Topi: been using now +1 year, spending most of the time 20-40k per day
[29.12.24, 19:13:54] Topi: tested few times against our own accounts and no difference
[29.12.24, 19:19:54] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Great, so good performance?
[29.12.24, 19:21:28] Topi: for us, no issues
[29.12.24, 19:22:15] ~ RS: For me everything food. No issues, spending 5-6k a day
[29.12.24, 23:52:23] ~ Jonny: Worth trying if your ROAS is inconsistent. We were starting to see a bit of stagnation in our main ad account past few weeks. 
Tested a new ad account the past 7 days and seeing much better performance so far. 
CPA’s and other key metrics are much better and roas has improved quite a lot
[30.12.24, 0:14:07] ~ Matt: Have you seen this even if no flags on back end of original ad acc (checked by service provider not personally)?
[30.12.24, 0:43:19] ~ Bazeed: Hey guys, what are some ideal metrics for pain relief US market on meta atm?

Im getting about 50$CPMs
$3 cpc (link clicks)
and about 3% CTR
[30.12.24, 5:10:18] ~ Mithiran: Does anyone have V-Shreds upsell flow?
[30.12.24, 12:23:49] ~ Phil: Hey everyone, qhen you guys test different products do you change your pixel at all or just let the same one go
[30.12.24, 12:41:59] ~ Steve: used to write copy for them, have a bunch of stuff
[30.12.24, 12:42:07] ~ Steve: let me dig through see what i have, nothing super recent
[30.12.24, 12:42:19] ~ Steve: but they’re upsells all follow same/similar structure

[30.12.24, 12:43:26] ~ Steve: recent as of 2022

[30.12.24, 13:30:52] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hi guys, I've been doing ecom for a short period of time.... so far my back end setup has been pretty simple shipping directly from China, but recently I've been considering optimising it. Can someone give me a heads up what the next step should be & how to aproach it? Also would someone be able to give me contact with a supplier in the beauty niche, thanks 🙏
[30.12.24, 13:31:59] ~ Mason Schulze: Pm me if you like i have a great supplier for beauty niche
[30.12.24, 13:45:26] ~ Matt: How do people structure testing new landing pages with meta? Do you duplicate the best performers and then set a budget of target daily CAC for a week and see if new LP performs better?
[30.12.24, 13:47:44] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: Split the traffic in funnelish with the same url, and calculate the revenue per visitor
[30.12.24, 13:49:35] ~ Matt: Theres someone ina group im in who doesnt do a traditional split test but instead just sets up new adsets to different page and sees which one performs better - have you done anything like this before? I’ve done standard split tests but it takes a while to get stat significance
[30.12.24, 13:57:41] ~ Andrea: If it takes too long to get statistical significance maybe it means the test is not high leverage
[30.12.24, 13:57:47] ~ Andrea: Like changing a button color
[30.12.24, 13:57:58] ~ Andrea: If you change the entire offer it shouldn't take *too* long
[30.12.24, 13:58:12] ~ Matt: Yh I usually do big swings as it’s a new brand
[30.12.24, 13:58:34] ~ Matt: So thinking about trying this new method which is a bit simpler
[30.12.24, 13:59:07] ~ Andrea: it sounds more complicated to me but I'm not too familiar with metas BM so idk
[30.12.24, 14:07:41] ~ Klemen: Hi guys, how’s performance on Facebook for you these days?

We’ve been noticing quite a bit of volatility—some days are great, and others are a complete disaster. 

How do you handle volatility?
Let’s say you’re running a campaign at €600/day and have a terrible day—what’s your approach?

Cap the budget?
Pause and relaunch the next day?
Or something else?
[30.12.24, 14:09:19] ~ Nick Jansen: I’m follow this. Got the same problem. Doing 20% profit days and the day after break even of small losses 🤷🏻‍♂️
[30.12.24, 14:09:36] ~ LC: Anyone can drop me a DM with a good FB ad acc agency?
[30.12.24, 14:11:02] ~ Caesar: For me, if one day does bad I just scale down whichever campaign isn't doing good. 

We also know based on 1-2y of performance which days are "bad" and "good" for us, so we scale down/up based on that always as well.

Usually sundays are amazing for us but we had a really bad sunday yesterday compared to our usual days, but that is ads.

Ads are up and down, is what it is, maximize ur cvr, aov, etc, do all that is within your control 👍
[30.12.24, 14:13:56] ~ Klemen: Thanks 🙏 Do you downscale the budget or just pause the campaign? 
I tried scaling down but when i decrease the budget the campaign still overspends, in most cases still 80% of the budget before downscale
[30.12.24, 17:00:58] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: @⁨~Nikola Petkov⁩ - I could definitely give you input on optimizing it. DM me when you have time.
[30.12.24, 17:04:53] ~ Caesar: No I never pause the campaign, a day without running ads is a day lost in my eyes. 

I just downscale the budget.

The reason it still spends is because you downscale during the day.

Budget downscaling on Meta has to be done at midnight, if u do it during the day it wont make a difference from what I see, it will still spend until the OG budget you had.

That is why i always analyze my ads at midnight (well, our media buyer does but you get the point).

If unprofitable i scale down by at least half, usually that fixes it until i find sweet spot, and i just stay there.

Not all products can scale, not all ads can scale.
[30.12.24, 17:05:59] ~ Caesar: And yes, this is why downscaling during the day isnt even an option really, you can scale up during the day though "surf-scaling", but that's if you are proitable and with a good ROAS to merit that kind of agressive scaling, you may have had a good morning, but the evening is coming, the dark times... demons come out at the night time usually bro
[30.12.24, 19:20:22] ~ Robert: Hey guys. Is it possible to open a tiktok shop as a non US resident? I do have a US corp though. ‎<This message was edited>
[30.12.24, 19:21:01] ~ Christopher Murphy: You need a SSN from a US resident
[30.12.24, 19:21:25] ~ Robert: That's it?
[30.12.24, 19:21:40] ~ Christopher Murphy: So if you have family members there or know someone you should be fine
[30.12.24, 19:22:42] ~ Christopher Murphy: You’ll need a phone with VPN without a sim to post content on your branded page
[30.12.24, 19:34:36] ~ Robert: Thanks. Will try!
[30.12.24, 22:53:30] ~ Phil: Work off a 48 hour rule. Everytime you adjust a budget leave it for 2 days. On the 2nd day at night you make your decision whether to bump or cut down 20%. Normally first day of bump or first day of cut down doesn’t do the best but then stables out on the second day
[30.12.24, 22:53:40] ~ Phil: Meta needs time to optimize Everytime you do something with the budget
[31.12.24, 1:54:08] ~ Charles: Never been better for me
[31.12.24, 11:06:07] ~ Bazeed: Hey guys whats the best AI avatar software for cloning spokesperson/ doctor, that looks real,

currently using D-id but its very noticeable as an ai
[31.12.24, 11:17:18] ~ Steve: Heygen
[31.12.24, 11:20:32] ~ Bazeed: great thanks for the reply, ill check it out
[31.12.24, 11:35:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For the guys selling in Europe and having the cookie issue where shopify analytics is messed up, here is how to fix it: 

disable the shopify cookies and install consentmo GDPR, everything works fine again.
[31.12.24, 11:52:43] ~ Caesar: By analytics, do you mean total revenue isn't being tracked accurately? Thanks.
[31.12.24, 11:57:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: mainly visitors, if a visitor denies cookies, nothing of that visitor is getting tracked properly
[31.12.24, 11:58:03] ~ Jeremy Leppink: everything in fb will be fine, its mainly for your shopify analytics, as for if you are using split testing apps such as ab convert or intelligems
[31.12.24, 11:58:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i know this is not the case for everybody which is a bit weird, but i know a lot of people have this problem
[31.12.24, 12:00:24] ~ Caesar: Does cookies show up in English or in the native language of the store?
[31.12.24, 12:17:35] ~ Alex: Hi! we tested 150 products and noticed that a glitter jumpsuit was doing well (around Christmas) now less and are back in the test phase. Do you recommend a new ad account and pixel? from door go
[31.12.24, 13:14:26] ~ Yente Dhooge: I'd stick with the same pixel & ad acc, unless you are planning to test products in a different niche
[31.12.24, 13:39:48] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone using triple whale for attribution
[31.12.24, 13:39:58] ~ Ry: I am
[31.12.24, 13:40:08] ~ Ben Mansour: Is last click the best to make decisions based on?
[31.12.24, 13:44:29] ~ Ry: I use triple attribution to make decisions for meta. I rather steer towards taking credit
[31.12.24, 13:46:30] ~ Ben Mansour: We also use it to take decisions for meta
[31.12.24, 13:46:44] ~ Ben Mansour: The attribution model we rely on currently is last click
[31.12.24, 13:47:00] ~ Ben Mansour: But i heard some people look at total impact instead
[31.12.24, 13:47:10] ~ Ben Mansour: So i wanted to know what are you guys looking at usually
[31.12.24, 13:48:07] ~ Ry: Total impact? Is that same as triple attribution?
[31.12.24, 13:48:32] ~ Ben Mansour: Nope different model
[31.12.24, 14:12:23] ~ Mert M: anyone knows a killer creative agency for shortform ads?
[31.12.24, 14:14:47] ~ Jonny: Anyone here running Tik tok ads? Got a couple of questions if you don’t mind
[31.12.24, 14:15:01] ~ Gideon: I know one ugc style ads
[31.12.24, 14:16:40] ~ Gideon: They create monthly 30 video creatives for me

[31.12.24, 23:55:03] ~ Austin: When writing a new ad script do you give the editor the script and he just sends back a completed ad or do you go through and write out what footage needs to be there line for line ? I've done the line for line brief but damnnnnn does that take some time.
[31.12.24, 23:55:36] ~ Omar: make a asset folder watch ur videos and see what type of clips come up often like woman crying clips
[31.12.24, 23:55:49] ~ Omar: product clips  person going to doctor clips
[31.12.24, 23:56:05] ~ Omar: and on excel put each line in a box and next to it tell the editor what folder to get the video from
[31.12.24, 23:56:49] ~ Steve: Here's what I do bro

[31.12.24, 23:58:07] ~ Omar: yhyh the above similar way
[31.12.24, 23:58:09] ~ Steve: For sure the hooks and intro
[31.12.24, 23:58:17] ~ Matt: Do you generally use the same structure for your VSLs?
[31.12.24, 23:58:48] ~ Steve: I will drop in video clips from stuff I like or see so the editor knows. Our senior editors are pretty good at just grabbing things on their own
[31.12.24, 23:59:04] ~ Omar: how long ur vid editor take to make videos
[31.12.24, 23:59:43] ~ Steve: Depends. But mostly a similar structure yeah. I have a structure for short VSLs (30 seconds to 2 minutes) and one for mini VSLs (2 minutes to 8 minutes) and then I have a whole different structure for 40+ minute VSLs but those take weeks to write
[31.12.24, 23:59:52] ~ Steve: 48 hours max usually
[1.01.25, 0:00:01] ~ Omar: for 1min vsl?
[1.01.25, 0:00:18] ~ Steve: But we usually give him like....5-7 videos a week with 3 hooks each and he has to have them done by Friday
[1.01.25, 0:00:24] ~ Steve: Some are as long as 3m
[1.01.25, 0:00:48] ~ Omar: how much u pay ur editor
[1.01.25, 0:01:33] ~ Steve: $1500/mo
[1.01.25, 0:01:40] ~ Steve: We throw as much work at him as we can
[1.01.25, 0:14:13] ~ Matt: Interesting, how do you approach the mini vsls? Any brands you think are doing it well atm?
[1.01.25, 0:18:54] ~ Steve: Tons of brands do them well. I watch what they do, get inspiration from them, also I pay attention a lot to content and shit on twitter and tiktok and Instagram. I watch what goes viral that aren't ads. I'll snip clips from those or take ideas from those and twist them into VSLs
[1.01.25, 0:19:16] ~ Steve: I guess it's a little easier for me since I've been writing 40+ minute VSLs for 11 years
[1.01.25, 0:19:30] ~ Steve: So cracking a 1-5 minute VSL isn't all that difficult
[1.01.25, 0:26:37] ~ Matt: Cheers, any brands come to mind you can mention to have a look at in supp niche?
[1.01.25, 0:26:46] ~ Matt: Yh I bet!
[1.01.25, 0:33:55] ~ Giorgos: Best thing to integrate trendings, especially at the hooks n openings. It works even on old saturated ads - just a tweak there with the new wave and it works. I do this all the time. Its almost free, you just have to be abit observant when doom scrolling
[1.01.25, 0:38:24] ~ Omar: what iterations do u see works the best do u test first few scenes ?
[1.01.25, 1:14:56] ~ Steve: Right now we are selling water soluble hydration supplements so we're looking a lot at what everyday dose does what Nello does on TikTok, and a bunch of others I'll share a list
[1.01.25, 1:16:57] ~ Steve: And then other category leaders in other niches. I look across niches and I get tons of ideas on how I'd use that for our niche
[1.01.25, 1:17:29] ~ Steve: Hook iterations but now (And this is just my hypothesis and it's starting to work) is hook stacking is better than just hook iteration
[1.01.25, 1:17:51] ~ Steve: HOOK + HOOK + HOOK + problem + product intro etc
[1.01.25, 1:18:02] ~ Steve: Pure dopamine hits back to back to back
[1.01.25, 1:22:23] ~ Omar: What about the scene after the hook
[1.01.25, 2:13:55] ~ Steve: Lead/intro
[1.01.25, 2:14:02] ~ Steve: Just stack good hooks
[1.01.25, 2:14:51] ~ Christopher Murphy: IMO arc ads is better than heygen in my experience @⁨~Bazeed⁩
[1.01.25, 2:16:37] ~ Christopher Murphy: @⁨~Ben Mansour⁩ I talked to a triple whale rep recently and they said for media buyers triple attribution is best for optimizing
[1.01.25, 2:18:38] ~ Christopher Murphy: We use hey gen for translating our videos into a different language and arc ads for anything AI avatar related
[1.01.25, 2:21:28] ~ Christopher Murphy: For reference:

[1.01.25, 2:21:43] ~ Christopher Murphy: Arc ads
[1.01.25, 2:23:27] ~ Steve: Those are ok
[1.01.25, 2:23:32] ~ Steve: Nice job on the lips
[1.01.25, 2:23:42] ~ Steve: Personally I'm moving away from AI generated content in 2025
[1.01.25, 2:23:50] ~ Christopher Murphy: Why’s that?
[1.01.25, 2:23:52] ~ Steve: We'll use some but probably less and less
[1.01.25, 2:23:58] ~ Steve: It's saturated
[1.01.25, 2:24:10] ~ Steve: It's been 12-15 months of non stop AI ads in everyone's feed
[1.01.25, 2:24:38] ~ Steve: Founder stories, authentic content, how it works, customer stories etc working a lot better from ppl I'm talking to and our own stuff
[1.01.25, 2:24:49] ~ Steve: We're gonna be optimizing for a lot more of that as we grow the brand
[1.01.25, 2:24:52] ~ Christopher Murphy: It’s just infinitely cheaper 🥲 but yea makes sense
[1.01.25, 2:24:54] ~ Steve: Plus it's better Moat
[1.01.25, 2:25:06] ~ Christopher Murphy: Building a brand with ai videos is super challenging
[1.01.25, 2:25:18] ~ Steve: By mid 2025 I want that every single ad we run is 100% our own footage
[1.01.25, 2:25:29] ~ Steve: Some of the bigger scaling brands I see, they already do this
[1.01.25, 2:25:44] ~ Steve: You see their ads and it's just all stuff they shot themselves or had their agency do etc
[1.01.25, 2:25:51] ~ Steve: Think you're gonna see a lot more of that
[1.01.25, 2:26:18] ~ Steve: Plus meta is just gonna get better and better at slapping AI ads
[1.01.25, 2:26:48] ~ Steve: I don't think meta wants it's whole platform just flooded with AI generated content all the time. Could be wrong. Who knows
[1.01.25, 2:27:30] ~ Christopher Murphy: Yea makes sense, we’re starting to explore more and more AI but also getting real content in parallel
[1.01.25, 2:27:51] ~ Christopher Murphy: Have you seen CPMs shoot up for AI content?
[1.01.25, 2:27:59] ~ Steve: That's prob best bet
[1.01.25, 2:28:03] ~ Steve: Use a mix of both
[1.01.25, 2:32:29] ~ NeuroCup: could you give an example of what you mean?
‎[1.01.25, 3:09:28] ~ Steve: ‎video omitted
[1.01.25, 3:09:49] ~ Steve: Maybe not best example as Vshred is $400m+ company so they can do a lot of cool shit
[1.01.25, 3:10:02] ~ Steve: But the structure here. Do you see how every scene is like a new hook
[1.01.25, 3:10:19] ~ Steve: It's just hook after hook after hook but it all works in service to the message and mechanism
[1.01.25, 3:11:08] ~ Andrea: Happy new years, wish all of you nothing but the best!
[1.01.25, 3:21:28] ~ NeuroCup: got it, thanks
[1.01.25, 10:27:31] ~ Mason Schulze: Happy New Year, legends hope you all make a ton of $$ in 2025
[1.01.25, 10:27:50] ~ Mason Schulze: Does anyone use webflow to build their funnels?
[1.01.25, 19:57:46] ~ Giorgos: have a great year 
health and prosperity
hope u achieve all goals u target
[1.01.25, 22:35:16] ~ Nal: Does anyone here have a good agency ad account supplier they are willing to share please?
[2.01.25, 5:29:51] ~ Parker Godfrey: In the 1 CBO Strategy, how many adsets do you typically keep on? Should I turn off ads that haven't got spend for 5-7 days?
[2.01.25, 5:32:14] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: +63 970 910 8295
Pinnacle media say you got referred by rudra. Really good for starting i saw their ad accounts performing better than my other agencies. Fees is a bit higher on start but they also provide Grey Hat ad accounts which is such a relief, let's you run aggressive creatives easily and they lower their fees as u scale
[2.01.25, 5:32:21] ~ Ben Mansour: Nope
[2.01.25, 5:32:34] ~ Ben Mansour: If they are not good they don‘t get spend anyways
[2.01.25, 5:45:44] ~ Parker Godfrey: Gotcha thanks!
[2.01.25, 5:52:26] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yoo i have a question too how do you structure your adsets in the cbo? One for testing one for scaling or you seperate ad sets by angles or concepts?
[2.01.25, 5:55:54] ~ Ben Mansour: Just angles and concepts and each adset should not have more than 6 creatives. For testing new creatives, we every batch in new adset with minimum spend of 10$ daily, if they reach 2x average cpa with no conversions we just remove minimum spend, we don‘t turn off
[2.01.25, 6:00:02] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Interesting thanks.
[2.01.25, 6:32:28] ~ Parker Godfrey: And what do you recommend when an ad is sucking all the spend but under performing? Someone told me there is a reason its sucking all the spend, so leave it on and iterate off it. But its killing overall performance because my new iterations arent getting any budget.
[2.01.25, 6:37:03] ~ Ben Mansour: Yep means it works on tof and other mof and bof ads are converting the warm audience from it
[2.01.25, 6:37:15] ~ Ben Mansour: Give the iterations minimum spend
[2.01.25, 6:37:47] ~ Ben Mansour: If the overall campaign is profitable, that‘s what matters
[2.01.25, 6:38:07] ~ Ben Mansour: Try to try new concepts in tof as well
[2.01.25, 6:38:19] ~ Parker Godfrey: Its not...but I just set it to $10 per day. So Ill let those run. My avg CPA is $70, should $10 be enough?
[2.01.25, 6:38:55] ~ Parker Godfrey: When targeting TOF, just create more broad angle ads right? Cuz the CBO spends where it wants...
[2.01.25, 6:40:32] ~ Ben Mansour: You can give more, 10$ is just for getting spend quickly, if it‘s good facebook will spend way more on it
[2.01.25, 6:41:10] ~ Ben Mansour: Yep try different concepts and angles
[2.01.25, 6:41:17] ~ Ben Mansour: Also look at what competitors are doing
[2.01.25, 6:41:30] ~ Ben Mansour: And try to re create same concepts but better
[2.01.25, 6:45:21] ~ Parker Godfrey: @⁨~Ben Mansour⁩ Can I DM you?
[2.01.25, 6:46:36] ~ Ben Mansour: Sure man!
[2.01.25, 6:48:49] ~ Max: damn dr drew chasing that cash
[2.01.25, 7:04:35] ~ Parker Godfrey: Is there anyone here running a multiple SKU store with 50 SKUs+ that I could ask a few questions about how you have your ads set up?
[2.01.25, 7:33:21] ~ Robert: I'm approaching 100 SKUs atm, what's up?
[2.01.25, 7:35:32] ~ Parker Godfrey: How do you structure your ad account? I know a lot of people here do the 1 CBO strategy. I'm thinking that may be best for single-product stores, but I'm wondering if you run that too or if you have an ABO Testing with a CBO Scaling? or do you have a separate campaign for each product type? Happy to DM if that's better for you
[2.01.25, 7:36:14] ~ Robert: 1 CBO campaign, i only run ads for my offer. My other SKUs are upsold other ways, mainly on the product page, in the cart in 3 diff ways, or via email flows
[2.01.25, 7:37:06] ~ Robert: Email campaigns as well
[2.01.25, 7:37:30] ~ Parker Godfrey: Okay gotcha, I'm running a fashion brand so I don't do funnels
[2.01.25, 7:37:46] ~ Robert: wdym u dont do funnels?
[2.01.25, 7:38:01] ~ Robert: Your fashion brand should still have an offer you run right?
[2.01.25, 7:38:28] ~ Robert: For example, isn't Fabletics offer like 3 gym shorts for $10 or something like that?
[2.01.25, 7:39:20] ~ Robert: i think thats the mens offer and the females offer is similar but with leggings
[2.01.25, 7:40:27] ~ Parker Godfrey: Yeah we have evergreen Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off or BOGO during holiday sales. But we are trying to position ourselves as a high end brand, so we don't want to run offers front facing 100% of the time. Open to your thoughts tho, I'm willing to test anything
[2.01.25, 7:42:34] ~ Robert: It's hard to advertise without an insane offer. The offer is like your bread and butter. Figuring out what they want as an offer is also complex, it shouldn't be as simple as BOGO or B1G1 50% off.. It should be something they actually buy. You should be able to analyze your sales data and see what they would like as a bundle.

At the end of the day. Facebook ads aren't a way to make one sale and profit from that one sale. Facebook ads are a way to introduce people to your brand. Understand your LTV:CAC pull them in and cash out on future cash flow through email campaigns/flows. Your offer is what secures your future cash flow.
[2.01.25, 7:43:34] ~ Robert: Other people may disagree but that's how I view advertising on facebook.
[2.01.25, 7:43:39] ~ Robert: Otherwise you might as well just sell on Amazon
[2.01.25, 7:45:21] ~ Parker Godfrey: Okay gotcha yeah! We do have great email marketing. We’re focused heavily this year on increasing our email/SMS pop-up CVR. So a stronger offer on front facing ads and on pop up could be the move
[2.01.25, 7:46:10] ~ Parker Godfrey: But I agree with a brand like mine, it’s a brand awareness tool and if you can do it profitably on the front end that’s where you’ll see huge growth
[2.01.25, 7:46:32] ~ Robert: for sure, that will make big changes especially if you have a high LTV:CAC already
[2.01.25, 8:11:18] ~ Henry: Nice man. What percentage do you aim for with email pop up CVR?
[2.01.25, 8:11:56] ~ Parker Godfrey: This year our target is 5% Email and 3% SMS. Wbu?
[2.01.25, 8:12:38] ~ Parker Godfrey: Open to some tips or strategies if anyone is seeing higher
[2.01.25, 12:34:58] ~ Mikael: Anyone noticing "delayd" Payouts from Shopify payments? Our payouts are still in "Scheduled" and havent been paid.
[2.01.25, 12:35:42] ~ Mason Schulze: I have 12% when I last checked
[2.01.25, 12:36:01] ~ Mason Schulze: Message me if you like
[2.01.25, 12:50:45] ~ Jonny: Where do you guys source Tik tok creatives?

[2.01.25, 16:54:20] ~ Alex Lever: Is it possible to use a US buy now pay later gateway on a store using a currency that’s not USD?

Klarna doesn’t work for me as my store’s currency is GBP and I have a UK ltd. So I’m looking at using affirm or afterpay if i can. 

Do you guys use any other ones?

[2.01.25, 18:00:39] ~ YUSUF: Hey guys, those who use Funnelish, how do you handle sales tax, especially for multiple states? 

Funnelish doesn’t have a built-in tax calculator or open API to build a custom integration.

I’ve been looking into tax software like Avalara and AccurateTax, but the integration with Funnelish is an issue.

Do you just add tax to the product price, use hidden products, or something else?
[2.01.25, 18:39:00] ~ Andrea: TaxJar
[2.01.25, 18:39:15] ~ Andrea: I set everything up regarding US Sales tax for the last brand I've worked with, DM if you need help ‎<This message was edited>
[2.01.25, 18:55:07] ~ YUSUF: I’m using TaxJar right now. It doesn’t work great when scaling, also gets expensive for handling multiple states
[2.01.25, 18:55:30] ~ YUSUF: and it’s not an SST Certified Service Provider.
[2.01.25, 18:56:05] ~ Andrea: What's not working great when scaling ?
[2.01.25, 19:39:09] ~ Ben Mansour: Hello
[2.01.25, 19:39:43] ~ Ben Mansour: If anyone has run some a/b tests on email pop up before
[2.01.25, 19:40:03] ~ Ben Mansour: Can you tell me about which appearance timing/scroliing % worked best for you?
[2.01.25, 19:40:15] ~ Ben Mansour: In terms of email submissions and cvr
[2.01.25, 19:41:56] ~ Ben Mansour: We tested 5 seconds against 10 seconds, 5 seconds has more submission rate but 10 seconds has higher revenue aov by $7 somehow (both got exactly same number of orders luckily hahah) ‎<This message was edited>
[2.01.25, 19:42:50] ~ Ben Mansour: What time or scroll % that worked well for you can you recommend for us to test?
[2.01.25, 19:43:21] ~ Ben Mansour: Also any tips for copy, tweaks on pop up to increase cvr/submission rate will be highly appreciated, thanks!
[2.01.25, 20:05:01] ~ Mikael: Did shopify payments push forward your payout till tomorrow aswell? (3rd jan) this happen for both our stores now
[2.01.25, 20:06:33] ~ Parker Godfrey: It did for everyone. The stock market was closed in the US yesterday, so that’s what I’m expecting is happening. The banks were closed on holiday as well.
[2.01.25, 20:06:58] ~ Mikael: Good to know thx.
[2.01.25, 21:24:50] ~ Matt: Full screen pop up and surprise discount worked best for us (bedding niche)
[2.01.25, 21:26:02] ~ Matt: Check what time people bounce and then test the pop up 1 second before

[2.01.25, 23:39:20] ~ Phil: Yeah I have been but on a new ad account
[2.01.25, 23:39:35] ~ Guy Edan: Skincare
[2.01.25, 23:39:45] ~ Phil: Same @⁨~Guy Edan⁩
[2.01.25, 23:39:56] ~ Phil: Seems really competitive
[2.01.25, 23:40:08] ~ Phil: The more natural the ad is the lower your CPM’s can go too
[2.01.25, 23:40:09] ~ Guy Edan: How new? This ad account is about 3 months old with about $3k in spend
[2.01.25, 23:40:21] ~ Phil: Mines around 1 month
[2.01.25, 23:40:25] ~ Phil: Not even 1k spend
[2.01.25, 23:40:40] ~ Guy Edan: How low did u get? Haha
[2.01.25, 23:40:44] ~ Phil: Some days CPMS are good and some days they are rubbish
[2.01.25, 23:40:52] ~ Phil: Sometimes in the 30’s
[2.01.25, 23:41:08] ~ Phil: Sometimes in the 100’s ahahah
[2.01.25, 23:41:11] ~ Guy Edan: Wow. I wish. Lowest we had was a few days of $120 and I was happy
[2.01.25, 23:41:29] ~ Nal: We have the same thing with skincare nice on new ad account with about 1k spend
[2.01.25, 23:41:40] ~ Guy Edan: Average is like $200-$300. even though we have a solid conversation rate, can’t really profit with those CPMs
[2.01.25, 23:41:48] ~ Phil: It’s really competitive
[2.01.25, 23:41:50] ~ Nal: We had $100-$200
[2.01.25, 23:42:19] ~ Guy Edan: Did u manage to improve it or still that high?
[2.01.25, 23:43:38] ~ Guy Edan: There’s obviously a ton of skincare brands so I feel like there has to be a way to make it work as I find it hard to believe that brands like Miami MD and city beauty pay $300 cpms 🤦🏻‍♂️
[2.01.25, 23:45:07] ~ Matt: Try making your own whitelisted pages from a dermatologist or relevant authority in skincare, create 3-5, use faces in profile pic and see which can produce lower CPMs if at all. Sometimes can help reduce CPMs by 20-30%. I’ve tested with content and without content on pages and it doesn’t make much difference.
[2.01.25, 23:49:40] ~ Guy Edan: Will try that. Thanks!
[2.01.25, 23:51:18] ~ Nal: No it’s stayed at that point till we got our ad account banned 😂
[2.01.25, 23:52:21] ~ LC: Do you guys test top 5 right off the bat or just USA?
[3.01.25, 0:03:23] ~ Jonny: Try WW targeting and exclude a bunch of countries. Most spend pushes to T1 countries anyway
[3.01.25, 0:04:56] ~ Jonny: Exclude high fraud countries and low GDP countries. Do English speaking only. 
See how they perform. Our WW campaigns completely outperform our t1 campaigns
[3.01.25, 0:18:47] ~ M: WW?
[3.01.25, 0:20:07] ~ Jonny: Worldwide
[3.01.25, 0:23:11] ~ Nal: Interested in this also. I know some people even start testing WW off the bat
[3.01.25, 0:23:55] ~ Wouter: But you need to add all countries to your checkout right

[3.01.25, 19:40:44] ~ Musawer: How is your Facebook ad performance after new year? Is there a big difference before and after Christmas?

[3.01.25, 23:29:33] ~ Phil: Hey guys, 

This isn’t ecom related but I’m sure you have all been through it to get where you are. 

How did you all stop your bad habits that weighed you down or distracted you from working. I’m struggling a bit with this since my store went down due to a 100% hold and I think I’m struggling a little bit with distractions. 

Any tips on how you guys do it or done it would be greatly appreciated!
[3.01.25, 23:34:54] ~ Parker Godfrey: Set your priorities straight and understand the work now will create the freedom for your future. You also have to fall in love with the game, to where going out or going on trips feels like more mental stress than actually locking in on your work. Once you start seeing the results of your labor, it will become addicting and you will rather work on building your future than spending time on things that are temporarily satisfying.

Get clear on a goal, then be discipline, consistent, and patient. The end goal shouldn’t always be the focus everyday, fall in love with the process and small wins throughout. Then when you look up, you will have reached your goal.
[3.01.25, 23:36:05] ~ Phil: Yeha thank you bro, this was literally me a few months ago nothing could stop me I was addicted. Made some great money. Then got a hold from Shopify that turned it upset down for me. My own fault which I will fix but now it’s getting back in the rythm again which I’m finding it hard to do

[4.01.25, 4:03:28] ~ Austin: There's no way? How do you get around this ASAP?
[4.01.25, 4:06:08] ~ Al: 1- delete old ads that are turned on inside of campaigns/adsets that are off
2- use another page
3- spend more (I believe a couple of years back the limit was based on your monthly spend but I'm not sure if this has changed)

PS. Loving the ad preview! Interesting style 👀
[4.01.25, 4:08:39] ~ Austin: UGC / Testimonials are going hard for us right now, both retargeting and cold, even weird shit like DM voice messages work and if you have authority even better.
[4.01.25, 9:28:09] ~ RakanGammoh: Hello Gents,

Happy New Year! Wishing you all great success this year.

Quick question: Is it okay to use multiple pixels from different Business Managers on the same landing pages / Website ? Could this cause bans or issues? I got an email from a Facebook rep saying it’s not allowed. Does anyone have insights on this?

Thanks! ‎<This message was edited>
[4.01.25, 14:33:45] ~ NeuroCup: does increasing the daily budget on bid caps resets the learning phase?
[4.01.25, 16:12:21] ~ M: What do you guys think about a advertorial about on a founders story about why we created the product and how it wa s asolution for our own problemt o start with that we then wanted to help others with?
[4.01.25, 16:23:01] ~ NeuroCup: with good copy anything works
[4.01.25, 16:23:20] ~ M: fair enough good point
[4.01.25, 16:27:19] ~ Bazeed: no but u do have to wait for a week to see actual difference in performance if youre on 1 week attribution
[4.01.25, 16:27:34] ~ NeuroCup: founder story actually needs to be good tho, personally and affinity wise
[4.01.25, 16:28:10] ~ NeuroCup: CharityWater has a great VSL founder story
[4.01.25, 16:29:23] ~ Mithiran: Wdym by if you have authority even better? Are you talking about an authority figure?
[4.01.25, 16:30:54] ~ M: Thanks man lemme see that one, i appreciate the help a ton
[4.01.25, 16:31:08] ~ M: Tryna get the advertorial stuff right
[4.01.25, 16:31:08] ~ M: Haha
[4.01.25, 16:32:11] ~ NeuroCup: I just launched the campaign today, getting 4x lower CPA already. But my budget is just $500/d, and with this CPA i could literally print
[4.01.25, 16:32:51] ~ M: https://www.charitywater.org/uk/about/scott-harrison-story , this one?
[4.01.25, 16:33:29] ~ Bazeed: yes if ads are good it will do it but a lot of times cause of the bid cap it dosent spend the full budget even if u increase it a lot, but its a good way to maintain profits even during inconsistent days on fb
[4.01.25, 16:34:22] ~ NeuroCup: i’m increasing the budget, let’s see how it performs. thanks!

[5.01.25, 8:05:31] ~ Phil: Hey guys, 

May be a stupid question but does anyone know how to make gem pages work faster on your Shopify store. Like when I load my website everything is so slow
[5.01.25, 8:05:50] ~ Phil: Ever since I started using gem pages
[5.01.25, 8:06:27] ~ Ben Mansour: Do you use it for advertorials or product page?
[5.01.25, 8:06:44] ~ Phil: Product page
[5.01.25, 8:07:10] ~ Ben Mansour: Ah okk
[5.01.25, 8:07:22] ~ Ben Mansour: For complex product pages
[5.01.25, 8:07:34] ~ Ben Mansour: It‘s better to hire a designer and a developer
[5.01.25, 8:07:48] ~ Ben Mansour: They will make a good page and responsive
[5.01.25, 8:08:00] ~ Phil: Ohh okay
[5.01.25, 8:08:08] ~ Phil: Thanks for the advice
[5.01.25, 8:08:29] ~ Ben Mansour: Welcome
[5.01.25, 8:08:45] ~ Ben Mansour: I have some advertorials ready on gempages that i didn‘t launch yet

[5.01.25, 8:12:21] ~ Phil: Also my add to cart doesn’t add the item straight away it takes a while for the product to show up in the cart
[5.01.25, 8:12:35] ~ Phil: Is there a way to fix this
[5.01.25, 8:12:47] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: lmfao that's the exact issue I am facing
[5.01.25, 8:13:34] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: even I had free gifts in my offer and I had a app which auto adds to cart the products and it doesn't work with gempages
[5.01.25, 8:14:24] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: and figured out if I skip the atc page and go direct to checkout the auto atc for free gifts app works fine
[5.01.25, 8:15:37] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: also I have one more issue I integrated my fb pixel to the codes of theme manually. and it doesn't track anything, how do u integrate your pixel using gempages to make it work bro?
[5.01.25, 8:20:23] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Dmed you bro
[5.01.25, 8:21:56] ~ Phil: Yeah I just want to figure out how I can get the add to cart to go to my cart drawer instead of my cart
[5.01.25, 8:25:19] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah I checked it doesn't take u to cart drawer just to the page 🥲
[5.01.25, 8:25:30] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Do u have any solution to this bro?
[5.01.25, 8:26:09] ~ Phil: It’s first time using gem pages bro so unfortunately not man sorry
[5.01.25, 8:26:26] ~ Phil: Wonder if there is a way to take it to a cart drawer instead
[5.01.25, 8:27:03] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah fr or gonna go back to shrine until I find a solution
[5.01.25, 9:01:34] ~ Phil: Message gem pages support
[5.01.25, 9:01:43] ~ Phil: They have the technical team looking into it for me

[5.01.25, 11:14:58] ~ Mert M: Anyone knows a plug who sells ig pages with alot followers?
[5.01.25, 11:37:56] ~ Steve: Hey guys - anyone have a solid post purchase welcome email sequence and post purchase upsell sequence for supplements they can share?

Mine need an update
[5.01.25, 12:06:43] ~ Andrea: Reformat every image you have to WEBP
[5.01.25, 12:07:28] ~ Phil: Okay thanks 🙏
[5.01.25, 16:05:12] ~ Alex Lever: Has anyone been able to get Sezzle or Afterpay approved on their store? 

They require proof of an invoice from a supplier but I imagine that they’ll reject the application as soon as they see the supplier is in China
[5.01.25, 17:10:33] ~ Mithiran: I’ve gotten AfterPay
[5.01.25, 17:12:01] ~ Mithiran: I don’t really remember if they asked for proof of invoice. But our suppliers are from China and we got approved @⁨~Alex Lever⁩
[5.01.25, 17:14:12] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I got both. Not a problem buying from China
[5.01.25, 17:16:52] ~ Denis Mihin: Anyone knows a plug who sells ig pages with alot followers?
[5.01.25, 22:05:12] ~ Alex Lever: Ah okay, I’ll give it a try thanks
[5.01.25, 23:50:06] ~ Phil: Hey guys, 

Just to get a rough idea for people on the beauty niche. Do you all mass test or like 1 product a week because it’s more work? Just wondering if I’m spending too much time on one product test or if I should be testing way more.

Thanks
[6.01.25, 1:44:41] ~ Al: I don't think they would bro. Most suppliers are in China lol
[6.01.25, 3:56:56] ~ Guy Edan: When you test new hooks, do you change both the vid and script (of the hook) or just one of them? ‎<This message was edited>
‎[6.01.25, 4:07:25] ~ Aaron Ware: ‎image omitted
[6.01.25, 4:07:34] ~ Aaron Ware: Don’t buy accounts from this dude. Total scam.
[6.01.25, 4:23:23] ~ Twizzylit: We tried to get a credit line through him and nothing happened
[6.01.25, 4:23:34] ~ Twizzylit: He’s sus
[6.01.25, 4:23:39] ~ Twizzylit: This was in November
[6.01.25, 4:23:47] ~ Aaron Ware: Yeah bro avoid
[6.01.25, 4:24:29] ~ Twizzylit: Bros down bad
[6.01.25, 4:24:37] ~ Twizzylit: Has to pay for that Aston some how
[6.01.25, 7:56:22] ~ Brian: It depends on what kind of test you are doing.

If you know you have a winning script (copy) hook, then you can iterate on different visual hooks.

If you know a visual hook works well, you can test new script (copy) hooks with that visual.

If your ad is doing OK consistently near BE ROAS and you believe the hook can be improved, then you can do a visual & script (copy) hook change for the biggest impact.


Visual + Script (copy) hook change = biggest impact in performance

Visual hook change is usually second & Copy hook change only is third.
[6.01.25, 7:56:51] ~ Brian: When I say script hook I just mean the copy of the hook. Using your terminology here
[6.01.25, 12:57:36] ~ Mark: The way that I see it there are three elements to the hook: the copy itself (script), the video (scroll stopper), and the audio. All three of these should be split tested but their importance also follows that order. Script being the most important, video being the second most important, and audio being the third most important.
[6.01.25, 13:00:20] ~ Steve: Hook stacking is the new hook iteration.
[6.01.25, 13:00:26] ~ Steve: We're focusing on hook stacking.
[6.01.25, 13:00:39] ~ Steve: Iterations of course still but seeing better results with hook stacks
[6.01.25, 13:10:46] ~ Mark: It’s kinda crazy how much more life you can get out of a creative with hook stacking
[6.01.25, 13:10:57] ~ Mark: We’ve probably doubled our win rate with creatives with it
[6.01.25, 13:11:42] ~ Steve: yeah seeing that across the board. Inside an angle, take top 3-4 performing all time hooks, rearrange them so they make some sort of natural sense and its like extending the hook
[6.01.25, 13:11:51] ~ Steve: and then can actually iterate on the hook stack by changing the order of the stack
[6.01.25, 13:12:21] ~ Phil: Do you guys just take peoples Tik tok videos cut them up and put a script over it. I feel like I don’t know where to start with video ads and I don’t want to steal peoples content but I’m just testing. 

I found all my success with image ads so I got really no idea how to make that “winning creative” any tips?
[6.01.25, 13:15:17] ~ Mason Schulze: best thing to do is study others ads that are selling the same or similar product as yours and doing well, then with the ads you determine are winning for them download them and descript them, re-write the scripts yourself for your own product and improve, then send the product to some UGC creators and ask them to record.
[6.01.25, 13:16:15] ~ Phil: Okay, is that even if I’m just testing a product? I feel paying UGC creators for a product I havnt tested would be risky?
[6.01.25, 13:16:23] ~ Mason Schulze: dont just rip content and use it, that wont get you far.
[6.01.25, 13:16:45] ~ Mason Schulze: are others selling this product?
[6.01.25, 13:16:59] ~ Phil: Yeah I’ve got like 5 great competitors
[6.01.25, 13:17:11] ~ Mason Schulze: well then you know its a winner bro
[6.01.25, 13:17:11] ~ Phil: So many ads
[6.01.25, 13:17:17] ~ Phil: True
[6.01.25, 13:17:28] ~ Phil: So worth it getting it branded and sent to a UGC creator
[6.01.25, 13:17:35] ~ Mason Schulze: now beat them with, better ads, better branding, better website
[6.01.25, 13:17:53] ~ Phil: Yeah I’ll give it a go
[6.01.25, 13:17:54] ~ Mark: Ya this is the best way to do it imo as well, plus you can use gethookd.ai to save, download, and rescript the entire thing for you in like 30 seconds
[6.01.25, 13:18:00] ~ Phil: Appreciate it always Mason thanks for the tips
[6.01.25, 13:18:10] ~ Mason Schulze: anytime bro
[6.01.25, 13:18:18] ~ Phil: Ohh nice thanks for that
[6.01.25, 13:19:01] ~ Mason Schulze: have some conviction with the product you choose and give it good crack for a while, you can make anything work with the right marketing ‎<This message was edited>
[6.01.25, 13:19:23] ~ Phil: Yeah this product is evergreen and is going viral atm
[6.01.25, 13:26:20] ~ Alvaro De Prada: This you mean you have 4 hooks that are winners so you put them as one ad as a “super hook”?
[6.01.25, 13:32:20] ~ Steve: yep
[6.01.25, 13:35:43] ~ Brian: To speed it up if you sell their products just rip it and run. You have to be scrappy at the start then start iterating on things that do semi-decently. You're never going to get a crazy winner by ripping other peoples stuff but at least you get data at a more affordable rate for your ad account. When you find your own winner that's where the money is made
[6.01.25, 13:36:42] ~ Brian: This! Test it with as many ad concepts that you can instead of always switching products.
[6.01.25, 13:38:30] ~ Phil: Thanks for the tips guys I’ll defs take everything into consideration!!
[6.01.25, 15:32:15] ~ Jonny: Anyone here running tik tok and meta traffic to the same store? Do you notice when launching Tik Tok it seems to have an effect on meta performance?
[6.01.25, 15:47:12] ~ Gideon: After how much spend and sales you decide a testing ad is a winner and copy it to the scaling campaign?
[6.01.25, 15:54:08] ~ Lovro Knavs: There are early indicators, but i like to wait to at least 500-1000 in spend
[6.01.25, 16:08:24] ~ Gideon: Okay. Great. And just scale the testing ads until you reach that spend and when its still good and has some social proof transfer it to the scaling campaign right?
[6.01.25, 16:18:23] ~ Lovro Knavs: Yes something like that
[6.01.25, 16:47:49] ~ Arad Khazabi: hey guys, if you hire lets 10 ugc creators at once

is it normal that some of them are genuinely HORRIBLE

I received a content back of a ugc creator and like it literally looks like she put 0 effort into it, of course I asked for revisions and told her that, but still.

just wanted to ask if that's normal and if I should expect that on some
[6.01.25, 16:55:17] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: It’s probably just poor selection bro
[6.01.25, 17:03:13] ~ Lovro Knavs: Instructions for creators should be ultra specific (so you really get what u want) + selection makes a big part as well yep
[6.01.25, 20:12:06] ~ Azinco: Hello, guys! Any advice on fixing a Trustpilot score? I worked with a company, but all their reviews were deleted by Trustpilot.
[6.01.25, 20:40:24] ~ Matt: I have someone that’s had sticky reviews so far
[6.01.25, 20:40:26] ~ Matt: Real profiles
[6.01.25, 21:32:01] ~ Christian: Does anybody have resources on creative strategy research and creation as well as organization? Would very much appreciate it!
[6.01.25, 21:32:55] ~ Azinco: Can you share their info please?
[6.01.25, 21:51:52] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: Nick theriot’s course facebook ads that scale
[6.01.25, 21:53:03] ~ Ben Mansour: Do you have the course in mega file or something?
[6.01.25, 22:00:17] ~ Austin: Is anybody having issues with facebook ads library today ?
[6.01.25, 22:07:40] ~ Mert M: yes
[6.01.25, 22:22:37] ~ Christian: Thanks!
[6.01.25, 22:28:03] ~ Ben Mansour: Our winning ad has been running since 4 months now and it got rejected today, does it mean that someone reported it?
[6.01.25, 22:56:23] Alex  Fedotoff: just get it preapproved again, potentially AI Flagged it
[6.01.25, 22:56:36] Alex  Fedotoff: there are people that can have it preapproved for oyu
[6.01.25, 22:56:44] Alex  Fedotoff: let me know if you want intro
[6.01.25, 23:12:45] ~ Brian: If you use Triplewhale you can tell by switching from TA (Triple Attribution) to FC (First Click). If it's affecting META you should see the FC NCROAS rise for Tik Tok. But honestly if you're just starting out with TT than I wouldn't even worry about uplift here, it will be BARELY (if at all) noticeable. META can bring you a very long way.
[6.01.25, 23:17:48] ~ Brian: After 3-4 days, with consistent spend & ncroas. As long as the creative looks decent, I'll dupe it into our scale campaigns. We use bid cap campaigns so I have less worry on FB blowing budget on ads that don't work without hitting target CPA.

Main thing you are trying to find are

1. NCROAS that is at or above your target
2. Consistent performance over time (days)
3. Spends enough for the data to give you these signals
‎[6.01.25, 23:19:14] ~ Brian: ‎image omitted
[6.01.25, 23:19:27] ~ Charles: How much you spending a day with bid caps?
[6.01.25, 23:20:57] ~ Brian: During Q4, about 20k/d
[6.01.25, 23:21:12] ~ Charles: Solid
[6.01.25, 23:21:12] ~ Brian: For one account, one campaign. Not including others
[6.01.25, 23:21:39] ~ Charles: You’re running multiples ad account?
[6.01.25, 23:24:19] ~ Jonny: Yeah we’re scaling on FB steadily. Currently at around $7-9k/day spend but want to diversify traffic sources.
[6.01.25, 23:25:04] ~ Brian: Depends on what you're trying to do.

If you're trying to shotgun it and give more freedom to creators than yes the content might be shit.

I like to be more specific on the script + b-rolls the creator should be doing because we are the people that understand DR marketing VS the creators.

Are you asking for just content alone? (Or with filming?) How many b-roll clips did you ask for, was it specific in the ask where you did screenshots of the visuals you want. The script also needs to be specific on what you want.
[6.01.25, 23:25:23] ~ Brian: For different brands yes
[6.01.25, 23:25:42] ~ Brian: Only in rare cases for the same brand, we'll use multiple ad accounts. The fb algo is smart enough ‎<This message was edited>
[6.01.25, 23:27:40] ~ Brian: What about Google? There's a lot of scale (and very consistent) compared to the other channels that are not META
[6.01.25, 23:28:03] ~ Brian: Non-brand search, and demand gen can bring you quite far
[6.01.25, 23:29:54] ~ Jonny: Tik toks our priority right now. Can’t get explosive growth with Google like you can on Tik tok.
[6.01.25, 23:41:38] ~ Brian: I don't know any of the big brands that can run TT consistently lookin into their Ad accounts and speaking to others. But maybe you know others that have done it. Unless you're talking about TT Shop?
[6.01.25, 23:41:47] ~ Brian: What industry btw
[6.01.25, 23:41:57] ~ Brian: Supplements?
[7.01.25, 0:03:17] ~ Gideon: Where do you put your bidcap? At target cpa? Lets say at your aov?
[7.01.25, 0:06:51] ~ Brian: Put it at the FB reported CPA that your winning ad is getting or slightly higher so it starts spending. Then start coasting it down if needed, or increasing if you want to scale and can afford a higher CPA. No set rules because there's a lot of nuance to bidcap management.
[7.01.25, 2:05:23] ~ Charles: Anyone have experience here with Snowball and do you recommend?
[7.01.25, 5:04:56] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys what is the usual salary for a creative strategist? 

Scripting, communicating with actors, managing video editors.

How do you compensate? Does anyone pay bonuses if an ad they make does well?
[7.01.25, 5:19:40] ~ Brian: Depends on what country they live in. Also whether you are hiring for experience or raw IQ that you can train up.

E.g. EU creative strategist 1.5-4k base + comp. US would be more as you would expect.
[7.01.25, 5:27:44] ~ Mithiran: Thanks for sharing! How do bonuses typically work for you? Like, how much do you usually offer, and is it based on ad performance metrics like ROAS or revenue?
[7.01.25, 8:56:12] ~ Yente Dhooge: Our guy can't do ad approvals anymore, can you intro us as well please? Thanks! 🙏
[7.01.25, 9:54:52] ~ Henry: Can you also intro me as well? Same problem happening to one of our winning ads
[7.01.25, 10:22:51] ~ Brian: % of rev-spend. Anything closest to the profit of the business but also not a nightmare to calculate at the EOM
[7.01.25, 10:23:28] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes please!
[7.01.25, 11:34:35] ~ Matt: Hey guys what are your thoughts on this issue for a newer account on low spend, cpa targets were being hit so I increased spend by £10 a day for 3 days. Started at £100 on the Monday, ended at £130 on the Wednesday. 

CAC still held so increased again by 20% to £156 on Friday evening and then on the Saturday the metrics just dumped. 

No changes to website were made and checkouts are working from what I can see too.

Monday- Friday metrics:
CPA: £37
Cost per add to cart: £21.32
CTR 0.91%
CPM: 9.02
Cost per checkout:£11

Saturday to Monday metrics:
CPA: 153
Cost per add to cart: £35
CTR: 1%
CPM: 10.40
Cost per checkout: £51

Let me know thoughts on how you would trouble shoot this? Thanks 🤝
[7.01.25, 11:37:40] ~ Phil: Why don’t you bump 20%. Is there a reason for bumping only $10
[7.01.25, 11:38:24] ~ Matt: Not really no but when I did bump 20% metrics dumped
[7.01.25, 11:38:48] ~ Phil: And all days are different. At such a low spend it can be inconsistent I saw with mine too but once I reach over $500 a day ad spend and above became really consistent
[7.01.25, 11:38:49] ~ Matt: So I guess for the week it was bumped 50% total over 4 days which from experience shouldn’t cause such a dump
[7.01.25, 11:39:10] ~ Phil: Yeah maybe wait to see what the others say
[7.01.25, 11:39:30] ~ Phil: Monday and Tuesday where always really low days for me
[7.01.25, 11:45:08] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I would say do higher bumps and keep enhancing the offer. going slow wouldn't make the product work. and some productsor creatives do work for a few days but if bumping gets them down, one day can be incosnsistent but for more then it is issue of creatives or offer or smt in the funnel.
‎[7.01.25, 13:06:29] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: ‎video omitted
[7.01.25, 13:13:31] ~ Ateeb Shahdhar: Looks amazing, someone let us know how
[7.01.25, 13:17:45] ~ Matt: Custom coded, Javy coffee started doing this
[7.01.25, 13:18:42] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Ahh shit lol I'm just doing kaching + slapping images but can't do gifts for quantity this way so...
[7.01.25, 13:20:46] ~ Steve: doesn’t have to be custom coded, you can build this sort of thing in replo
‎[7.01.25, 13:23:14] ~ Steve: ‎image omitted
[7.01.25, 13:23:41] ~ Steve: our new website will have this option as well, havent worked out all the gifts images yet, but they pop up with a nice little graphic when you click on the different offers
[7.01.25, 13:24:06] ~ Steve: still little more work to do, but we just had someone design in figma and then guy build it in replo
[7.01.25, 13:25:17] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hmm never tried replo yet but will look into it, used to use gempages. Do you think is there any way I can just design this offer section and import it? ‎<This message was edited>
[7.01.25, 13:25:32] ~ Steve: Replo is same as gempages essentially
[7.01.25, 13:25:39] ~ Steve: shopify app that allows you to build pages
[7.01.25, 13:26:50] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Also I have one question if you don't mind, how much your supplier quoted you for the frother? 
I'm selling something in tea too and my supplier told me just around 5$ for this frother
[7.01.25, 13:27:03] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: True thanks bro I'll look into it
[7.01.25, 13:28:24] ~ Steve: not entirely sure yet, its a placeholder, we’re stll working out gifts
[7.01.25, 13:28:31] ~ Steve: but less than $5 for sure, $5 would be too much
[7.01.25, 13:28:46] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Exactly that's what I said
[7.01.25, 13:29:05] ~ Steve: we’re still working out what gifts will be on our offers, our margin on the supp is phenomenal so we can afford some sort of gift
[7.01.25, 14:58:57] ~ Zsombor: I dm-d you as well brother
[7.01.25, 15:23:26] ~ Yente Dhooge: Would downscale a bit again & test new creatives
[7.01.25, 17:35:59] ~ Matt: Any alternatives to using platforms like incense that have good creators for ugc style ads?
[7.01.25, 22:24:37] ~ Austin: Who’s utalizing AI ad actors successfully? I’m using Arcad and doing very well, would love to learn / share if anyone’s interested in connecting.
[7.01.25, 22:55:41] ~ Yusuf: Anyone uses a Shopify app/ software to work with multiple suppliers at the same time? I'm looking for an app to randomly assign orders between my two suppliers. Before making full switch, I want to test how it goes with the new supplier
[7.01.25, 22:58:19] ~ Phil: Service Points
[7.01.25, 22:58:23] ~ Phil: Search them up on Google
[7.01.25, 22:59:58] ~ Yusuf: Thanks
[7.01.25, 23:07:12] ~ Matt: Anyone got a top tier cold traffic landing page designer or agency they can recommend in supplement niche?
[7.01.25, 23:29:16] ~ Giorgos: Copywriter is what you really need tho
[8.01.25, 0:06:14] ~ Twizzylit: I’m running on basic shrine theme with section store and printing 50k days with supps
[8.01.25, 0:11:47] ~ NeuroCup: with VSLs?
[8.01.25, 0:16:42] ~ Twizzylit: Nah
[8.01.25, 0:16:52] ~ Twizzylit: Working on prelanders
[8.01.25, 0:29:31] ~ Omar: U put the vsl on the lander ?
[8.01.25, 0:33:30] ~ Twizzylit: No VSL
[8.01.25, 0:34:09] ~ NeuroCup: advertorial or listicle style?
[8.01.25, 0:35:32] ~ Twizzylit: Personal story
[8.01.25, 0:35:40] ~ Twizzylit: Listicle don’t really work for us
[8.01.25, 1:31:35] ~ Guy Edan: Is the story on the Shopify product page? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.01.25, 1:35:29] ~ Guy Edan: Oh I misunderstood. I thought  I read no advertorial. Do you use adverts or directly to product page? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.01.25, 9:08:52] ~ Matt: Nice what sort of funnel you running and offer?
[8.01.25, 9:09:34] ~ Matt: My best performer is a long form sales page similar to primal queen style
[8.01.25, 9:11:01] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yoo boss here I know a few people including me who are trying to achieve this please help us with some of your advices on how you pick the products and test, do you mainly get tiktok shop products? How did you do your test creatives, and other steps bro it would be helpful for us
[8.01.25, 9:30:03] ~ Phil: Yeah I’d love that
[8.01.25, 13:04:33] ~ Jonny: what do you guys do if your CBO's performance dips quite a lot? They've been performing great for a while but past 2-3 days performance has dropped on those campaigns
[8.01.25, 13:05:39] ~ Ry: I have the same issue this 2 days for my asc. Wondering as well
[8.01.25, 13:06:29] ~ M A N U E L: Same but today looks like it went back to good performance
[8.01.25, 13:17:00] ~ Nal: Does anybody here know any apps or ways we can make a questionnaire as a prelander page? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.01.25, 13:26:57] ~ Matt: I’ve used involve.me which worked well
[8.01.25, 14:26:14] ~ Nal: Will have a look thanks
[8.01.25, 14:35:05] ~ Jonny: when testing new products, do you typically test with broad audience or interests?
[8.01.25, 14:57:38] ~ Mark: I usually split test both, but broad usually works better, even on a fresh pixel
[8.01.25, 15:03:29] ~ M A N U E L: always broad
[8.01.25, 15:05:22] ~ Dr Zied: Kindly could you share, How many broad adsets you test?
[8.01.25, 15:17:19] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Can anyone here share their post purchase email flow (in general) to upsell more products and get reviews?
[8.01.25, 15:32:50] ~ Mark: I had a dev custom code one for me, cost like $50, worth every penny it works flawlessly and loads super fast

[8.01.25, 21:26:33] ~ Tom: Hey Matthew!
[8.01.25, 21:30:46] ~ Matthew Martorano: Hey Tom
[8.01.25, 21:38:55] ~ Kyle Twohill: Is there any way to get shopify currency conversion fees down? Its a pretty high fee any time I get an order outside the USA added onto the fee I already pay
[8.01.25, 21:45:29] ~ Matthew Martorano: Is their fee a % of conversion?
[8.01.25, 21:46:34] ~ Kyle Twohill: yeah I think they charge an additional 1.5% on top of processing fees
[8.01.25, 22:03:31] ~ Caesar: From your experience, would you say it's worth it to sell a lifetime warranty on items which don't make logical sense to do it on? 

For example on Amazon if you buy a neck pillow they wont offer lifetime warranty, whereas if you buy a vacuum it will offer it.
[8.01.25, 22:10:43] ~ Charles: Yes! Doesnt make sense really for us and 75% of people are taking it. 10% of our product price
[8.01.25, 22:14:26] ~ Matthew Martorano: I frankly don’t understand that. We do dynamic currency conversion for our clients at no additional cost. It doesn’t make sense to me if they want the sales volume.
[8.01.25, 22:24:09] ~ Davide: Do you have the warranty in post purchase upsell? Order bump? 
75% is really good, do you mean the cost of the warranty is 10% of your product price?
[8.01.25, 22:24:31] ~ Caesar: awesome insights brother, thank you! 🙏
[8.01.25, 22:24:44] ~ Caesar: Order bump is what i was referring to brother, so im afraid it may cause friction. ‎<This message was edited>
[8.01.25, 22:25:13] ~ Charles: Order bump, right under my ATC. Yes 10% of my product price
[8.01.25, 22:30:33] ~ Guy Edan: When you launch a new product/brand and it’s not moving well, how much time and money do you give it before deciding it’s not a good one and moving forward? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.01.25, 22:30:54] ~ Davide: Interesting, can I ask you what’s niche are you in if I don’t mind you?
[8.01.25, 22:31:20] ~ Ben Mansour: 150$ cbo, and pump creatives everyday videos/statics
[8.01.25, 22:31:29] ~ Ben Mansour: For 30 days
[8.01.25, 22:31:53] ~ Ben Mansour: You should see some sales in first days, but it‘s ok if not profitable

[8.01.25, 23:39:54] ~ Brian: Hey Matt! Was checking out checkoutchamp recently actually.

Are you guys able to do highly custom upsells for Shopify stores?
[8.01.25, 23:45:57] ~ Brian: How much spend have you put behind it?
[8.01.25, 23:47:07] ~ Guy Edan: About $2-3k, pretty much at breakeven
[8.01.25, 23:47:09] ~ Matthew Martorano: Yes, fully customized high converting checkout pages with pre-purchase order bumps, and fully customized upsell and downsells.
[8.01.25, 23:50:57] ~ Matthew Martorano: And if you’re looking to get off of stripe, we have 270 gateways and banks you can connect to.
[8.01.25, 23:56:45] ~ Jonny: +1 for checkout champ. The platform is dope. Bumped our AOV by 17% with post purchase upsells and CVR stayed the same compared with Shopify.
[8.01.25, 23:57:30] ~ Matthew Martorano: Here’s a good example of a native checkout replacement on Shopify. https://queenstrands.com
[9.01.25, 0:09:46] ~ Davide: Looks very solid🔥
[9.01.25, 0:11:23] ~ Davide: The dashboard for reporting data is more specific then Funnelish for example in checkout champ?
[9.01.25, 0:13:02] ~ Matthew Martorano: Yes and we’re building out a more analytical dashboard right now. We have to. Most of our clients have hundreds of store and sales sites so we have to provide greater detail.
[9.01.25, 0:36:01] ~ Davide: Definitely I’ll take a look! Thanks man
[9.01.25, 0:50:19] ~ Aaron Ware: We just signed up!
[9.01.25, 0:51:04] ~ Matthew Martorano: Welcome. Engage with your AM and they’ll get you rolling fast.
[9.01.25, 1:33:59] ~ Brian: Breakeven is great if just starting. You haven't even found the best creative, lps or offers for the product yet. Keep testing and you'll eventually find one that kills it and you can keep raising budgets without ROAS drop. That's how you get it to move well to answer your question. Lmk if that helps
[9.01.25, 1:36:25] ~ Brian: can we hop on a call? brand does about 1mil/m. have a couple questions on pre-purchase and then to post-purchase flows while using checkoutchamp
[9.01.25, 1:37:06] ~ Andrea: On the bottom of your CRM there is a calendly link for your account manager

[9.01.25, 7:48:32] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone know of any apps that can copy a entire landing page into Gempages
[9.01.25, 8:01:56] ~ Nick Jansen: Look for website scraping videos on YouTube, lot of AI program that can do this
[9.01.25, 9:11:16] ~ Brian: Funnelish can help you clone prelanders pages exactly the way you want it
[9.01.25, 9:12:58] ~ Brian: If you're getting consistent BE ROAS on META, I would work on dialing in your CRO. So testing new offers to raise RPU (Revenue Per User).

So your BE will become slightly profitable even with the same ads.
[9.01.25, 9:13:24] ~ Brian: If not just work on more ad creative till you get something consistent
[9.01.25, 9:48:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I want a advice. right now testing TikTok shop supplements. how many creatives and angles yall suggest to start the test with? right now I am doing 7 for the day one and leave it for 2 days and if I see product is getting break even or metrics are good but cpcs are high third day new batch of creatives and it fixes it so far.
[9.01.25, 10:12:27] ~ Arad Khazabi: what do you guys do if you hire a ugc creator, and on the first try shes extremely horrible and after asking for a revisions, the revisions are still horrible - do you guys give up at this point on that individual ugc creator?
[9.01.25, 10:13:41] ~ Ry: Yeah just give up. Its not worth your time. Get a refund if u can.
[9.01.25, 10:13:59] ~ Arad Khazabi: as we used email to communicate and i pay her after the work is done, should I simply just explain her X reasons why obviously she was extremely lazy to put proper effort into the content and that's why we do not pay you? ‎<This message was edited>
[9.01.25, 10:15:58] ~ Arad Khazabi: never hired ugc per email thats why am asking, and just to send out the product to her cost an additional $150
[9.01.25, 10:16:00] ~ Ry: Yes or just stop communication with her
[9.01.25, 10:16:07] ~ Arad Khazabi: okay then. thanks
[9.01.25, 10:16:31] ~ Ry: Alot of these kind of creators. Just not worth the effort to go back and forth
[9.01.25, 10:16:45] ~ Ry: Good ones get it on the first try
[9.01.25, 10:16:51] ~ Arad Khazabi: yes i mean
[9.01.25, 10:17:04] ~ Arad Khazabi: i did ask even on the best ones like the slightest revisions
[9.01.25, 10:17:10] ~ Arad Khazabi: but you clearly can see teh difference wether its good or bad
[9.01.25, 10:17:26] ~ Arad Khazabi: this specific creator it even looks like that she was pissed doing that content.
[9.01.25, 13:10:42] ~ N: Anyone used grid bank to get content
[9.01.25, 13:15:14] ~ Steve: yep
[9.01.25, 13:15:28] ~ Steve: making all our video editors use stuff from there rather than just stock and rather than AI
[9.01.25, 13:15:54] ~ Steve: avoiding using any AI in our VSLs
[9.01.25, 13:16:14] ~ Steve: 100% our own shot footage is the goal + UGC shot footage from creators. Gridbank stuff can help fill gap
[9.01.25, 13:20:02] ~ N: Yeah avoiding all the obvious stock videos
[9.01.25, 13:20:21] ~ N: Eleven labs voice + grid bank
[9.01.25, 13:20:22] ~ Steve: i’ll use the stock videos before the ai videos tbh
[9.01.25, 13:20:41] ~ N: U mean that Ai character stuff
[9.01.25, 13:21:07] ~ Steve: i voice over all our scripts myself, for female voice I will use some eleven labs with a tempo changing tool i have to make it sound real

But prefer voice actors when I can
[9.01.25, 13:21:21] ~ Steve: I mean any AI stuff
[9.01.25, 13:21:42] ~ N: Why not eleven labs they got some realistic voices
[9.01.25, 13:21:47] ~ N: A massive library of them
[9.01.25, 13:21:59] ~ Steve: i dont want to use that in my brand, faacebook gonna be slapping it anyways. if you’re running 100% AI shit facebook is gonna slap you
[9.01.25, 13:22:21] ~ Steve: eleven labs is great, but as a brand we’re moving towards real, authentic content for everything we can as policy
[9.01.25, 13:22:29] ~ N: Fair enough
[9.01.25, 13:22:30] ~ Steve: 1-2 video shoots/photo shoots a month in 2025
[9.01.25, 13:22:55] ~ Steve: but i hope everyone else keeps using AI 100% of the time lol
[9.01.25, 13:23:05] ~ Steve: will make it so much easier for real authentic content in ads to stand out
[9.01.25, 13:23:21] ~ N: Tbh bro u can’t even tell what voice is Ai and real
[9.01.25, 13:23:29] ~ Steve: FB can
[9.01.25, 13:23:30] ~ N: I seen real voice overs hard to tell
[9.01.25, 13:23:39] ~ Steve: and theyre gonna slap it over time
[9.01.25, 13:23:43] ~ N: Yeah but what happens u seen a difference in cpm?
[9.01.25, 13:23:44] ~ Steve: RIP to your CPMs
[9.01.25, 13:23:49] ~ Steve: you’re gonna
[9.01.25, 13:24:01] ~ N: Interesting ain’t heard that before
[9.01.25, 13:24:07] ~ N: Where did u see this
[9.01.25, 13:24:38] ~ Steve: been discussing with with several other brand owners, FB people I’m connected to
[9.01.25, 13:24:57] ~ Steve: its coming. and its obvious. FB doesn’t want its timeline flooded with non stop AI video and audio
[9.01.25, 13:26:37] ~ Steve: not saying you can’t make money with it, go for it.

I want to focus on building a large brand over time. real custom stories, real influencers, real creators being used in ads that feel more authentic and real overall
[9.01.25, 13:27:45] ~ Steve: i see way too many people jumping through 15 hoops to use gimmicks and tricks. Fake comments, fake stories, fake testimonials, this trick, that trick etc etc instead of just doing the hard work building real products that help people
[9.01.25, 13:28:01] ~ Steve: its the harder path but you build something more worthwhile and i’d rather focus on that anyways
[9.01.25, 13:47:39] ~ Brian: @⁨~Steve⁩ speaking the truth here 🔥
[9.01.25, 13:48:43] ~ Brian: I'm also curious how FB moving to community notes is going to affect Ads vs their current fact check team. I swear anything fake is going to be community noted to hell 😂
[9.01.25, 13:50:51] ~ Steve: i mean, its not where my brand is today tbh. Right now we’re trying to blast through stock of a product we think is pretty crap so we can sell the stock of the new upgraded product we know is better ASAP.

But in 2025 our plan is to:
- Get custom product made with patent, our Industrial designer has already 3D printed our custom molds
- ⁠Launch 2 other lines of products to go with the new flagship product
- ⁠map our influencer/creator marketing channels (prob go with agency to help here
- ⁠See if we can find a C or D level athelete that we can afford to come on as a brand ambassador

Definitely a long term plan, but have to start somewhere
[9.01.25, 13:51:12] ~ Omar: whens the community notes comming
[9.01.25, 13:51:24] ~ Omar: i see twitter shitting on ads saying this product from ali express
[9.01.25, 13:51:41] ~ Steve: Bro twitter already community notes dropshipper ads as “this is a deceptive marketing tactic dropshipping brands use to trick customers into buying products that may not do what they are advertised to do”
[9.01.25, 13:51:51] ~ Steve: if Meta starts doing that……LMFAO so many people are fucked
[9.01.25, 13:52:40] ~ Steve: twitter also marks ads as AI generated too with a community note “this appears to be an AI generated video/image”
[9.01.25, 13:56:36] ~ Steve: Dana White is now on the board of advisors to Zuckerberg - its not hard to see where FB is gonna try and go. Zuck wants to be Musk now
[9.01.25, 13:59:35] ~ Brian: Love this. I find the higher the business gets they always set these type of Q1-Q4 goals in the beginning of the year or EOY last year and execute like crazy. Good you have a plan!
[9.01.25, 14:00:21] ~ Brian: Hahahah dam its going to happen on META then
[9.01.25, 14:00:48] ~ Brian: We'll find a way as always 😄
[9.01.25, 14:02:59] ~ Omar: There’s always something about this stuff to put off ecom ppl
[9.01.25, 14:55:19] ~ Mark: facts
[9.01.25, 14:56:10] ~ Mark: I think all the platforms are just moving closer to eliminating every little shortcut and hack that dropshippers love to use lol
[9.01.25, 15:05:09] ~ Steve: i agree

And its why I ask myself “what are they all shortcutting?” and the answer is, they’re trying to shortcut building a real brand
[9.01.25, 15:05:41] ~ Steve: ironically when you start doing stuff like better products, helping your customers, improving your content, etc etc - you end up needed less and less of the hacks and gimmicks
[9.01.25, 15:42:53] ~ Matthew Martorano: I agree with Steve. We service thousands of big brands and the most successful brands do not short cut anything. They use real copy writers, and have video designers, and have in-house media buying teams.
[9.01.25, 15:50:17] ~ Growg: 100% Agree here with Matthew & Steve. 

Big Brand/People with Potential of building good brands understands basic fundamentals clearly and does execution 100x without Cost cutting. That helps them in long run whereas Dropshipper/Newbiew has this issue.
[9.01.25, 15:55:00] ~ Matthew Martorano: We’re going to be going over all of this in the 4 part masterclass we are starting next week. It’s on zoom and any of you are welcome to join and learn some new techniques. https://ecm.checkoutchamp.com
[9.01.25, 16:16:55] ~ NeuroCup: I’m just starting with funnelish, anyone has a good funnel template to share?
[9.01.25, 16:32:53] ~ Mithiran: Yeah i bought a nooro one for like $400 bucks for funnelish. Dont mind sharing if u want
[9.01.25, 16:32:58] ~ Mithiran: @⁨~NeuroCup⁩
[9.01.25, 16:37:51] ~ Lovro Knavs: @⁨~Mithiran⁩ sent u a dm
[9.01.25, 20:25:33] ~ Alexander Sundström: Anyone in the Europe markets, we have been seeing terrible performance over the last week, it has never been this bad. It could be many different factors. I just wanted to check if there has been a change or if we are just sucking at the moment.

Cpm is lower than ever and everything works fine on Shopify.
[9.01.25, 20:26:14] ~ Omar: u running vsls in europe
[9.01.25, 20:29:37] ~ Caesar: No, on the contrary, insanely good performance, very low CPMs indeed
[9.01.25, 20:38:56] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: We have insane performance as well for beauty/health

[9.01.25, 21:26:33] ~ Alexander Sundström: yes
[9.01.25, 21:27:29] ~ Alexander Sundström: we changed the theme after a revamp, could that have been lost since then?
[9.01.25, 22:02:31] ~ Phil: What’s the best auto converting currency app you guys are using at the moment. I’ve had a few and a lot stuff with up with my theme for some reason. Thanks in advance
[9.01.25, 22:50:16] ~ Davide: What’s the best brand that is crushing running static ads in your opinion?
[10.01.25, 0:40:08] ~ Wouter: What countries?
[10.01.25, 0:57:20] ~ Brian: Check your event history, are purchases even being tracked?
[10.01.25, 0:57:49] ~ Alexander Sundström: It says 9,6/10
[10.01.25, 0:58:02] ~ Alexander Sundström: In events manager
[10.01.25, 0:58:14] ~ Brian: Thats okay then
[10.01.25, 0:58:15] ~ Alexander Sundström: It might be a bug, now it is not showing anymore
[10.01.25, 0:58:38] ~ Brian: Did you do any big changes recently
[10.01.25, 0:58:57] ~ Alexander Sundström: Change the theme
[10.01.25, 0:59:18] ~ Brian: When you changed the theme, did performance tank?
[10.01.25, 0:59:24] ~ Alexander Sundström: Yes
[10.01.25, 0:59:31] ~ Brian: When did you change the theme and when did performance stop working
[10.01.25, 0:59:46] ~ Alexander Sundström: When changing the theme
[10.01.25, 1:01:12] ~ Kyle Twohill: Scaling really hard right now, keep maxing my Amex cards should I apply for a credit line with fb? Or just pay it down when it maxes all the time
‎[10.01.25, 1:02:09] ~ Brian: ‎image omitted
[10.01.25, 1:02:20] ~ Brian: Because it should definitely be a theme change issue like something broke.
[10.01.25, 1:02:32] ~ Brian: check this graph basically in events manager
[10.01.25, 1:02:54] ~ Alexander Sundström: I will check now
[10.01.25, 1:05:09] ~ Alexander Sundström: I can’t track back longer than when I changed the theme
[10.01.25, 1:06:54] ~ Alexander Sundström: Does that mean I have been running on a different pixel even though it has the same name?
[10.01.25, 1:07:01] ~ Erne: Are you sure you’re still using the same pixel?
[10.01.25, 1:07:18] ~ Alexander Sundström: It has the same name
[10.01.25, 1:08:30] ~ Erne: But that’s weird

[10.01.25, 1:11:01] ~ Brian: we can get it solved
[10.01.25, 2:03:11] ~ Caesar: Had this show up too man, i think bug
[10.01.25, 9:15:24] ~ Timotej: Whats your preferred platform to get content creators for EU market?
[10.01.25, 9:18:40] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey guys, what have you found the best format of Advertourial pages to be?

I've just started running one that starts with a customer review video, then customer review story and finishing further down the page with CTAs and more sales pitch and information talking from the brands voice and its doing exceptional well! 

What are some other formats that work well?
[10.01.25, 9:21:29] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys how do you track your profit? through an app or excel sheets?

Currently using triplewhale, but there's a lot of issues with our shipping cost
[10.01.25, 9:22:29] ~ Timotej: RedTrack + Custom reporting 
--
[10.01.25, 9:31:16] ~ Growg: Here is the format which my copywriter wrote for other brands- I really liked the formatting & indepth research, just making it simple would have been great - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJh1JnAICjVDZZRmjJlXin299ugCBS7oJjT_-8p6x6o/edit

I think this can help you.
[10.01.25, 9:39:32] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Profit calc for quick overview and bookkeeper with Finaloop for banking

[10.01.25, 10:01:27] ~ Adonis A: I believe the Supreme Court has to make a decision today. Fingers crossed lol. Getting ready to launch in the uk just in case
[10.01.25, 10:50:45] ~ Mithiran: When price split testing, what metric do you guys look at? Is it profit per click?
[10.01.25, 11:33:28] ~ Andrea: The absolutely horrid looking listicles pull 50+% CVR
[10.01.25, 11:35:05] ~ Ben Mansour: Revenue per visitor
[10.01.25, 11:42:22] ~ Andrea: Also profit per visitor when looking at offers specifically
[10.01.25, 11:42:33] ~ Brian: Revenue per visitor. You can have 20% increase in CVR but still lower results because they are all converting on the cheaper offer
[10.01.25, 11:43:27] Topi: Yes 100%, also it can affect upsell take rates. We just saw this. 20 USD difference in AOV
[10.01.25, 11:44:42] Topi: Offer A had 6x free gifts, offer B 3x free gifts. Offer A converted slightly more but B had $20 higher AOV. Exactly looking at revenue per visitor or “EPC” how we call it, we figured out the winner
[10.01.25, 11:45:55] ~ Matt: I’ve noticed that too lol, can make something look amazing with great copy but some scammy looking listicle or advertorial works better 🤦🏻‍♂️
[10.01.25, 11:46:08] ~ Maxi: Also in addition to the split testing here I would strongly suggest keeping test as long as possible to validate the data 100%

Way too often picking a winner too early because results seem to promising in first 10 days can be a big problem later down the line
[10.01.25, 11:47:05] ~ Andrea: Yeah this applies for all pages. I'm not 100% sure about the psychology behind it but I suspect it's about not overly distracting the customer with fancy design and colors
[10.01.25, 11:47:58] ~ Matt: Yh some I’m surprised anyone buys from it at scale as they look so dated but clearly work, I think older buyers too it works better with
[10.01.25, 14:07:51] ~ Mark: Ugly pages = pretty profits
[10.01.25, 14:08:27] ~ Mason Schulze: This is interesting, any theory behind this
[10.01.25, 14:08:40] ~ Mason Schulze: Because I've been trying to make my ultra professional
[10.01.25, 14:09:27] ~ Mark: It’s not a hard rule, but I’ve noticed when you try to make the most aesthetically pleasing landers, they fail when split tested against a bare bones ugly lander.
[10.01.25, 14:09:32] ~ Andrea: Well we know for copy that the more complicated and scientific you try to sound the less it reaches/resonates with the customer. It's not far fetched to say it applies to design as well
[10.01.25, 14:09:43] ~ Ben Mansour: Guys i recently launched an advertorial with gempages, but the klaviyo email pop up appears there, anyone knows how to only keep it in product page?
[10.01.25, 14:10:01] ~ Mark: My reasoning is simplicity scales, and when you’re trying to make ur lander look like the mona lisa it’s just confusing to the prospect
[10.01.25, 14:10:22] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh fair enough makes sense
[10.01.25, 14:10:37] ~ Mark: The same is true for ads oftentimes
[10.01.25, 14:10:50] ~ Mason Schulze: In klayvio you can exclude URLs
[10.01.25, 14:11:05] ~ Mark: In fact I’ve told one of my editors on multiple occasions to make an ad look WORSE to see if it improves the profitability lol
[10.01.25, 14:11:11] ~ Mason Schulze: Targeting > exclusions
[10.01.25, 14:11:18] ~ Ben Mansour: Didn‘t know, thank you!

[10.01.25, 14:48:35] ~ Matthew Martorano: Yes, we do bundling and it’s highly flexible and easy to use.
[10.01.25, 14:49:42] ~ Mithiran: Cool, does it sync to shopify for each product SKU that is in the bundle?
[10.01.25, 14:50:25] ~ Matthew Martorano: Yes, it does. It syncs both ways. Products, SKUs, Variants, descriptions, and it sends sales back into Shopify

Thanks in advance
[10.01.25, 17:43:15] ~ Arad Khazabi: anybody advanced / has simply knowledge here in klavyio?

[10.01.25, 18:03:42] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Sort of the same as USA in terms of claims. 

But you can ask chatgpt what you can and cannot do.
[10.01.25, 18:04:52] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I'm starting the same niche but as supplement. And that is more tricky because you need to make sure your ingredients are allowed, and also register with the Ministry of Health in some countries
[10.01.25, 18:06:28] ~ Matthew Martorano: Sam Saifi is a Klaviyo king
[10.01.25, 18:08:45] ~ Growg: Got it bro! Just wanted to be sure of legal angle if any as USA market doesn’t have much hurdle but I heard EU market has got few legal angle specifically in Health, Suppellement and wellness category
[10.01.25, 18:14:38] ~ Alvaro De Prada: ChatGPT is your best bet in terms of what you can do. Keep in mind that USA actually has a lot of shit you cannot do, people just don't care but companies get sued every day because of it, you just gotta be big enough. EU is sort of the same stuff. Don't say you cure cancer if you don't. Push it to the limit but always ask ChatGPT if you crossed the line
[10.01.25, 18:19:32] ~ Denis Mihin: Should I have this message at the bottom:

In EU I don't think so
[10.01.25, 18:21:54] ~ Landon: I use Triple Whale. You can setup shipping zones.
[10.01.25, 18:22:00] ~ Denis Mihin: What exactly gets you in trouble? False promises on the lander, creatives or your marketing/messaging in general
[10.01.25, 18:23:10] ~ Matt: With uk & pets people are getting taken down now for any mention of a medical term even something like ‘supports inflammation’
[10.01.25, 18:23:23] ~ Matt: All the big brands have watered down their copy as a result
[10.01.25, 18:23:48] ~ Denis Mihin: Who takes them down? Facebook or legal authorities?
[10.01.25, 18:24:13] ~ Matt: It’s like a vetinary medical board that reports to Facebook
[10.01.25, 18:24:28] ~ Matt: I know a brand that had to take all its ads down
[10.01.25, 18:24:28] ~ Steve: inflammation + chronic = two words that gonna get you slapped this year
[10.01.25, 18:24:30] ~ Steve: especially on your pages
[10.01.25, 18:24:55] ~ Matt: Yh I’ve removed all mentions of it now just in case meta says it’s a health brand
[10.01.25, 18:25:03] ~ Denis Mihin: Noted
[10.01.25, 18:25:39] ~ Denis Mihin: When will they do that restriction for health brands
[10.01.25, 18:25:50] ~ Matt: 🤷‍♂️
[10.01.25, 18:26:43] ~ Matthew Martorano: One thing to suggest is make sure that above your submit button for payment (not below), you have the “by clicking below you are agreeing to our terms of service and privacy policy” and make sure that you have them linked. You can have your disclaimer in the TOS.
[10.01.25, 18:26:43] ~ Matt: You can’t even use the word ‘relieve’ for pets now in uk
[10.01.25, 18:26:54] ~ Matt: There’s a big doc I was sent and it’s stupid stuff
[10.01.25, 18:27:30] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Can you share?
[10.01.25, 18:28:04] ~ Growg: Tbh, Its quite good if someone claims somethings in Health like Solving NCD or Chronic Patient and in reality they are selling some nutrient from the book of Ayurveda . 
Its scam so should be flagged. This can be eventually benefit who are genuinely solving problem and product is PMF
[10.01.25, 18:30:12] ~ Matt: Yh I’m trying to find it

[10.01.25, 18:30:46] ~ Denis Mihin: I agree
[10.01.25, 18:30:59] ~ Matt: You can’t even say ‘allergy’ lol
[10.01.25, 18:31:25] ~ Matt: Anything that’s ’medical by presentation’
[10.01.25, 18:31:58] ~ Alvaro De Prada: GOAT
[10.01.25, 18:34:15] ~ Growg: Hard time for copywriter now. All the buzz word has totally restricted it seems
[10.01.25, 18:34:40] ~ Matt: This is specifically pets btw but probably same guidance applies to other human products
[10.01.25, 18:34:44] ~ Matt: And UK
[10.01.25, 18:34:50] ~ Matt: Not sure if there’s similar in US
[10.01.25, 18:34:57] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can't even say Dose 🤣
[10.01.25, 18:35:15] ~ Denis Mihin: There is too many dropshippers using Direct response marketing, giving big promises and under delivering. Just looking for quick cash. Everything that is going to happen this year in terms of fb and regulations in US should benefit brand owners. Less competition and healthier ecosystem.
[10.01.25, 18:35:24] ~ Landon: Do you guys use a disclaimer on listicles? I’ve only seen disclaimers on advertorials.
[10.01.25, 18:36:12] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I think the issue has been huge brands, not dropshippers. At least is what I have read from the lawsuits fb has received
[10.01.25, 18:39:08] ~ Growg: Thats correct bro, Solving any health problem takes time, lots of research & resources. You can’t build profitable business if key ingridents are not taken care but Claims were floating and people were buying stuff but my take is these people will comeup with another methodology to hook the audience.
[10.01.25, 18:40:27] ~ Growg: Huge brand issue is that they lie, claims when tested in lab is not what they claim and hence lawsuit starts
[10.01.25, 18:41:01] ~ Denis Mihin: Maybe. Im talking from my experience. Too many promises usually come from dropshippers. You can't become a big brand with a shit product usually.
[10.01.25, 18:41:32] ~ Andrea: What's your definition of big?
[10.01.25, 18:43:38] ~ Joshua: where do you guys get courses and ebooks to bundle with your products?
[10.01.25, 18:46:17] ~ Denis Mihin: In the US, something like 3M+ a year and running for atleast 1 year.

In this context, big would mean profitable over a long period of time with good reputation in the niche
[10.01.25, 18:46:57] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. What do you suggest doing when an ad account with pretty good results got restricted and a new one is performing bad? Would you keep pushing new creatives or try opening another ad account that hopefully will yield better results?
[10.01.25, 18:50:36] ~ Growg: Try Pushing new creative with different angle for few more days it will settle. 

May I know the reason for restricting and niche. ‎<This message was edited>
[10.01.25, 18:51:52] ~ Guy Edan: They didn’t give a specific reason. Only thing I can think of that may caused it is before and  after clips in the creative. Beauty niche
[10.01.25, 18:54:09] ~ Growg: Ohhhk…. Might be flagged for misleading and restricted. 

I would simply analyse which creative or sets of creative made account got restricted and use different contrasting angle and see if resulting going up or tanking. 
If not than starting fresh.
[10.01.25, 18:54:51] ~ Denis Mihin: Whats the best way to improve a existing product? My idea is:
Find alibaba supplier, chat, get sample and then go into production. 

Questions I have:
1. I currently have a private agent in China, should I ship this improved product to him and he handles the shipping and I just pay the Alibaba supplier for the inventory (no shipping).
2. What is the cost usually for custom products on Alibaba?
3. How long does it take?

If anyone has any experience, I would appreciate it.
Thanks
[10.01.25, 18:57:20] ~ Growg: Niche plz
[10.01.25, 19:14:10] ~ Denis Mihin: Electronic product
[10.01.25, 19:17:17] ~ Austin: Has anyone hired a VA with media buying experience, and trained them to do the mindless media buying / management for your store? As in testing interests and launching ads? Would love to know how that went.
[10.01.25, 19:58:54] ~ Erne: I found dozens of people hijack our listings on amazon using our name. How can we avoid that? ‎<This message was edited>
[10.01.25, 20:00:29] ~ Nal: If anyone is selling beauty/skincare products niche in US Market here, please drop me a DM. Have a couple of questions to ask.
[10.01.25, 20:00:33] ~ Guy Edan: Do you have a trademark?
[10.01.25, 20:00:44] ~ Erne: In process, not ready yet
[10.01.25, 20:01:01] ~ Erne: It takes a lot of time
[10.01.25, 20:02:09] ~ Guy Edan: If in process, you can sign up for brand registry and once you get approved, you can kick them off the listing.
Second option is assuming your products/packaging are branded, you can order a product from them and a lot of time hijackers sell not your exact product, and so if that’s the case, you report that to Amazon and they’ll kick them.

The first option is the best
[10.01.25, 20:02:24] ~ Guy Edan: Once you have brand registry people won’t be able to hijack your listings
[10.01.25, 20:03:01] ~ Erne: How i do brand registry? Directly on Amazon?
[10.01.25, 20:04:53] ~ Growg: 1. Offcourse, you can do this but Do you know that private agent personally so that things don’t get messed up. If yes than go for it. 

This way your exclusivity can be maintained but make some proper agreement or ask manufacturer if they have this exclusivity clause. 

2. Generally, I have noticed 10-20% more , for women product. Depends on supplier but should not go beyond 15% inorder to maintain your margin.

3. Again depends on manufacturer, The one I contacted delivered within 7 days but if they deal with like say Philips or some brand bigger than its tough to negotiate. 

Hope this helps
[10.01.25, 20:05:58] ~ Guy Edan: Hit the menu button on seller central —> brands —> you should see there “Brand Registry”
[10.01.25, 22:23:33] ~ LC: If anyone has a good proven prelander for the beauty/skincare niche, please drop me a DM
[11.01.25, 0:10:59] ~ Bryan T: Whats the best backup payment processor for shopify in the US?
[11.01.25, 0:24:18] ~ Matthew Martorano: There’s a bunch of them. Depends on the product’s vertical. Global Payments, Checkout.com, Worldpay, and a bunch more.
[11.01.25, 1:06:21] ~ Antonio Celani: Anyone know a good 3PL from China to ship WW?? 

Doing 500 orders daily I am looking for a better one.

Possibly located in Shenzen or Guangdong 

Ping me if you have a nice one 👌
[11.01.25, 1:09:52] ~ Aaron Ware: Ecomflow have been pretty good I’m roughly doing same volume. Beat my old 3PL by $5 and quicker shipping times.
[11.01.25, 1:10:43] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey bro PM if you like
[11.01.25, 3:07:19] ~ Mason Schulze: are many people in here using shopify payments and have most of your orders internationally, have you looked into or starting using other payement gateways to bring down the fees?
‎[11.01.25, 3:08:05] ~ Mason Schulze: ‎image omitted
[11.01.25, 3:10:19] ~ Bryan T: same boat here am going to start looking for solutions
[11.01.25, 3:10:46] ~ Mason Schulze: its heavy the fees at scale
[11.01.25, 3:10:48] ~ Tom: Shopify charges fees for letting you use different payment gateways
[11.01.25, 3:13:33] ~ Mason Schulze: trying to calculate if there much savings from upgrading to shopify plus
[11.01.25, 3:28:17] ~ Austin: Who can hook me up with a great Tic Tok agency? Already dominating on Google and Meta.
[11.01.25, 5:06:30] ~ Brian: Have you seen if changing to alternative payment providers with the additional shopify fees still allow for savings?
[11.01.25, 5:06:59] ~ Nebil: Can anyone recommend any freelancers or agencies for product images/branding? ‎<This message was edited>
[11.01.25, 6:36:20] ~ Mikael: Hey, do you guys find Shopify sensitive to ip/device login? If for example you login to the owner acc of a shopify store from several different places and devices. Are there any risk to it?
[11.01.25, 6:59:01] ~ Brian: As long as you have your 2FA should be fine
[11.01.25, 7:34:53] ~ Mikael: allright, IM just curious, (I dont have any issues yet). But I have several different stores in different Companys with different owners but I login from the same device
[11.01.25, 9:48:47] Topi: anyone running A/B tests via voluum?
[11.01.25, 12:20:55] ~ Jonny: Today has started horrendously bad
[11.01.25, 12:21:04] ~ Jonny: CVR is lowest I’ve seen
[11.01.25, 13:03:41] ~ Erne: Check dm
[11.01.25, 13:13:31] ~ Arad Khazabi: dumb question but where do you guys usually store you're received ugc content to avoid quality reducage?
[11.01.25, 13:27:34] ~ Brian: We store it in Google drive
[11.01.25, 13:27:51] ~ Arad Khazabi: So you transfer it to google drive by simply downloading it right?
[11.01.25, 13:29:01] ~ Brian: Yes exactly
[11.01.25, 13:29:16] ~ Brian: There are others that store in dropbox, or air.inc
[11.01.25, 13:29:45] ~ Brian: More importantly is how you organize your content storage so your video editors have easy access to the best content
[11.01.25, 13:39:40] ~ Num: any one had seen a drop in Bestfulfill ad accounts performance?
[11.01.25, 13:39:47] ~ Num: last 3 dasy
[11.01.25, 13:39:51] ~ Num: days
[11.01.25, 15:12:03] ~ Matthew Martorano: I hate to be the promo guy, we have solved this issue for our clients. No 3rd party fee, no currency conversion fee and you can use any processor and gateway and you can  continue to use your stripe account if you want.
[11.01.25, 15:14:11] ~ Mason Schulze: No currency conversion fee either, nice ‎<This message was edited>
[11.01.25, 15:14:30] ~ Ben Mansour: People who advertise in usa, did performance start bad today?
[11.01.25, 15:16:21] ~ Matthew Martorano: https://www.loom.com/share/dd4857264bf348b6aafe44dd65ec0e29?sid=791ed29a-90a9-4aff-a1ae-b6a1bc0252e7
[11.01.25, 15:17:59] ~ Matthew Martorano: Many of our clients will and a 2-3% on the conversion to make the appearance of free shipping. It’s buried in the product price and conversion.
[11.01.25, 15:28:59] ~ Mason Schulze: Only thing I'm worried about is the stories I hear of huge holds and money lock ups on stripe
[11.01.25, 15:29:13] ~ Mason Schulze: I've been using shopify payments for two years
[11.01.25, 15:29:38] ~ Mason Schulze: And wouldn't no how to just switch over to stripe with the volume we do each day
[11.01.25, 15:30:07] ~ Matthew Martorano: It happens maybe more than you know, without notice, and its a log hold.
[11.01.25, 15:30:45] ~ Matthew Martorano: Our data shows that to de-risk your business, you shouldn’t put more than $200-$250k on any one merchant account per month.
[11.01.25, 15:31:17] ~ Mason Schulze: So far I've never had a issue with shopify payments
[11.01.25, 15:31:20] ~ Mason Schulze: No holds
[11.01.25, 15:31:32] ~ Mason Schulze: But also chargeback rate is very low
[11.01.25, 15:31:32] ~ Matthew Martorano: That’s good.
[11.01.25, 15:31:42] ~ Mason Schulze: PayPal on the other hand fucks with me

[11.01.25, 15:33:32] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Matthew Martorano⁩ i had a onboarding call with checkoutchamp the other day and what i didn't quite understand was, if we could just use checkout champ only for the checkout page and payment processing to begin with? Is that correct
[11.01.25, 15:33:47] ~ Matthew Martorano: We hear this and see this all the time ‎<This message was edited>
[11.01.25, 15:34:15] ~ Mason Schulze: Because we have a complete store with multiple pages, blogs, home page etc etc
[11.01.25, 15:34:18] ~ Mason Schulze: On shopify
[11.01.25, 15:34:27] ~ Matthew Martorano: That is correct, and you can build all of your sales funnels and have as many stores as you want in one Checkout Champ
[11.01.25, 15:35:11] ~ Matthew Martorano: Nothing changes there except for the checkout and one-click-upsells for processing.
[11.01.25, 15:35:23] ~ Mason Schulze: Ahh
[11.01.25, 15:36:08] ~ Mason Schulze: So would basically just need to redirect all of the Checkout buttons on shopify to the new checkout page in Checkout Champ ‎<This message was edited>
[11.01.25, 15:36:39] ~ Mason Schulze: Are many using it just to do this and keeping all of the rest of the site on shopify?
[11.01.25, 15:37:06] ~ Andrea: You could do that but you'd be missing out on the best features of c.c. for a hefty price
[11.01.25, 15:37:35] ~ Andrea: Like one click upsells, directing traffic to their own custom pages..
[11.01.25, 15:37:36] ~ Mason Schulze: Yes but I would have to redeveloped my entire website onto Checkout Champ
[11.01.25, 15:38:32] ~ Matthew Martorano: No that is not correct. Your Shopify store would NOT change at all except for the checkout process.
[11.01.25, 15:39:00] ~ Matthew Martorano: And check this client out, bottom left. They have 824 sales sites running through 1 checkout champ.
‎[11.01.25, 15:39:03] ~ Matthew Martorano: ‎image omitted
[11.01.25, 15:39:29] ~ Andrea: How many campaigns is that
[11.01.25, 15:40:05] ~ Mason Schulze: Ok I'm going to get onto this tomorrow
[11.01.25, 15:40:51] ~ Matthew Martorano: 200 or so. They have a large Shopify store, and they build single product sales pages on their products which 10X’s their conversions on targeted traffic.
[11.01.25, 15:41:05] ~ Mason Schulze: Biggest problem i have is atm, huge transaction fees total on shopify payments and I can't show any post purchase upsells to customers outside of AUS my store currency
[11.01.25, 15:41:30] ~ Mason Schulze: And 85% of all our traffic is outside of AUS
[11.01.25, 15:41:48] ~ Matthew Martorano: You should just take a look at what we do, and if it solves your problem and seems to be a fit, then give it a try.
[11.01.25, 15:42:51] ~ Matthew Martorano: Our conversion rates and AOV’s across our clients are far higher. So if you’re making more and saving those fees, its a big win.
[11.01.25, 15:44:12] ~ Mason Schulze: Thanks, will get onto it
[11.01.25, 17:47:54] ~ Mithiran: @⁨~Matthew Martorano⁩ how easy is it to create a funnel on checkoutchamp? Would we need to hire a dev
[11.01.25, 18:18:01] ~ Matthew Martorano: No, we have hundreds of templates and I have a team who can help you and teach you.
[11.01.25, 18:58:54] ~ Ben Mansour: Is facebook performance good for you today?
[11.01.25, 20:45:50] ~ Kyle Twohill: How much are you comfortable processing monthly through Shopify payments, I’m super paranoid of getting a hold we have a low chargeback rate etc though
[11.01.25, 20:47:30] ~ Austin: I processed around 250K last month on shopify payments with no issues at all and about 300K by end of this month
[11.01.25, 20:51:57] ~ Parker Godfrey: If I am only spending $500 on a CBO, should I limit the amount of Adsets in my CBO? I feel like I'm not getting sufficient spend across all of them. I have winning adsets getting most spend about a 2.5 ROAS, but I have about 10+ ad sets getting $20-30 in spend bringing my overall ROAS for the campaign down to a 1.25. Am I not spending enough? Or should I cut the losing Adsets? I know a lot of people say never turn off Adsets unless you hit your campaign limit
[11.01.25, 20:57:49] ~ Austin: I use 5 ad sets per CBO and turn them off when the ad set goes negative, keeping only profitable ones to run
[11.01.25, 21:00:40] ~ Jonny: 5 of the same adsets?
[11.01.25, 21:00:56] ~ Austin: Yes
[11.01.25, 21:07:14] ~ Matt: I just turn off anything that isn’t hitting CAC targets
[11.01.25, 21:07:37] ~ Matt: If it hits CAC target then leave on but meta is telling you it’s not good enough if it’s not getting spend
[11.01.25, 21:07:44] ~ Matt: Creative isn’t good enough*
[11.01.25, 21:08:31] ~ Parker Godfrey: Okay so once I spend about 4x AOV and not at target CAC, turn it off? Is that a good spend limit?
[11.01.25, 21:09:58] ~ Matt: Depends how you want to do it, I just do it a simple way and look at last 7 days performance
[11.01.25, 21:10:07] ~ Matt: I don’t try and force spend on an asset
[11.01.25, 21:10:19] ~ Matt: Meta will know what ones to spend on
[11.01.25, 21:10:29] ~ Matt: If CAC is under target then keep on
[11.01.25, 21:10:36] ~ Matt: If over or hasn’t spent turn off and move on
[11.01.25, 21:12:38] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: If u just wanna make sure you can put little minimum spend.limit but 99% of the times meta spends on the right ones.
[11.01.25, 21:15:54] ~ Parker Godfrey: Thanks for the input! I’ll make some adjustments
[11.01.25, 21:17:39] ~ Matt: Check nick theriots videos on YouTube he goes over that structure in more detail
[11.01.25, 21:17:50] ~ Parker Godfrey: Okay I’ll take a look
[11.01.25, 21:18:25] ~ Parker Godfrey: Do you know which video you are referring to?
[11.01.25, 21:22:21] ~ Bryan T: Anyone have a chargeback prevention service they recommend?
[11.01.25, 21:22:34] ~ Bryan T: And if so what are the costs?
[11.01.25, 21:23:27] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Disputifier
[11.01.25, 21:24:00] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: They charge a % of chargebacks they win for u or the chargeback alerts.
[11.01.25, 21:25:20] ~ Matt: Just media buying ones I can’t remember exactly but won’t be hard to find
[11.01.25, 21:26:34] ~ Brian: You are mixing your winner ads with losers. Pause anything adset that isn't positive over 4-7d timeframe. You could probably be scaling the $500 CBO just that your other adsets are driving everything down.
[11.01.25, 21:27:26] ~ Brian: You want to get as much spend into your winners as possible so FB learns VS using that budget on stuff that doesn't work
[11.01.25, 21:28:35] ~ Brian: 4X AOV usually is too high. You'll burn too much on losers
[11.01.25, 21:31:07] ~ Brian: I would have pause rules based off soft metrics & ofc actual ROAS.

Eg If ad spends $10 or more with 1.5x your AVG. cpc for your format = pause

0.5 BE CPA, with no ATC/IC = pause.

Etc
[11.01.25, 21:31:36] ~ Filippo: I had this problem as well, but yes when I raised the budget performance has improved and the campaign started to spend almost all the budget on one adset. Also when I turned off the bad adsets I saw a little bit of drop in performance
[11.01.25, 21:32:23] ~ Matthew Martorano: Most of our clients use Fraud Deflect or Chargeback Wizard. ‎<This message was edited>
[12.01.25, 3:39:15] ~ Robert: I'm looking at potentially switching freight forwarders because I think I might be paying too much per kg. How much are you guys paying per kg for your freight forwarders?

I’d love to get some expert advice from you all. 😄 We run an e-commerce brand in the travel and beauty niche, and over the past year, we’ve been managing all our own content and ad creation.

My girlfriend takes care of the modeling and content creation, while I handle the scripting and editing. Now, we’re planning to launch a creative agency focused on delivering high-quality ad creatives tailored specifically for e-commerce brands.

We wanted to get your input on pricing. What do you think would be a fair rate for the full package: scripting, editing, A-roll, B-roll, and complete creative production?

We’d really appreciate your insights as we fine-tune our offerings before launching! 🙏

[13.01.25, 16:33:47] ~ Rick: Hi guys I am having problems with the advertisement platforms. (meta, google ads, pinterest).

Since Jan 6 I had a drop in perfomance never seen so high in a year and a half of life of this brand of mine.

We went from 26/27k$ day to 18k$ overnight, without any kind of change on our part, either ads or offer.
The only thing that has changed is the CPA (practically doubled), the rest remains unchanged.

The product is also seasonal and this is the best season, so the drop is not due to seasonality.

Many people have told me just to wait, keep testing creative and offer, however after a week the data is still not back like it always was.

Initially I thought it was because of the meta update since we are in the ( health and wellness niche ), I checked everything from the pixel, to the ad account to the BM, there are no restrictions or changes of any kind, they didn't remove my event purchase (as they said they would do for some shops) , so everything as usual. 

Then google also started to de-perform, moving from roas 2.3+ to roas 1.4+.

Is anyone in the same situation as me? do you know what I could do to get the results back to how they were? do you have any advice? junk traffic?

anything i'm here to listen to your advice or suggestions and try to fix this mess

thanks

[13.01.25, 16:37:51] ~ Steve: Did a new competitor enter the market with similar/better product and better ads? Have you seen anyone new coming in? Perhaps they are stealing that customer
[13.01.25, 16:38:45] ~ Rick: no we have and are checking on a daily basis, also because as soon as one comes out it has to use our contents and we take it down with DMCA
[13.01.25, 16:40:17] ~ Steve: could just be time and new creatives. From Dec 28 until Jan 8 we had a huge dip in performance overall, after a killer December
[13.01.25, 16:40:38] ~ Steve: now last 3 days we are reaching all time highs again. Didn’t change anything, just added new creatives, found a new big winner, iterating on it, scaling it
[13.01.25, 16:41:22] ~ Rick: thanks steve we are gonna test more and more ads
[13.01.25, 16:44:40] ~ Aman: Yes same happened to me exactly at the same time.
[13.01.25, 16:44:40] ~ Reus: Okay man
[13.01.25, 16:44:54] ~ Aman: If your biz does a lot in California, the fires didn't help
[13.01.25, 16:45:58] ~ Aman: Sometimes you just have to ride the wave of low buying signals, usually only lasts a week or so
[13.01.25, 16:51:06] ~ Rick: so for now the only thing to do is keep testing new creative and offer?
[13.01.25, 17:07:27] ~ Aman: We saw things pick up since Saturday with a new offer
[13.01.25, 17:08:06] ~ Aman: Creative too
[13.01.25, 17:08:28] ~ Aman: Or just check your funnel something might be off or some bad review on site is causing issues
[13.01.25, 17:08:31] ~ Aman: Speed time etc
[13.01.25, 17:09:01] ~ Rick: we have like 0.2% of disputes rate
[13.01.25, 17:09:08] ~ Rick: already optimized
[13.01.25, 17:09:28] ~ Rick: i'm preparing it
[13.01.25, 17:09:33] ~ Aman: Check pixel too
[13.01.25, 17:09:36] ~ Aman: Page score
[13.01.25, 17:09:39] ~ Aman: Pages
[13.01.25, 17:09:46] ~ Rick: page score is not available anymore
[13.01.25, 17:09:56] ~ Rick: all good no error etc
[13.01.25, 17:09:57] ~ Aman: I have a list of all of these things and I check through every Monday
[13.01.25, 17:10:05] ~ Aman: Definitely creative then
[13.01.25, 17:10:20] ~ Rick: that's my thought
[13.01.25, 17:10:21] ~ Aman: At that spend it's not product
[13.01.25, 17:10:32] ~ Aman: And likely not offer
[13.01.25, 17:10:44] ~ Aman: It's creative which is causing inefficiency
[13.01.25, 17:11:02] ~ Aman: Which leads to your dropping your spend
[13.01.25, 17:11:04] ~ Rick: yes but from overnight?
[13.01.25, 17:11:13] ~ Rick: same CPC, same CPM, same CTR
[13.01.25, 17:11:16] ~ Rick: nothing change
[13.01.25, 17:11:24] ~ Aman: Yes sometimes meta stops spending on your winners and some other shit
[13.01.25, 17:11:32] ~ Aman: Are you using CBOs?
[13.01.25, 17:11:37] ~ Rick: yes
[13.01.25, 17:11:44] ~ Aman: Check your account
[13.01.25, 17:11:49] ~ Rick: i'ts like they are send me shit traffic
[13.01.25, 17:11:54] ~ Aman: Probs spending on some trash creative
[13.01.25, 17:12:11] ~ Aman: Whereas it was spending on good creative before
[13.01.25, 17:12:17] ~ Aman: That's why I hate CBO
[13.01.25, 17:13:42] ~ Rick: only on the winners
[13.01.25, 17:16:18] ~ Aman: Then winners dead
[13.01.25, 17:29:20] ~ Jonny: We had the same thing this past weekend. ROAS and CVR dropped by 50% + . We let things run and today it seems to of picked back up again
[13.01.25, 17:30:26] ~ Rick: maaan youre giving me hope😅
[13.01.25, 17:35:44] ~ Aman: I hear a lot about meta making chnages they held back on during Q4
[13.01.25, 17:43:39] ~ Matt: I’ve had similar where CAC goes x 4 overnight for no reason but a week or so later back to normal
[13.01.25, 17:44:39] ~ Denis Mihin: Same, there are external factors we cant control
[13.01.25, 17:51:29] ~ Filippo: hey guys, can diff PayPal accounts have diff payment approval rates just like CC processors?

[13.01.25, 21:13:46] ~ Matt: Hey guys anyone in supps that can advise on the process of choosing flavours for a drinkable product and how they went about it? Can discuss over dms
[13.01.25, 21:43:37] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Naah it's just tiktok glitch try different company VCCs like visa mastercard amex or just ditch the account or try doing other stuffs but this glitch is from over a year now i remember
[13.01.25, 22:22:01] ~ Austin: The actual page won’t load, as in I can’t even input a card. I guess a new accout is needed.
[13.01.25, 22:44:59] ~ Alexander Sundström: Same thing happened to us. It just died overnight. I got on the phone with a meta rep and they told me my account got flagged because we switched payment methods frequently when we scaled on meta last month. They appealed it and now it has been picking up since it got resolved. We didn’t see any issues on the account, no restrictions at all. He told me on the phone and just like you, our ads looked fine cpm, ctr and cpc, but conversion rate tanked to numbers we have never seen before. Might be worth talking to meta
[13.01.25, 23:03:05] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. In the same topic of inconsistencies/account restrictions- I understood that if we have an ad account restricted, the other ad accounts may also be flagged and not perform optimally.

The question - if we open a new business manager account and new ad account through there, should that be ok, or should we use a whole new Facebook account? ‎<This message was edited>
[13.01.25, 23:09:06] ~ Austin: YOOOO thanks for sharing this. I had 10K of fraudulent charges in a single day last month and my bank put a temporary limit on my card causing meta to withdraw payment from multiple cards and since then CR has been down a whole 1% since...very well could be this. Thanks for sharing, meta rep actually just called me today.
[13.01.25, 23:10:56] ~ Rick: thanks man, I'll do it now and let you know, thanks again man!!!

My name is Damjan, 17, still in high school, started my ecom journey a year back with my best month being 113k (massive inconsistencies for now). Looking forward to meeting all of you. Outside of ecom I’m big into fitness - running marathons and doing CrossFit. Always down to connect so feel free to shoot me a follow or DM on IG @topalovicdamjan
 
Let’s crush it 💯🚀
[14.01.25, 2:37:27] ~ Mark: Welcome my man @⁨~Damjan Topalovic⁩
[14.01.25, 2:42:06] ~ Aaron Ware: Well done brother! Huge achievement for 17 years old 🚀
[14.01.25, 3:56:06] ~ Kyle Twohill: I have a store where we could not get a good enough amount of inventory for the coming Chinese new years, the factory is shutting down sooner than expected. If I shut off my ads for 15-20 days is it likely they don't perform again if I turn them off and back on after. Or, should I scale down to a super low adspend compared to what its at now to keep data flowing. So basically I have 2 options, blow through my inventory in a few days and shut off, or scale down super hard and make it last the 20 days just to keep data flowing.
[14.01.25, 4:00:47] ~ Mithiran: When this happened last year to us, we added a disclaimer on our website below the add to cart that we're out of stock and when we will be back in stock. And kept them updated via email.
[14.01.25, 4:02:50] ~ Kyle Twohill: Oh wow nice. How were refunds etc and chargebacks, was it a cs nightmare?
[14.01.25, 4:08:41] ~ Mithiran: I think we had a 3-4% rate for the refunds from just the delay in stock. Yes CS was a bit of a nightmare, a lot more tickets. But what we did was add in some free items like ebooks and stuff for waiting
[14.01.25, 4:10:21] ~ Kyle Twohill: That’s awesome wow not bad at all
[14.01.25, 4:10:34] ~ Kyle Twohill: How long did you run it like that would you estimate
[14.01.25, 4:10:42] ~ Kyle Twohill: Thanks for the advice
[14.01.25, 4:16:05] ~ Mithiran: No worries man, around 20 days usually. I don't really like doing it for too long, but I also don't want to just turn off the ads.
[14.01.25, 4:16:44] ~ Kyle Twohill: Agreed, getting the best performance I’ve ever had so I’d hate to lol
[14.01.25, 4:23:32] ~ Caesar: yeah, this year i feel like things shut down way quicker then last year, i remember last year i was ordering stock even late january, but now as soon as it hit 3rd/4th January our supplier just despawned
[14.01.25, 4:24:49] ~ Kyle Twohill: Wow yeah our literally dropped a bomb on us said we had plenty of time to order them messaged us saying yesterday was the deadline lol
[14.01.25, 4:26:36] ~ Caesar: there has to be other suppliers that have your product, check with more agents
[14.01.25, 4:26:51] ~ Caesar: turning off ads is like last resort for me personally, 0 cash flow is just a nightmare
[14.01.25, 4:45:03] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys, launched a new listicle advertorial last month (swipe from javvy) and the performance hasnt been great compared to my regular product page. How should I improve it? 

Should I keep on testing headlines or should I just try a different type of advertorial?
[14.01.25, 4:50:09] ~ Kyle Twohill: Talking with a few other options now I should be good. Price just may be sa bit more we’ll see though
[14.01.25, 7:16:01] ~ Kim Romanov: Did you resent AT30165 to initial address or to Melinda Gladys Otero Caban 228 6th Ave Roebling, NJ 08554?

[14.01.25, 8:26:45] ~ Zsombor: Anyone here experienced really bad fb ads performance the last 2 days?
[14.01.25, 8:27:43] ~ Mason Schulze: we noticed the accounts stopped spending as aggressively as they were
[14.01.25, 8:27:51] ~ Mason Schulze: but ROAS really good
[14.01.25, 9:09:55] ~ Ry: Past 7 days for me.
[14.01.25, 9:19:35] ~ Nicolò: Me too
[14.01.25, 9:36:18] ~ Caesar: yeah, been 2 strange days brev
[14.01.25, 9:47:19] ~ Zsombor: same, haven't had this in months
[14.01.25, 9:48:06] ~ Musawer: Yeah same to me, after new year CPMs dropped and sales were good but for a few days CPM suddenly went back up
[14.01.25, 9:49:22] ~ Mithiran: Just yesterday was horrible, today is a lot better
[14.01.25, 9:55:31] ~ Zsombor: yeah yesterday horrible, maybe a lil better today for us too
[14.01.25, 10:11:09] ~ Matt: What’s this?
[14.01.25, 10:55:36] Bob: Yesterday our entire ad account overspend by at least 25% each. 

We run a lot of ABO’s and CBO’s, and it’s the same on all. 

1 of the ad accounts was stable, one tanked in performance.

Just wanna see if anyone else saw the overspending?
[14.01.25, 11:20:50] ~ M A N U E L: same
[14.01.25, 15:37:49] ~ Nal: We have USA LLC and tried to set up shopify payments for USA as a non US resident on a newer store. 

They either ask for SSN or proof that you have physical business presence within the US. We ship from china currently and they didn’t accept USA Warehouse from our supplier as good enough. 

Anybody have any recommendations for alternative payment processors to use or ways to get around this? ‎<This message was edited>
[14.01.25, 15:38:42] ~ Bazeed: I used the llc  ein inplace of the ssn it worked, no issues so far

[14.01.25, 16:08:02] ~ Andrea: If your intention is a long term brand an evergreen sector isn't a bad idea. Like supplements skincare health etc
[14.01.25, 16:08:25] ~ Wouter: Yes we only do long term
[14.01.25, 16:08:53] ~ Wouter: I already run a skincare and supplement brand but we want to expand our range.
[14.01.25, 16:09:06] ~ Wouter: With a new brand
[14.01.25, 16:09:29] ~ Rick: how is your annual revenue?

[14.01.25, 21:23:53] ~ Alexander Sundström: Are you selling in the EU?
[14.01.25, 21:24:58] ~ Parker Godfrey: No USA
[14.01.25, 21:26:02] ~ Aman: Mostly spending on Meta?
[14.01.25, 21:26:12] ~ Alexander Sundström: okay, i am concerned about not having the cookie banner turned on in the eu, would that have a negative impact on the sales channels that are connected on shopify?
[14.01.25, 21:26:13] ~ Aman: I think everyone spending big is seeing the same
[14.01.25, 21:28:45] ~ Parker Godfrey: Yeah mainly meta
[14.01.25, 21:29:30] ~ Aman: My guess is they’re making changes with this AI stuff
[14.01.25, 21:30:41] ~ Parker Godfrey: Gotcha. Looks like others are seeing the same.... Hope it bounces back quick!
[14.01.25, 21:31:38] ~ Nicolò: even for me since Monday 06 the roas went from 2/2.2 to 1.5
luckily we haven't suffered any negative days, now we are lowering the campaigns that weren't performing and testing creative new ones.

[15.01.25, 11:24:01] ~ Rustam: Any solution to this?
[15.01.25, 11:24:12] ~ Rick: where you see this?
[15.01.25, 11:25:05] ~ Rustam: On fb ads manager
[15.01.25, 11:25:22] ~ Rustam: Went from $10k days to $7k, then we see this😅
[15.01.25, 11:25:39] ~ Rick: yes but where
[15.01.25, 11:25:45] ~ Rick: homepage?
[15.01.25, 11:26:07] ~ Rustam: At the pixel settings
[15.01.25, 11:26:49] ~ Rick: let me see
[15.01.25, 11:27:32] ~ Rick: you sell supplement?
[15.01.25, 11:31:10] ~ Rustam: Nope, we actually sell clothing that we don’t even positition as a health product
[15.01.25, 11:31:47] ~ Rick: wtf ahahah
[15.01.25, 11:32:17] ~ Rustam: It has the benefits for health, but the main angle is different
[15.01.25, 11:32:45] ~ Rustam: We requested review, but I think we are cooked, all bottom of funnel events blocked for optimization
[15.01.25, 11:32:59] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Lovro Knavs⁩
[15.01.25, 11:36:19] ~ Rustam: Would appreciate any input, thanks beforehand
[15.01.25, 11:38:47] ~ Filippo: Where can I see if I have this too?
[15.01.25, 11:39:43] ~ Rustam: pixel settings bro, it’ll show up as an error
[15.01.25, 13:01:35] ~ Caesar: @⁨~Rustam⁩ dataset settings?
[15.01.25, 13:11:29] ~ Rustam: Yes
[15.01.25, 13:12:16] ~ Caesar: Scary stuff
[15.01.25, 13:12:21] ~ Caesar: Im in health too
[15.01.25, 13:28:44] ~ Filippo: @⁨~Rustam⁩ did u see a clear performance drop?
[15.01.25, 13:28:56] ~ Filippo: Or just scared of potential outcomes ?
[15.01.25, 13:41:31] ~ Rustam: Sharp drop, 30% revenue down, with the same adspend. 

I dug deeper, turns out all EU countries are affected and others are not. Removed them from my campaigns. 

No tracking available for them even for past dates. Everything viped out. Top 5 still normal. 

Prepare for this guys, it’s coming if you’re even remotely touching a health niche
[15.01.25, 13:56:28] ~ Steve: its why you need better branded content/ads imo
[15.01.25, 13:57:02] ~ Steve: if you’re gonna be a hardcore dropshipper in health with no care for compliance making just retarded health claims combined with non stop pumping AI ads…..NGMI
[15.01.25, 13:57:15] ~ Steve: gonna be uphill battle for you, especially if you are new/not established
[15.01.25, 13:59:52] ~ Mithiran: Shit, what are you planning on doing? YouTube ads?
[15.01.25, 14:00:17] ~ Mason Schulze: I'm not sure if it matters how good of a brand you have or your ads are if they flag your domain
[15.01.25, 14:00:45] ~ Mason Schulze: It's just health related in general I'm hearing
[15.01.25, 14:00:49] ~ Steve: it definetly matters if you’re a good brand
[15.01.25, 14:01:05] ~ Rick: Yes same for me
[15.01.25, 14:01:10] ~ Steve: because if you’re a good brand and yo’re running social, content, plus direct response ads then you have a varied ad library, and your brand awareness grows
[15.01.25, 14:01:35] ~ Rick: Plus have multichannel adv
[15.01.25, 14:01:42] ~ Steve: as your brand awareness grows, you don’t need to live and die on “Heal your incurable health problems with my product in 2 fucking weeks take 75% off now” copy
[15.01.25, 14:02:16] ~ Steve: you can focus on why your product is better, use customer reviews, creator content etc - it’s the harder path but its honestly more rewarding building actually useful shit for people
[15.01.25, 14:02:48] ~ Mason Schulze: Not sure how meta is going to make the judgement who gets flagged or not
[15.01.25, 14:05:32] ~ Wouter: we run a health business not flagged at all
[15.01.25, 14:05:46] ~ Wouter: We use our own customers in content, found videos and real reviews
[15.01.25, 14:06:02] ~ Wouter: Our products have over 7000 5star reviews and we develop our own products
[15.01.25, 14:06:40] ~ Rick: Patented?
[15.01.25, 14:07:23] ~ Mason Schulze: Yes I'm in the same boat, real brand health and wellness product 1000s of real reviews 2.5 years running
[15.01.25, 14:07:24] ~ Steve: authenticity matters so much, even more now. Brands gonna be rewarded for that
[15.01.25, 14:07:31] ~ Mason Schulze: Still panicking haha
[15.01.25, 14:07:56] ~ Steve: the algo is gonna get tons of shit wrong, it will adjust, always does

[15.01.25, 14:45:45] ~ Wouter: Products are patented
[15.01.25, 14:45:49] ~ Rick: Yes
[15.01.25, 14:45:58] ~ Omar Tayara: what do you sell?
[15.01.25, 14:46:08] ~ Andrea: Yeah the product patent part is hard(er)
[15.01.25, 14:46:10] ~ Rick: Yes but you can do it:
Patented design 
Patented invention
[15.01.25, 14:46:20] ~ Rick: And are 2 different things as well
[15.01.25, 14:47:38] ~ Rick: Patented invention is like every product of Dyson

[15.01.25, 19:06:31] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone using elevar here?
[15.01.25, 19:09:27] ~ Charles: Anyone heard about this: https://www.alialearn.com/
I’ve been strongly recommended
[15.01.25, 20:17:52] ~ Kyle Twohill: what % traffic do you guys use for split tests at scale im going to run a few like changing the header etc on a shopify PDP using a tool like a/b convert
[15.01.25, 20:18:53] ~ Filippo: Is Shopify payments with LLC as nonUS resident easy to get ?
[15.01.25, 20:20:38] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yes. Just get a EIN and EIN at the place of SSN and the accept it, I have a LLC on Indian passport and works fine for me.
[15.01.25, 20:20:55] ~ Filippo: Thanks.
[15.01.25, 20:20:55] ~ Andrea: 50 or 20 if you're scared of losing money
[15.01.25, 20:30:24] ~ Gustavo Drumm: How did your guys set up your LLC? could you share a bit about the taxes %? 

i’m also a nonUS resident
[15.01.25, 20:30:57] ~ Ben Mansour: https://wyomingllcattorney.com/Form-a-Wyoming-LLC?utm_adgroup=129508862626&utm_term=kwd-897782053374&utm_campaign=15308654847&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=129508862626&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA7Y28BhAnEiwAAdOJUHY1YmMze929LRpjGsbg2Uieue_1r2LQWef-HwFfEx3QLy-0CRj32xoCD3sQAvD_BwE
[15.01.25, 20:30:57] ~ Ben Mansour: 0 taxes
[15.01.25, 20:46:27] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I would suggest if u have some income then just get a HK LLC, 0 taxes, costs slightly higher to setup like 800£ but it's good and better
[15.01.25, 20:47:30] ~ Gustavo Drumm: thanks for the link. will check it out
[15.01.25, 20:48:38] ~ Gustavo Drumm: how’s that different from the USA? ‎<This message was edited>
[15.01.25, 20:52:02] ~ A: Would Shopify payments still work with hk LLC, I thought need USA or canada LLC
[15.01.25, 20:53:43] ~ Bazeed: It does but only diff is HK i believe is 0% corporate tax on offshore companies
[15.01.25, 20:53:55] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yes SP is available in hk bro
[15.01.25, 20:55:39] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I'm not sure bro but I have a LLC in new mexico too and these two usa states have 0% taxes till a cap, after that they do have taxes, hk is like dubai and even all chinese suppliers have one company in HK and they pay no taxes too. I can be wrong but that's what I know.
[15.01.25, 21:01:17] ~ Gustavo Drumm: thanks for the info. I will look into it
[15.01.25, 21:01:25] ~ Gustavo Drumm: how did you setup the HK one?
[15.01.25, 21:01:26] ~ Rustam: We have fully custom product, no health claims and fully ugc based ads. So it’s a weird thing. No fat burning, nothing😅
[15.01.25, 21:02:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Just get any agency from Google doing it for you.
[15.01.25, 21:07:23] ~ Lucas Alves: how can i get a HK LLC? do you have any info about it?
[15.01.25, 21:08:16] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I don't remember the agency I used but it was just a normal company my partner googled and got done.
[15.01.25, 21:08:28] ~ Omar: getstarted hk
[15.01.25, 21:08:50] ~ Lucas Alves: thankss!!
[15.01.25, 21:58:50] ~ Denis Mihin: Big misconception is that you have 0% tax but thats not true most of the time.

If you are not a resident in countries like Dubai, Cayman Islands, Monaco. You pay tax in your local country!

You are subject to worldwide income. Almost all europe countries tax you on your global income.

So if you have a US LLC you only have 0% tax in US, but you pay tax in your country of residence.
[15.01.25, 21:59:47] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: True.
[15.01.25, 22:00:42] ~ Denis Mihin: I see lot of people confused about this, Just go ask your local tax authority about your 0% tax income and see what they tell you🤣
[15.01.25, 22:04:23] ~ Omar: Yh the director and shareholder of your 0% company is they resident in EU 

Ur going prison
[15.01.25, 22:04:35] ~ Omar: They will share info with ur local tax authority
[15.01.25, 22:05:49] ~ Denis Mihin: Idk about prison
[15.01.25, 22:06:48] ~ Omar: If u own assets too they can fine you and take ur assets if u can’t afford fine
[15.01.25, 22:07:29] ~ Denis Mihin: Yes, so the best thing to do is consult with your local cpa
[15.01.25, 22:07:35] ~ Denis Mihin: Or ask directly
[16.01.25, 0:57:09] ~ Nal: Anyone here can comment on using “learn more” vs “shop now” CTA on meta please? This is to send customers to a prelander.

Our main competitor uses learn more so wanted to see how much of a difference it’s made to some of you.
[16.01.25, 0:57:43] ~ Ben Mansour: Learn more worked best do far for us
[16.01.25, 0:57:49] ~ Ben Mansour: Even to send to product page
[16.01.25, 0:57:56] ~ Nal: Interesting
[16.01.25, 0:57:57] ~ Nal: Thanks
[16.01.25, 1:30:02] ~ Kyle Twohill: Are you guys able to get decent revenue from Pinterest ads? What % of overall
[16.01.25, 1:42:38] ~ Ben Mansour: Is anyone using elevar?
[16.01.25, 2:00:02] ~ Aman: rubbish wetracked better
[16.01.25, 4:24:59] ~ Caesar: But Dubai is not a country brother:)
[16.01.25, 4:25:46] ~ Denis Mihin: When i talk about UAE, I just say Dubai. My bad🤣
[16.01.25, 4:27:44] ~ Caesar: Yeah, I don’t get why most ppl try to tax evade without moving residence, because it’s just so much hassle, loopholes, etc, and most times its not even 100% legal, better to just move and easy peasy, I personally reside in the UAE and living here is 30x better then my rundown Western country 🚀❤️ ‎<This message was edited>
[16.01.25, 4:32:45] ~ Ry: I using a service to setup hk company, 0 tax and they set up bank accounts, paypal for u.
[16.01.25, 5:18:02] ~ Mason Schulze: Zero tax only if you leave the money abroad right?
[16.01.25, 5:24:12] ~ Ry: There’s a way to transfer out 🥳 the accountant has more info
[16.01.25, 5:35:15] ~ A: Who is the service from
[16.01.25, 5:52:58] ~ Mikael: About Airwallex. Anyone here running airwallex and the total money on the acc doesnt match the profitcalc  in the store? Its like 20% less profit in our airwallex acc than whats shown in the actual profit calc..
[16.01.25, 6:13:14] ~ Phil: Must be some hidden fees there
[16.01.25, 6:16:23] ~ Kyle Twohill: Wetracked is by far the best and cheapest I have used
[16.01.25, 6:35:00] ~ Mithiran: Has anyone else saw a 30% increase in CPMs in the last 7 days - compared to previous period?
[16.01.25, 6:35:32] ~ Carlos: People have to understand that Wyoming/Delaware/Hong Kong LLCs are a great tool to have in this space but they are not a get out of jail free card.

By all means use them, but everyone has to be aware that without moving residency, those LLCs aren't a magical cloak of protection from your local tax authority.

Any european country will simply say that there's no substance in that company and that as a resident you have to claim the entirety of the income of that LLC as your personal income in your taxes. From a legal standpoint, most tax codes consider that those companies don't exist if you have nothing that shows that they serve any purpose other than tax evasion.

So yeah go ahead and use them but be aware of the risk. You're still operating in grey areas and hoping to not get caught.

Once you hit it big what makes sense is to either accept the real tax bill in your country or move residency to a 0% or low income tax country (UAE, Cyprus, Andorra). ‎<This message was edited>
[16.01.25, 6:38:19] ~ Wouter: 100%
[16.01.25, 6:38:38] ~ Wouter: And if you’re going to sell your business they actually want to see that you have paid your taxes.
[16.01.25, 6:38:51] ~ Wouter: Could be good money now but maybe not in the longterm.
[16.01.25, 6:44:02] ~ Mason Schulze: for the guys selling worldwide, are you also paying taxes to all the other countries outside of your home country.
[16.01.25, 6:45:41] ~ Caesar: So well said man 💯👏
[16.01.25, 6:48:53] ~ Mikael: 20% sounds alot and yes. There is something I can not see I guess..
[16.01.25, 6:50:52] ~ Carlos: Unfortunately I've been through this issue a lot 😅 the vision that they sell us online _just get a LLC bro_ never holds when you talk to actual experts in real life
[16.01.25, 6:51:16] ~ Caesar: Yes 100%
[16.01.25, 6:51:33] ~ Caesar: And then you ACTUALLY confirm whats legal and not, and you find out its usually just tax evasion…
[16.01.25, 6:52:00] ~ Caesar: Better to move and be done with it, its the least of «sacrifices» to make anyway in this entire journey 🙏🚀
[16.01.25, 6:52:27] ~ Phil: You can use the HK structures just pay your tax when you pay yourself
[16.01.25, 6:52:43] ~ Phil: It’s more for processing really
[16.01.25, 6:53:02] ~ Mikael: Also about all the tax talk. Im no tax advisor. But what I see is that people need to split and see that Company tax and your personal tax is 2 totally different things. 

Company profit is taxed in the country you have your company in.

While your personal income is taxed in your residential country.
[16.01.25, 6:53:21] ~ Phil: Exactly^^
[16.01.25, 6:57:44] ~ Aaron Ware: Such a good topic would love to know more about this ⬆️
[16.01.25, 7:23:18] ~ Aaron Ware: What do you do with the money stuck in the business account? How do you ever get to use it if it’s locked up overseas ?
[16.01.25, 7:25:19] ~ Phil: It’s not. You transfer over what you need to use as your own “profits” then you get taxed in the tax bracket your on in your home country
[16.01.25, 7:25:29] ~ Phil: The rest stays in the business account as expenses
[16.01.25, 7:27:22] ~ Phil: Then again just say HK structure with airwallex. You can get cards connected to the account obviously but I’m curious if you can just use that card to spend in your home country
[16.01.25, 7:27:47] ~ Phil: Then idk if you would have to pay tax or not since your not transferring it to a bank your just paying through the card
[16.01.25, 9:27:04] ~ Reus: How and where do you source supplementary products?
[16.01.25, 9:36:15] ~ Maxi: Basically you should have a personal bank account in whatever country you are resident in.

You send let’s say $2000 of personal income from HK or US LLC there and you pay the normal income tax bracket in your country on those $2000 which is your salary obviously
[16.01.25, 9:37:30] ~ Filippo: Anybody using Airwallex for processing ?
[16.01.25, 9:38:34] ~ Mert M: Dont use it
[16.01.25, 9:38:46] ~ Filippo: Why
[16.01.25, 9:39:02] ~ Mert M: They are demons
[16.01.25, 9:39:38] ~ Mert M: Will block you if you use for process. You better can do only for banking and process via sp with hk
[16.01.25, 9:52:01] ~ Filippo: Thank u for warning me
[16.01.25, 9:52:15] ~ Filippo: Anybody using Hong Kong PayPal?
[16.01.25, 9:53:18] ~ Robin: Really? We processed over $500k on a relative new airwallex account. No issues so far
[16.01.25, 9:54:04] ~ Robin: How much did you process before the blocked you? Or they blocked you straight away?
[16.01.25, 9:54:40] ~ Ry: I dont have any issues with airwallex. Great support. Horrible experience with shopify payment.
[16.01.25, 9:55:20] ~ Caesar: hahahah is that a thing? did u find it?
[16.01.25, 9:56:06] ~ Mert M: Yeah they blocked 2 of my accs. And everyone i know that used it for process had problems
[16.01.25, 9:59:24] ~ Caesar: Guys using funnelish, have you added that new express checkout feature they got now? It has G pay, Apple Pay, and I think paypal express checkout as well.
[16.01.25, 10:03:12] ~ Matt: Can you send link please to apply?
[16.01.25, 11:06:56] ~ Jonny: Hi guys, anyone got any good suppliers they can recommend? Currently doing around 200 orders/day.

[16.01.25, 11:08:28] ~ Jonny: Thanks boss
[16.01.25, 11:09:16] ~ Jonny: Anyone else find best fulfills prices always higher than alternatives?
[16.01.25, 11:15:36] ~ Filippo: The most professional tho
[16.01.25, 11:15:48] ~ Filippo: How long does shipping take for you with bestfulfill?
[16.01.25, 11:16:26] ~ Jonny: They are really good. But all there quotes seem pricey compared with others
[16.01.25, 11:16:47] ~ Filippo: My last product had higher price with them
[16.01.25, 11:19:27] ~ Dr Zied: Hey guys

[16.01.25, 11:27:46] ~ Ben Mansour: Btw
[16.01.25, 11:28:04] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone knows agency ad accounts that you can use card with?

[16.01.25, 11:29:42] ~ Jonny: Orange trail charge 3.5% or around that
[16.01.25, 11:30:03] ~ Ben Mansour: What are the fees?
[16.01.25, 11:30:15] ~ Ben Mansour: I know them, trying to find something with lower fees
[16.01.25, 11:31:35] ~ Jonny: 2.5% on over 200k/month spend
[16.01.25, 11:32:58] ~ Ben Mansour: Are their accounts strong?
[16.01.25, 11:33:26] ~ Jonny: I haven't used there meta ones yet
[16.01.25, 11:33:28] ~ Jonny: using tik tok
[16.01.25, 11:35:01] ~ ...: Hey guys.
What US bank you would recommend for those who is not US citizen but have the LLC in the  US. I already have Mercury. 
I want to know what other alternatives there are to open and operate without as issue
[16.01.25, 11:35:35] ~ Aaron Ware: Message meta
[16.01.25, 11:37:29] ~ ...: Also I recently I have received an email from Mercury for the routine check and they have picked 3 random transactions from a few months back made to my supplier and they are asking for the invoices, contract and their address documents which I provided all. 

Is this something that happened to you and how serious is it?
[16.01.25, 11:44:06] ~ Dr Zied: 5% less than 100k, you can insert your card. No monthly fees. Their accounts are not http pool, direct support from meta. Not like some other agencies ‎<This message was edited>
[16.01.25, 12:21:02] ~ Malik: Hey guys, I am having good results on average but some days are bad - which is normal - but when you feel like 2-3 days are bad do you keep testing everyday even with bad days ? I test 6 assets everyday, I wonder if I should test every 2 days just to make sure I don't test on bad days
[16.01.25, 12:24:35] ~ Malik: For example now in mid-january I can feel that it is not going to be the best days ever because people didn't get their first salary of the year yet (especially after all the christmas and eoy, holidays expanses)
[16.01.25, 12:24:44] ~ Malik: What is your testing rythm guys ?
[16.01.25, 12:25:04] ~ Rick: news?
[16.01.25, 12:25:15] ~ Rick: i've done it

[16.01.25, 13:15:14] ~ Malik: 5k
[16.01.25, 13:19:05] ~ Filippo: And you’re testing 6 adsets per day? In my opinion you’re over testing

[16.01.25, 13:25:12] ~ RakanGammoh: Will do 🤝
[16.01.25, 13:25:43] ~ Lovro Knavs: What we do is test new batches only on the days we know performance should be good (depends from client to client)
[16.01.25, 13:26:45] ~ Lovro Knavs: And about volume - i would adjust that based on your spend , just to make sure you re not testing too little/much
[16.01.25, 13:50:10] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Hey guys really stressed at the moment have 250 k hold on my store, they said it’s a ‘review of my store’ asked for inventory documents and everything which is no worries bcz I have all US manufacturing and etc. 

The problem is I need this released asap due to cashflow issues, any one dealt with this? - know how to make this process faster?
[16.01.25, 13:51:43] ~ Ry: Dont worry mine’s always release 2-3 days max after sending necessary documents
[16.01.25, 13:52:36] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Okay cool cool inshallah releases soon
[16.01.25, 15:18:22] ~ Matthew Martorano: Yes, our large brands/clients refuse to use Stripe. They de-risk by using other processors. That happens frequently, and is a common horror story.
[16.01.25, 15:21:16] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Damn
[16.01.25, 15:21:25] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Thanks for insight
[16.01.25, 15:22:22] ~ Matthew Martorano: And another fact, they will never give you your cardholder data, and technically you don’t even own the data.
[16.01.25, 15:23:57] ~ Mithiran: What other payment processors do you normally recommend?
[16.01.25, 15:24:55] ~ Andrea: I think ideally you don't rely on just 1 but have multiple
[16.01.25, 16:05:19] ~ Matthew Martorano: Depends on what geos you are selling into, product type, volume, etc…
[16.01.25, 16:06:28] ~ Matthew Martorano: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ maybe we should do a live stream for the group to discuss all things processing. People seem to think that Stripe/Shopify Payments is the answer when there’s far too much risk around it.

[16.01.25, 17:54:27] ~ Jonny: For those scaling well with CBOs, how many adsets do you put in each?

[16.01.25, 18:31:09] ~ Omar Tayara: Hey guys what kind of performance based packages are you giving editors
[16.01.25, 18:50:38] ~ Charles: I think you should give performance based to your strategist. Editor based salary
[16.01.25, 20:24:03] ~ Kyle Twohill: For anyone doing the one cbo method do you like assigning a minimum spend to creative tests or just see if it gets spend from fb kill if not after a while
[16.01.25, 20:27:05] ~ Mithiran: We use the main CBO method and i dont really touch minimum spend. Whenever a creative doesn't spend, I'll just put it in a new campaign and set a low spend to it (but we make sure that the creative in the new campaign is very different to the original campaign creatives to limit overlap)

It's worked heaps of times btw, but those ads don't really scale that much as the ads that take up spend in main CBO. But have higher ROAS at lower spends.
[16.01.25, 20:28:06] ~ Kyle Twohill: Got it thanks man
[16.01.25, 20:32:12] ~ Nicolò: For each adset that does not spend in the main, do you go for a separate campaign with only 1 adset? Or 1 campaign with all the ad-sets not spending? Low budget you mean 10% of total spending more or less?
[16.01.25, 20:57:17] ~ Mithiran: Yes for each ad set.

Regarding seperate campaign, it depends on the spend of the campaign, if its really low spend then ill add like around 2 ad sets.

Around 5-10% of total spend.
[16.01.25, 21:20:36] ~ Filippo: How is working this for you? How are the results of those ads that didn’t spend before on the main cbo?
[16.01.25, 22:18:29] ~ Kyle Twohill: what are the cheapest payment processing rates I should expect to get with a third party? using shopify payments right now it seems a bit high
[16.01.25, 22:31:12] ~ Matthew Martorano: What countries are you selling into?
[16.01.25, 22:34:04] ~ Kyle Twohill: Mostly USA then like 20% of transactions go to various eu countries Canada and uk
[16.01.25, 23:03:32] ~ Matthew Martorano: I would check withreach.com, Ariwallex.com, and Checkout.com

[17.01.25, 0:03:45] ~ Christopher Murphy: Anyone doing bid caps on Facebook ads?
[17.01.25, 0:32:17] ~ Zvi: Hi guys im getting very shotty results on my ads even though improving the quality day by day i had better results in the past with ads of lower quality had a competitor threaten us that if we dont stop advertising he will mess with our ads and since then it hasn’t been the same looking for a way or a contact at fb that can check if something is wrong with my accounts its on all my business managers and all ad accounts and it wont even let me contact support anymore
[17.01.25, 0:47:52] ~ Austin: Does anyone have suggestion for TicTok agency?
[17.01.25, 7:26:47] ~ Landon: Have you guys had any issues with adding new ads to ASC recently? When I go to add one now none show up to import.
[17.01.25, 9:00:17] ~ ...: You can copy the ad and import it to existing campaign instead of importing it inside the ASC
[17.01.25, 10:06:38] ~ Mikael: Anyone in Miami during Feb and wana network?
[17.01.25, 12:30:14] ~ Num: Anyone have seen a drop on last 8 9 days on BESFULLFILL AD ACCOUNTS?
[17.01.25, 13:28:49] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys,

When someone clicks on add to cart, do you take them straight to checkout or show a slide cart or cart page?
[17.01.25, 13:37:10] ~ Samy: I have split tested both and for me slide cart performs a little better, specially on products with a lot of different variants. Think people prefer to check what they have put in the cart before they pay. ‎<This message was edited>
[17.01.25, 13:51:04] ~ Mithiran: Thanks man, Do you know what % better? ‎<This message was edited>
[17.01.25, 15:12:39] ~ Samy: To be honest I dont remember bro since it was more than a year ago. But the difference wasnt that big, very small %.

[17.01.25, 21:27:22] ~ Guy Edan: Thanks. Do you remember how? Can’t find it
[17.01.25, 21:28:45] ~ LC: datasources - select pixel - add new business assets, copy paste id

[19.01.25, 0:15:21] ~ Carlos Ribeiro: Hi guys, I was victim of a ad account scam, I have the message as two authenticator factor, which means that if anyone tries to change my fb password i get a message. Happens that I didn't get any message and someone entered my fb and changed the password and entered my ads manager. They removed everyone from the business manager and managed to publish an ad with 1500€ budget which was already billed. I'm now canceling and the cards and completly lost my business manager. This makes me believe this is job from insiders. They entered changed password and put a two authenticator factor with google authenticator

I need to solve this situation, has anyone ever faced any issue like this?

[19.01.25, 0:25:06] ~ Vish: And the email you received

[19.01.25, 6:45:09] ~ Gord JB: We implemented the app reBuy which has a great slider cart. You can upsell, cross sell & bundle.

10% increase in AOV & increased conv rate.
If you need a contact there, lmk
[19.01.25, 7:12:48] ~ Mithiran: Interesting, thanks. We're not building on shopify but when we are in the future ill definitely hit you up.

Did you do a split test with and without to see the difference in conv. rate?

I've been checking my stripe to see if it's an issue from my payment processor, enabled test mode and it worked, I also just bought from my own card and it also worked - But have people trying to purchase and they're getting 'do not honour' code as reason of payment failed. Any idea what this could be?

[20.01.25, 17:13:32] ~ Charles: I dont think so I dont know much about wetracked
[20.01.25, 17:15:26] ~ Charles: Mmmmm true. We’ve tried a countless times with the support and they had no idea what they were saying so we just gave up. Did you had the same problem?

[20.01.25, 22:45:50] ~ Guy Edan: What’s the consensus on launching new ads mid day? I know it’s better to just do it by scheduling to start at 5-6 am next day, but did someone test if its really that detrimental to launch it at 1-2pm? ‎<This message was edited>

[21.01.25, 6:01:30] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Hey all, looking for input on the best adspying app and WHY. Currently looking at Minea, Adspy, Dropispy. Input on those? Others that are better? Reasons behind comments is appreciated. Thanks fam!
[21.01.25, 6:09:02] ~ Mithiran: For those who run post purchase upsell vsls. 

Do you unhide the price and offer on the landing page when you introduce the product in the vsl or when you tell them the price in the VSL?
[21.01.25, 9:07:03] ~ Growg: Generally its better to disclose pricing in VSL but again it depends on niche and how your target audience reacts. So have a close watch on metrics and see whats working.
[21.01.25, 10:00:30] ~ Mithiran: Yeah I disclose price on vsl. I'm wondering when you allow them to actually buy - is it once you disclose the price or when u introduce the product?
[21.01.25, 10:15:03] ~ Growg: After introducing product but not immediately, let them wait for few more minutes. Str VSL in such a way that they are hooked and pricing doesnot let them make decision,so basically try few minute after introducing or if not put Subtext bold at last.
[21.01.25, 10:23:02] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: hey everyone any insider connect to airwallex they logged me out of my account overnight and locked my account as well. It had 40k£ in it and myself I haven't had good experience with airwallex im scared rn.

[21.01.25, 15:30:29] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Dmed you boss
[21.01.25, 15:31:31] ~ Zsombor: Yeah don't use them for payment processing in the future if you also use them for banking.

[21.01.25, 16:21:02] ~ Alexander Sundström: A developer question, if I copy a theme that includes tags and publish it on a different store but have it password protected. Could that affect the performance of the current store? 

Google TikTok and meta just tanked today right after publishing it. 

If that is the reason, what action should I take? ‎<This message was edited>

[22.01.25, 0:25:04] ~ Kyle Twohill: Does anyone in here have a contact for a creative strategist who is actually good they have worked with?
[22.01.25, 12:56:44] ~ Ben Mansour: Post on linkedin and upwork, you can find good ones
[22.01.25, 12:57:35] ~ Ben Mansour: Guys if anyone using shopify payments with non-resident llc
[22.01.25, 12:58:08] ~ Ben Mansour: We have been using it fine for almost 5 months (i put ein instead of ssn when i set it up)
[22.01.25, 12:58:47] ~ Ben Mansour: But yesterday shopify sent a notification that we have to update ssn because it doesn‘t match irs records
[22.01.25, 12:59:05] ~ Ben Mansour: I put ein again, but it‘s rejected
[22.01.25, 12:59:08] ~ Ben Mansour: What should i do
[22.01.25, 12:59:45] ~ Bazeed: get an ITIN and use that instead of ssn, it takes long to get tho.
[22.01.25, 13:04:54] ~ Ben Mansour: Shit
[22.01.25, 13:05:03] ~ Ben Mansour: No other way around?
[22.01.25, 13:11:35] ~ Bazeed: only legit way i know of
[22.01.25, 13:22:30] ~ Ben Mansour: Ok thanks
[22.01.25, 14:11:07] ~ Samy: Hey guys, our supplier told us today that apparently the factory messed up and was only able to send out 50% of our stock, and now they are on vacation. This means that my stock will end in about 5 Days, on the 27th. The factory is back and can ship new orders on the 8th of february, and then it will take about 4 Days until it reach my agents warehouse, so february 12 new items can be sent out. In total, without shipping times that means 16 Days processing time. Then another 10-15 for the shipping. Would you guys continue to sell in this situation, or scale down heavily/ turn off the ads and risk losing momentum later on.
[22.01.25, 14:21:53] ~ Gideon: If youre sold out youll lose momentum anyway. Better lower the adspend to increase profability. See if you can send with fedex and lower shipping time. Also you can work with a preorder and give some extra discount or freebie when out of stock
[22.01.25, 14:24:36] ~ Samy: Alright thanks
[22.01.25, 14:25:58] ~ Ben Mansour: Or you can keep selling on same volume
[22.01.25, 14:26:08] ~ Ben Mansour: Set up email flow when stock is out
[22.01.25, 14:26:19] ~ Ben Mansour: We are out stocl due to hesvy demand….
[22.01.25, 14:26:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Would you want a refund or wait and get a small gift
[22.01.25, 14:27:08] ~ Ben Mansour: Prepare a small 1-2$ gift
[22.01.25, 14:27:12] ~ Ben Mansour: We did it before
[22.01.25, 14:27:16] ~ Ben Mansour: 90% of people
[22.01.25, 14:27:17] ~ Ben Mansour: Wait
[22.01.25, 14:28:32] ~ M A N U E L: anyone else here got hit with the health and wellness meta update?
[22.01.25, 14:29:35] ~ Steve: seeing some people running custom events in FB to get around it
[22.01.25, 14:29:55] ~ Gord JB: We’ve had this a few times 

Frame as a pre-order or say delivery is delayed due to increased demand 

Make sure it’s written your product page & in your order confirmation email so you can refer back to it if needed 

Also provide cash discount to the angry customers if they reach out 

& if you can afford free gifts then do it too
[22.01.25, 14:31:53] ~ Samy: Thanks🙏🏻
[22.01.25, 14:36:17] ~ Samy: Thanks bro, how many days did you sell without stock?
[22.01.25, 14:37:34] ~ Ben Mansour: Around 1 month
[22.01.25, 14:45:12] ~ Matt: Any recommendations for killer creative meta agencies? I’m looking to hire one asap to help add more volume so want to compare between a few.
[22.01.25, 14:57:06] ~ Growg: 2 options you can go bro- 

i) You can simple take the order and cancel it after some days saying ‘Sorry, We couldn’t fulfill your order due sudden increased demand, We maintain Quality & …….’ And Give some like 15-20% discount coupoun to use after 1 month when you’ll notify them about stock. 

Simultaneously when you do this email every client, Do some ugc and Ads saying - ‘Thank You Everyone, We are Out Of Stock and we are overwhelmed for this and appericate everyone who made this happen, Without you we haven’t reached till here’ …. Something like this. 

In Conclusion - Emotional Pitch, Thanking them for this sucess and registering for Pre Order. 


ii) Slowdown everything as everyone is suggesting but show everything is Out of Stock / Will sell fast & You don’t know when stock will be back. 

Goal is to create ripple effect which leads to more order and recover your loss at current once you get operational.

Hope it makes sense. ‎<This message was edited>

[22.01.25, 20:19:29] ~ chris: Hey everyone! Quick question, what are your average prices for a tiktok creator collaboration video? Is 1 cent per follower reasonable or how do you guys calculate this?
[22.01.25, 20:25:20] ~ Joey Horton: I would recommend if they are affiliates through the TikTok seller central to do a percentage of what they sell, I do 12.5% of the sale but have seen up to 20%. If it is just a random TikTok creator I would offer a certain amount per post they make which you can use.
[22.01.25, 20:33:44] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩
[22.01.25, 20:35:04] ~ chris: Sounds good. Since we are not selling in the US currently we dont have tiktok shop but we will definitely get into that later. We just contacted alot of small creators but prices vary quite depending on the followers they have. So if anyone knows a good baseline would be awesome
[22.01.25, 21:21:26] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey dark lords. We have another community of Ecom entrepreneurs doing at least $1 mil a month. If you want to be added to that community please react to this post with emoji

[23.01.25, 4:55:39] ~ Landon: Hey guys, is anyone else having trouble importing ads into the ASC recently? I’ve tried importing ads, but the option doesn’t even appear, no ads show up to import. Even the usual suggested ads option doesn’t display anything. 

Also, duplicating to an existing campaign doesn’t work because ASC can only have one ad set. This issue has just started recently ‎<This message was edited>
[23.01.25, 7:49:22] ~ ...: Have you tried creating ASC and closing the window without Discarding 

And go the ads and copy them and paste/import them into Existing Camp and select the ASC campaign you previously created.

This should work
[23.01.25, 10:11:42] ~ Bazeed: if anyones looking for trained + cheap DR styled video editor, Hmu, he can take on couple more projects for the month
[23.01.25, 10:16:08] ~ ...: Anyone can recommend Third Party Dispute Resolution company that had higher winning rate
[23.01.25, 12:20:44] ~ Filippo: Any difference in US card approval rate with Shopify payments US vs EU?
[23.01.25, 13:11:23] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Is anyone who’s doing Meta Ads experiencing terrible CVR’s today?
[23.01.25, 13:12:40] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Usually on the 2.5% mark
[23.01.25, 13:12:52] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Today under 0.5
[23.01.25, 13:13:31] ~ RS: Very good for me today. Better than last 7 days
[23.01.25, 13:15:39] ~ Steve: Record days nearly every day
[23.01.25, 13:15:55] ~ Steve: see lots of people struggling Q1 on FB though, but its been awesome for us
[23.01.25, 13:17:24] ~ Steve: creeping towards 20k days for us now, steady 3x ROAS, sometimes slightly lower
[23.01.25, 13:17:37] ~ Steve: hoping to get a consistently above 15k rest of week as we push spend, lets see
[23.01.25, 13:17:41] ~ Steve: but overall, very good performance
[23.01.25, 13:24:42] ~ Nicolò: we had a great start too, with significantly lower fb adv costs compared to q4, however overnight it plummeted 30% and even now we are trying to bring it back up to speed like early january on 25k days but it doesn't want to know, we are doing break even days and days in profit of 10/15% max
[23.01.25, 13:27:16] ~ Zsombor: Yeah same today
[23.01.25, 13:27:24] ~ Zsombor: But it happens sometimes
[23.01.25, 13:34:25] ~ Ben Mansour: sometimes bad days can happen, don't decrease budget because of it
[23.01.25, 13:34:38] ~ Ben Mansour: if ads performance starts to drop consistently
[23.01.25, 13:35:06] ~ Ben Mansour: push new creatives with new copy (fb text, headline)
[23.01.25, 13:35:21] ~ Ben Mansour: even same creatives with minor changes
[23.01.25, 13:37:26] ~ Damjan Topalovic: thanks guys, keep crushing it🚀
[23.01.25, 13:39:04] ~ Matt: Where are you seeing big wins? Certain types of creatives or landing page tests?
[23.01.25, 13:39:21] ~ Steve: ads, better and better ads
[23.01.25, 13:39:32] ~ Rick: New offer? ‎<This message was edited>
[23.01.25, 13:39:39] ~ Steve: ads we shoot ourselves, iterations each week, new ad concepts, taking angles our competitors haven’t thought of
[23.01.25, 13:39:52] ~ Steve: same offer, just better and better ads, new video editors, more creative styles
[23.01.25, 13:39:54] ~ Steve: its all just ads
[23.01.25, 13:40:14] ~ Rick: Ok nice
[23.01.25, 13:42:01] ~ Rick: But if all my data from meta ads are improved 
But my cr has fallen down, is it an offer problem? Price problem?
[23.01.25, 13:42:32] ~ Rick: Why I have to test more ads if the traffic doesn’t convert anymore?
[23.01.25, 13:44:02] ~ Steve: could be your offer, could be advertorial fatigued, could need better ads on new angle
[23.01.25, 13:45:12] ~ Steve: our ADV humms along nicely, need to get a new test going soon. Our motto is keep it as simple as possible until we start hitting 250k months.

No major upsells, no checkout champ, no 14 different A/B tests.

Just 1 product, lots of strong creative ads, good advertorial, and push
[23.01.25, 13:45:44] ~ Steve: got this advice from a friend and was best thing we did, just focus until 250k/mo, everything else is distraction. We’re almost there now, and ready to add 2nd and 3rd products in Feb
[23.01.25, 13:46:10] ~ Steve: this brand is 4 months old, almost 5
[23.01.25, 13:46:48] ~ Rick: Yes I’m doing like 600k month
[23.01.25, 13:46:56] ~ Rick: So I’m know what you are saying
[23.01.25, 13:47:19] ~ Rick: Same thing we do
[23.01.25, 13:47:57] ~ Bazeed: 3roas in us or eu?
[23.01.25, 13:48:04] ~ Steve: US only
[23.01.25, 13:48:25] ~ Steve: 2.5-3, some times way over 3, some times around 2.5, but pretty constent 2.5 days
[23.01.25, 13:48:31] ~ Bazeed: nice
[23.01.25, 13:48:42] ~ Rick: We already have the 2 and 3 product 
We need our real CR back 🥲
[23.01.25, 13:54:15] ~ Matt: And are you doing a specific type of as more and more or just having wide creative variation I.e. vsls mostly or lots of different types?
[23.01.25, 14:10:34] ~ Steve: VSLs and statics. I write all scripts myself, storyboard myself, often shoot them with footage myself if I have a creative idea, and do all voiceovers - unless they are UGC ones of course
[23.01.25, 14:22:47] ~ Rick: And where you study? Do you have someone to suggest?
[23.01.25, 14:24:01] ~ Steve: me - writing writing copy for 8 and 9 figure brands for 12+ years
[23.01.25, 14:24:20] ~ Steve: pretty big advantage tbh lol
[23.01.25, 14:25:03] ~ Rick: GG
[23.01.25, 14:25:30] ~ Steve: just keep writing copy - often the best copywriters out there arent copywriters they are brand owners who had no other choice but to write copy and put their own money behind it
[23.01.25, 14:25:34] ~ Steve: you learn pretty quick that way
[23.01.25, 14:27:00] ~ Rick: Thanks man
[23.01.25, 14:27:04] ~ Rick: Appreciate
[23.01.25, 14:27:53] ~ Steve: whenever you write a script, go through your hook and lead and ask yourself “is this the most interesting way I can present this idea or hook?"
[23.01.25, 14:28:17] ~ Steve: i do that all the time. Too many times the idea is right, but people present it in such a stale, boring way
[23.01.25, 15:11:34] ~ Aman: Do you think using tools like claude or ChatGPT compete with actual copywriters?
[23.01.25, 15:12:07] ~ Andrea: No because you don't know what good copy is supposed to be like
[23.01.25, 15:12:24] ~ Andrea: It can be a helpful tool but not (yet) replace a copywriter
[23.01.25, 15:14:47] ~ Bazeed: my brand does 200k months with claude.

I do take my own written advertorials tho and tell claude to understand and rewrite using the same structure and then refine anything thats not up to the mark.

i made plenty vsls fully with ai scripts that did 10k easy days
[23.01.25, 15:14:56] ~ Mason Schulze: I've always been sceptical to try to hire a copywriter because, for sure, they would use AI aswell in some way now
[23.01.25, 15:15:18] ~ Aman: Me too that's why I ask
[23.01.25, 15:15:40] ~ Bazeed: this is true i think if youre A+ copywriter u can write bangers with ai cause you know what will hit and what wont
[23.01.25, 15:15:47] ~ Aman: You'd be surprised I've hired top guys for others to tell me after they used claude
[23.01.25, 15:17:11] Topi: becoming good at copy takes literally 3-6 months. Just block time each morning 4-5 hours to write and read some basic books. I don’t write so much anymore but it helps so much running the business when I can understand where we are possibly lacking
[23.01.25, 15:17:15] ~ Steve: Wrong approach. You should want everyone in your business using AI if they can. It makes everything faster.

i use A.I every day
[23.01.25, 15:17:48] ~ Bazeed: yeah i dosent take a genius to be a copywriter imo,

i only spent 6-8 months learning copy and going balls deep with anything i could find, and wrote vsls and advertorials with help of ai

eugene schwartz would be pissed if he saw how easy it is to write his level of copy today with ai
[23.01.25, 15:17:51] ~ Steve: if a client or someone told me they don’t want me using A.I. that would be the end of the call. I just wouldn’t take them serious
[23.01.25, 15:17:59] ~ Mason Schulze: Saying this because I do it myself instead instead of outsourcing
[23.01.25, 15:18:44] ~ Steve: most A level copywriters are not using A.I. to get great copy.

They are using A.I to produce more and be more efficient. They use their superior marketing skills to take the script the rest of the way
[23.01.25, 15:19:32] ~ Mason Schulze: Tried to outsource it before, could never find anyone that I read their stuff, and it clicked
[23.01.25, 15:43:59] ~ Filippo: @⁨~Bazeed⁩ what steps do u follow to produce copy with AI?
[23.01.25, 15:59:58] ~ Aman: Anyone have good funnelish devs they can connect me with?
[23.01.25, 16:01:46] Topi: yeh
[23.01.25, 16:04:28] ~ Robin: Hey Topi, can you connect me to? We are looking for one also to bring in 🙏🏻
[23.01.25, 16:05:47] Topi: dm dm
[23.01.25, 16:49:03] ~ Growg: The whole conversation of copy should be in 2 categories 

i) A list copywriter who knows and understands Marketing and if they use Claude their copy will print. 

ii) Anyone who think themselves as copywriter and doesn’t understand concept of Marketing and uses AI , for them no AI tool can do any good or beat wether Claude, Chatgpt. 

So the core concept is understanding the market, Target Audience and communicating it in a way that it sells without much pressure/looking salesy. 

And A list copywriter understands all these and knows better about market.

Thats why now a days you can see Quality of Copy is shit and AI generated in newbiew copywriter. 

Whereas A list are making more money. ‎<This message was edited>

I’m Jason fron the Netherlands. Thanks for having me in this group. I’m excited to learn, connect en contribute alongside you guys!
[23.01.25, 19:34:52] ~ Filippo: So they didn’t accept you yet

[23.01.25, 19:38:03] ~ Filippo: Yes please, cause I know it’s better to use a HK corp for that
[23.01.25, 19:54:59] ~ Landon: What do you mean by importing? Do you mean duplicating? Like go to another campaign at the ad level and then duplicate that ad to the ASC campaign?
[23.01.25, 19:55:39] ~ Landon: Or click copy on the ad and then click paste on the ad level of the ASC? ‎<This message was edited>
[23.01.25, 20:44:25] ~ ...: Yes but first you need to create ASC and do not publish it just close then you copy the ads into that ASC campaign
[23.01.25, 21:12:54] ~ Landon: So basically just make a small change in the ASC so it looks to be edited, because I already and ASC. Then you go to the ad level (ASC) click the checkmark on an existing ad and paste the ad correct?
[23.01.25, 21:16:47] ~ ...: Bro lets say you have
ABO ad set ad1
Create ASC and do not publish it

Go to click on ad1 and Dup it then you will have option to choose existing campaign then choose this ASC created and it will reopen ASC and then you can publish it
[23.01.25, 21:21:13] ~ Parker Godfrey: Last 2 days in my CBO, I was at a 2.75+ ROAS so I raised my budget from $900 to $1200 and today it has completely turned off... not one purchase so far. Nothing changed, just a budget increase. Is it just reoptimizing or what??
[23.01.25, 21:36:18] ~ Jason: Happened to me too when i increased budget with 25% (in your case with 33%). In my case it needed 1-2 days to stabilize. ‎<This message was edited>
[23.01.25, 21:40:26] ~ Dorian: 0 purchase all the day long ? when you increase your budget it's normal to see a performance decline the next day or couple of day. Meta need to stabilize but if you have 0 purchase it's not normal i think
[23.01.25, 21:42:31] ~ Parker Godfrey: Yeah it’s 11:40am my time… just bizarre. And website CVR went from a 1.9 to a .4 today. I’ve seen natural ebbs and flows before so hopefully it picks back up through out the day
[23.01.25, 21:43:48] ~ Dorian: if u have cashflow just wait and see if performance increase in the end of the day or tomorrow
[23.01.25, 21:54:09] ~ Parker Godfrey: Yeah thats what Im going to do. Thanks!

[23.01.25, 22:16:34] ~ Ben Mansour: but not accurate
[23.01.25, 22:16:52] ~ Ben Mansour: what i recommend is pay insider to spy on their ad accounts
[23.01.25, 22:17:04] ~ Ben Mansour: you can know how much they spend on ads

[23.01.25, 22:21:31] Topi: just dm
[23.01.25, 22:22:18] ~ Bryan T: you could also do the classic method of purchasing from their store, looking at the order number, waiting 24 hours and then purchasing again to see how many orders they get in a 24 hour period by comparing the 2 order numbers
[23.01.25, 22:22:56] ~ Bryan T: or waiting a week, etc
[23.01.25, 23:39:18] ~ Landon: Ok, that makes sense. Thanks

[24.01.25, 0:22:37] ~ Austin: Does anyone here have experience in buying their own commercial property for manufacturing expansion? If so would love to connect.
[24.01.25, 0:50:35] ~ Christopher Murphy: Hey guys, started scaling a product into a seperate CBO scaling campaign on Facebook. Took all the winners from testing campaign and moved them into scaling.

For some reason my CPM is double on my scaling campaign than what my Creative testing campaign is. It’s all the same targeting so no clue what’s happening. 

Anyone know how to fix this? - getting terrible ROAS on my scaling campaign rn because it’s costing double to reach someone.
[24.01.25, 0:53:27] Topi: Did you use post ID’s?
[24.01.25, 0:53:42] Topi: if you launched today, let it run 2-3 days and observe CPMs
[24.01.25, 0:59:06] ~ Christopher Murphy: Duplicated - post ID’s only worked for one format of the ad and I wanted to run 4:5 and 9:16. Unless there’s a way to use post ID’s to get both formats for an ad that I’m unaware of I’d love to hear it
[24.01.25, 0:59:39] ~ Brian: Reoptimizing, this is normal
[24.01.25, 1:00:31] Topi: Always use post ID when want to scale winner. At least this used be the best practice when I was media buying. For me launching in any other way sounds madness
[24.01.25, 1:01:17] ~ Matt: Anyone running cost cap campaign + a lowest cost campaign in their accounts at same time? I’ve seen some people say it’s not as affective for cost cap campaign if you have a lowest cost one running too?
[24.01.25, 2:54:57] ~ Rustam: Honestly whenever I turn off lowest cost campaigns, my asc cc campaign performs better and net profit is higher. I now even do all tests in one main asc. But max adspend that I had a day on this account  so far was $5k, so can’t know for sure. ‎<This message was edited>

[24.01.25, 8:14:48] ~ Num: Can anyone recommend a good agency for ad accounts, please
[24.01.25, 10:07:20] ~ UHO: Agencies will cost you a fortune. I never use them, use a freelancer Instead. The one I know handles everything from designing my creatives to launching the ads, at a fraction of the price. Let me know if you need his deets.

[24.01.25, 21:22:15] ~ Cisco: Hello everyone,

I have a serious problem. My friend received a fine of $900K because he shipped products, and the supplier wrongly declared them as pet toys instead of supplements. The goods were worth over $500K. To make things worse, the supplier has blocked him, and as we all know, the U.S. doesn’t really take action against China in these cases.

He has an LLC, but as far as I know, the LLC might not protect him in this situation. Do you have any advice? It’s urgent, and I would greatly appreciate your help in advance.

Thank you very much!
[24.01.25, 21:24:28] ~ Omar: no way on the packing slips the supplier didnt show ur friend

[24.01.25, 21:32:48] ~ Guy Edan: It’s a very common practice by suppliers to label to products as different ones to lower import tax. I’d even say most suppliers do that. Just unlucky to get caught. Id speak to a lawyer if I was u to see what u can do
[24.01.25, 21:33:10] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨Greg Sourcing China Trybello⁩ what would you advise here
[24.01.25, 21:38:14] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: @⁨~Cisco⁩ - I’m assuming your friend was the consignee on the shipment of this product. Does he have all the customs entry forms by chance from all the shipments in the past? Was the notice from US Customs Border Control? Dm me when you can and I’ll need some more info so that I can refer an international trade attorney and I can try to find some things out from my customs broker partners.
[24.01.25, 21:46:05] ~ Cisco: Thank you so much for your help and your kind offer! I’m currently still working on clarifying everything, but if I don’t make progress, I’d love to reach out to you. Thanks again for your support – I’ll get in touch if I need further assistance!

[25.01.25, 0:37:06] ~ Charles: True
[25.01.25, 0:58:23] ~ Cisco: I’ll ask my friend, and I hope this never happens to yall.
[25.01.25, 1:07:59] ~ Austin: Does anyone have good SEO guy / agency...please connect
[25.01.25, 4:41:16] ~ Ak Kurji: Anybody do print on demand here?
[25.01.25, 4:51:23] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Not as a primary product. Lots of tshirts, hoodies, and other swag that we offer as upsells.
[25.01.25, 5:32:47] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey dark lords! If you haven’t seen my partners @⁨~Mark⁩ latest video, check it out. From the idea to an amazing ad for ecommerce product in few minutes! Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERs3vo6vMhM
[25.01.25, 15:26:34] ~ Omar Tayara: Hey guys, which software do u use to spy on competitor’s ads
[25.01.25, 16:41:34] ~ Ben Mansour: Adspy
[25.01.25, 16:54:59] ~ Nick Jansen: Hey everyone, my best friend from Belgium ( doing a few million per year) just woke up to 70% of his ads being rejected overnight. Does anyone here have a FAST way to get in touch with Meta support?
[25.01.25, 16:56:13] ~ Phil: Tell him to click help, then click hacked asset, choose his ad account and then should be able to open a live chat straight away and tell them to call him asap
[25.01.25, 16:56:15] ~ Phil: Could be competition mass reporting his videos
[25.01.25, 16:56:53] ~ Nick Jansen: Great man thanks for advise
[25.01.25, 16:57:09] ~ Phil: Tell him also not to click for review. Let the meta team do the reviews manually he should get it all back
[25.01.25, 16:59:32] ~ Ben Mansour: people who advertise in big 6 - us canada | uk ireland | australia new zealand in same campaigns or 1 country per campaign?
[25.01.25, 17:00:31] ~ Phil: I think test both. Most people say 1 country per camp but then others do very well having all in one. I think spend will just get sent to one country regardless if all in one and then you can open seperate camps just in your winning region
[25.01.25, 17:02:07] ~ Ben Mansour: got it thanks
[25.01.25, 17:39:32] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey ecom lords! One of my friends who’s running 8 figures e-commerce business is looking for a head of performance marketing / head of growth. Great comp ($150-200k per year) and growth potential for a right person. If you are that person or know someone who might be please dm me directly and I’ll intro you. Also if you refer someone who gets hired, 3k referral bonus ;)
[25.01.25, 20:03:57] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone has good copy for post purchase upsells?
[25.01.25, 20:04:37] ~ Ben Mansour: My current upsell offer price is 40$ and take rate is 10% is that good?
[25.01.25, 22:12:36] ~ Austin: Has anyone here trained or hired a media buyer for their account? Would love to know how that went.
[25.01.25, 22:18:11] Topi: - want to hire someone with experience spending more than you’re currently spending. 

- Must be obsessed, media buying is 7 days a week job

- Want to tie in profit based comission. Prefetably higher comission/ lower retainer contract 

- Want to ask proof of success previously and prefetablly reach out to previous company (fake screenshots etc) 

- Want to hire person who understands sales funnel as holistic level, not a person who presses buttons only 

- Fast trial, cannot get things working? Find new one


These are few my learnings about media buyers so far
[25.01.25, 22:20:29] ~ Austin: Very helpful thank you
[25.01.25, 22:22:10] Topi: Go buy from companies you know have amazing upsell game, record looms / screenshot, your current KPI hard to comment as don’t see the full picture but generally speaking doesn’t sound too high
[25.01.25, 23:18:50] ~ Santi Roa: I went the opposite route. Hired jr people with a lot of potential and trained them. If you play it long term this becomes more sustainable.
Compensation can be less aggressive
[25.01.25, 23:57:36] Topi: We have few examples in our business this went well, but biggest growth definitely hiring people better than us
[26.01.25, 0:04:44] ~ Santi Roa: Both ways are correct. It's just a strategy decision
[26.01.25, 0:06:38] ~ Lucas Alves: exactly
[26.01.25, 0:08:24] ~ Steve: I see your point but experience has taught me this is not the sustainable approach.

The reason is because you really have to have an excellent nose to sniff out great talent early and invest in growing those ones. Most people don't have that so they invest time and money investing In someone who will not become an A player.

The other drawback is you take a D player and turn them into an A player. Awesome. But now they have become an A player for the first time in their career meaning the can go work wherever the want for whatever money they want. And they often (not always) choose to leave
[26.01.25, 0:09:14] ~ Steve: Where hiring an A player, yes it's expensive, but they are already coming to you by choice, and expected to do an A level job which accelerates your business to the maximum making them a high ROI hire that you don't have to invest training dollars in
[26.01.25, 0:09:51] ~ Santi Roa: I my case I consciously make the decision to build a great culture, a very positive work environment, and having a strong recruiting funnel and process.
Then, with that, I am able to hire top talent, with a bit less specific experience than needed, but the capabilities to execute and improve fast. I keep investing in them, and people don't leave
[26.01.25, 0:10:04] ~ Steve: You will inevitably have people in your business that you train up and should but you need to consider the time and cost of that training and the cost of the mistakes they make along the way vs just hiring a fucking killer to come in and kill
[26.01.25, 0:12:40] ~ Steve: In the end it depends on position too. I'm not interested in hiring a Jr media buyer and then spending months training them up. I want an experienced person who knows what they're doing, and I'm happy to compensate them and keep bumping their comp and structure every 3 months or so to keep them happy
[26.01.25, 0:13:57] Topi: The positive side of hiring junior and coaching = extreme loyalty (my experience) 

Downside = the times I’ve tried to do this intentionally, at some point it went wrong and now as I’m getting more matured, I see the opportunity cost that this causes. 

The times a junior became senior, it happened naturally over time almost by accident. Right person + they had time to grow, that part of business wasn’t causing bottleneck while they were growing
[26.01.25, 3:32:14] ~ Lucas Alves: was talking w/ @⁨~Austin⁩ and sharing some info about my clients here in brazil (i own an ecom agency too)

unfortunately I still don't own any brand that Google can be a relevant traffic/rev source due to the niches i work with

[26.01.25, 21:17:27] ~ Ben Mansour: I‘m going to a/b test it
[26.01.25, 21:24:28] ~ Davide: If you tell me which upsell are you running is more logical to think about it
[26.01.25, 21:25:15] ~ Davide: More of the same offer, or “done for you” like another product that completes the offer in front end?
[26.01.25, 21:49:27] ~ Ben Mansour: Same product
[26.01.25, 21:49:38] ~ Ben Mansour: My product sells in bundles

In peak days, we plan to do 50k orders/day this year. If I am not wrong we need about 30 to 50 pallets of inventory space.(not sure bc my team manages that)
Can you handle that? I'll put you in contact with my team ‎<This message was edited>

[27.01.25, 5:44:46] ~ Jonas Ma: hey guys! We are searching for some influencers for our brand in the USA. How do you find your influencers? Agencys or somehow diffrent?
[27.01.25, 5:51:43] ~ Mark Wagner: You should test this but it's normally in the range of 15-20% false positive rate on Ethoca alerts specifically. I run Disputifier and there are issues with false positives on virtually every other alert provider because of the way Ethoca works. Basically Ethoca inflates their alert count / revenue by sending "suspected fraud" notifications through as normal alerts. All other providers just send it as a chargeback notification and bill you for it. We filter these out because they're mostly bullshit and not actually going to turn into a chargeback

[27.01.25, 9:30:11] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: How did they perform? Found a similar agency but they’re all ‘actors’
[27.01.25, 9:31:58] ~ Denis Mihin: Some of my list is also actors. It mostly depends on how good are your instructions. They perform great for me but if you have bland instructions don't expect a miracle

how do you know when the ad account ends for the US to properly calculate the profits? - confused here ‎<This message was edited>
[27.01.25, 15:11:35] ~ Yente Dhooge: Practically difficult - but a good solution is to make your scaling decisions based on 2 - 3 days of performance

I'm using reconvert, but it doesn't show post purchase on payments done with different currency and customers that pay with shop pay
[27.01.25, 18:51:55] ~ Henry: How do you go about keeping the senior person in the company? I know it’s a lot harder when it comes to retaining them
[27.01.25, 19:17:52] ~ Arad Khazabi: what do you do with creators that argue with you after asking for revisions and not properly doing what was asking for, putting someone else on fault for the quality of the results - especially asking $220 to create that content

this communication was done per email, means I didn't pay in advance ‎<This message was edited>
[27.01.25, 19:23:22] ~ UHO: It’s not so hard when you create a positive culture and enhance incentives.
[27.01.25, 19:31:42] ~ Steve: I have never found it that hard because at the end of the day, if you attract an A player, they are chosing your team over 10 other options they could have, so thats a great start
[27.01.25, 19:31:55] ~ Steve: the way i see people lose top players is bringing them in, and then micromanaging them
[27.01.25, 19:32:17] ~ Steve: you bring in a star to be a star. You don’t bring in Messi and then tell Messi go play defence and how to defend lol

[27.01.25, 20:40:48] ~ chris: Hey everyone, is there anyone interested in going to the Elite mastermind 28th? Dm since you can bring +1 which saves some money
[27.01.25, 20:40:56] ~ Mark Wagner: Unfortunately there’s no way to tell from your dashboard. You could theoretically reach out to customers to ask if they charged back, but not all customers will be truthful and it’s already too late at that point. The best option is just using a provider that filters fraud alerts
[27.01.25, 21:03:38] ~ Zsombor: What provider does that?
[27.01.25, 21:08:17] ~ Nikita: Disputifier
[27.01.25, 21:50:19] ~ Mark Wagner: Yeah exactly
[27.01.25, 22:25:13] ~ Zsombor: Thanks guys
[27.01.25, 23:12:51] ~ Mike M: This is a difficult one that we had to learn a couple of hard lessons from. We realized A good creative could be worth tens of thousands in revenue. Detailing exactly what you expect from them as if you’re speaking to 1 year old is essential in the front end. On the back end either offering to pay a revision fee or severing the job entirely is the only way out. They’re notorious for their lack of accountability unless they are on fiverr/upwork. Is their creative that good? Do you want to keep working with them? Etc.
[27.01.25, 23:15:09] ~ Arad Khazabi: No I don’t see working with them again

I have an eye of what I am looking for and if it doesn’t match it, I’ll immediately realize it - knowing wether it was worth it or not, which in this scenario is not worth it

[28.01.25, 0:57:59] ~ Davide: The thing is, how do you recognize that they are not what you are currently looking for before you start working? 
Many UGC/actresses seem good, great in terms of creativity and speaking to the audience, but when they work with you they often deliver mediocre work... 
Maybe we need to be as detailed as we can in the brief, but the fact is that even they have to put in all the skills they have....
And sometimes I see shortcomings or "mistakes" that you don't expect. 
Why don't you expect them? Because she is an actress, she already has a lot of experience, she seems perfect for your audience etc etc. 
And afterwards you are disappointed, in addition to paying a high amount of money.
[28.01.25, 1:10:33] ~ Mike M: You’re asking how do we know for sure they are or are not worth the effort? Hopefully they align with your avatar and you have more than one working on a creative at a time so all your eggs arent in one basket. speed is the key. It takes a lot of patience working with some of them. We also plan the time frame for them of the video. We send script, setting, demeanor, tone that we expect. If we are paying 300+ for a creative, the creator gets 5 pages of direction and we check in with them on fiverr until it is delivered so there arent any issues. ‎<This message was edited>

[28.01.25, 20:43:35] ~ Austin: How do you guys manage ad comments? I'm thinking there's a big opportunity to planting positive comments to create social proof the product works / people love it increasing CR, would love to know if you guys do this / how you do it.
[28.01.25, 22:43:22] ~ Matt: Anyone know a software to pull scripts from meta ads from smaller brands not on foreplay or atria?
[28.01.25, 22:55:57] ~ Christopher Murphy: What’s a good success rate on PayPal for funnelish? Mine is sitting at 56% compared to my stripe which is at 94%. Is that normal? Or should I be alarmed
[28.01.25, 23:00:23] ~ Andrea: You should be alarmewd
[28.01.25, 23:00:37] ~ Andrea: Usually sits at 75-85%
[28.01.25, 23:01:15] ~ Christopher Murphy: Damn okay, will look into it. What’s usually the cause for this?
[28.01.25, 23:01:58] ~ Phil: Alex sent a video of his biz partner making a vid and he mentions an app. Not sure if you have seen the video
[28.01.25, 23:02:01] ~ Phil: @⁨~Matt⁩
[28.01.25, 23:02:37] ~ michael: Also have this problem but with iDeal my purchase fail rate is 38% anyone else experienced this and knows solution?
[28.01.25, 23:05:00] ~ Austin: Does comment deletion effect algorithms for ad performance? What about planting good comments? If it does cause any effect how severe? I think comment section have more of an impact on the customer than we think as it's the only thing not fully brand control in the Ads and as we know social proof hits hard.
[28.01.25, 23:09:23] ~ Mert M: https://www.beey.io/
[28.01.25, 23:14:26] ~ Matt: 🤝
[28.01.25, 23:15:22] ~ Matt: I’ve been testing adding positive comments (only 5 at a time) and not seen much difference so far however my best performing ad also has 100s of comments on it so I’m sure it does make some effect
[28.01.25, 23:20:12] ~ Kyle Twohill: What about deleting/hiding negative comments do you find that fb "shadow bans" your ad for this/ any negative effects?
[28.01.25, 23:22:29] ~ Ben Mansour: no completely normal
[28.01.25, 23:22:41] ~ Ben Mansour: you can hide comments with certain keywords automatically
[28.01.25, 23:23:46] ~ Phil: I was doing this, everyday hiding comments and didn’t affect anything one bit. Was scaling hard still
[28.01.25, 23:24:00] ~ Matt: We always hide them and don’t see any difference
[28.01.25, 23:24:34] ~ Phil: You can also use Brandwise. It’s an app that lets you log into all your advertising platforms and you see all the comments in one place and you can hide and delete comments from there in one click. Not having to do it individually
[28.01.25, 23:24:45] ~ Matt: I personally can’t see how positive comments wouldn’t have a positive effect on a winning ad, it’s social proof
[28.01.25, 23:26:06] ~ michael: You dont notice worse traffic or penalty from fb?
[28.01.25, 23:32:31] ~ Matt: No
[28.01.25, 23:35:25] ~ Matt: Anyone know if it’s legally ok to call out other brands in ads if stating a fact? I.e. an ad with a section covering how most competitors use artificial ingredients and then showing the brands that include them
[28.01.25, 23:55:33] ~ Aman: Not allowed
[28.01.25, 23:55:57] ~ Aman: Using any brands names in advertising is copyright
[28.01.25, 23:55:58] ~ Wouter: As anyone seen a massive drop in performance since Monday?
[28.01.25, 23:56:11] ~ Aman: Been shit all month lol
[28.01.25, 23:56:16] ~ Wouter: Wonder what it is
[28.01.25, 23:56:46] ~ Aman: I spoke to a big brand owner few days ago
[28.01.25, 23:56:59] ~ Aman: Dropped from $70k to $10k a day in spend
[28.01.25, 23:57:19] ~ Aman: Says most rev in California meant since the fires people aren't buying
[28.01.25, 23:58:13] ~ Aman: My guess is that people don't have $$
[29.01.25, 0:00:18] ~ Wouter: Surely that’s not it. There is 350 million people in the USA. The people affected in California is like 0.5% or something
[29.01.25, 0:05:14] ~ Steve: The things people come up with as reasons why their revenue is down or ads aren't working always stuns me
[29.01.25, 1:00:01] ~ Wouter: 😂
[29.01.25, 1:00:04] ~ Wouter: Same 😂
[29.01.25, 1:00:36] ~ Wouter: I was just wondering if anyone has experienced any it as we had a great January so far and it just stopped on monday for 3 brands
‎[29.01.25, 1:39:50] ~ UHO: ‎video omitted
[29.01.25, 2:02:08] ~ Ben Mansour: Can you use their product image blurred in statics? For example us vs them
[29.01.25, 2:03:36] ~ Aman: His product was beach related and over 70% of daily revenue came from cali so makes sense
[29.01.25, 2:03:51] ~ Aman: Yes as long as name isn't showing
[29.01.25, 2:32:04] ~ Mithiran: I actually have noticed that whenever there is a big event, like the fire, for 2-3 days exactly when it happens, ROAS drops. And the same thing happened for the hurricane as well tbh
[29.01.25, 3:17:12] ~ Brian: Anybody done a Power lift study before on META? What kind of questions do people typically ask on these?
[29.01.25, 7:36:56] ~ Austin: Regarding using names in marketing if a YT reviewer reviews the products, pull the exact image off your product page and then uses it as the thumbnail is there any action on the YT platform or legally that can get that removed? the product name and the brand name are both trademarked and both names are used in his title, thumbnail and description. Some guidance here would be great.
[29.01.25, 8:18:14] ~ Jeb: Austin be careful with this, I would ask chat gpt with this. I previously got in trouble with this. But i wouldn’t go past being suggestive. I wouldn’t poke at their trademarks more than insulting/ being suggestive.
[29.01.25, 9:07:17] ~ Matt: What if you are simply holding the different packaging of competitor brands and showing logos etc and saying “this one contains loads of artificial flavours and ingredients” - a factually true statement
[29.01.25, 9:33:08] ~ Jeb: Im really not sure, maybe chat gpt it
[29.01.25, 12:46:31] ~ N: Did anyone here have a solutuon for overcoming new health policy thing by fb
[29.01.25, 12:50:13] ~ Mert M: no experience, but heard some guys talking about making costum event on purchase

[29.01.25, 12:53:18] ~ Mert M: but also no personal experience with this fiverr guy, so its own risk working

Do you set rewards if certain KPIs are met, any bonuses? Incentives? Pay increases?
[31.01.25, 9:49:51] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Yes all team must be incentives
[31.01.25, 9:50:03] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: For editors I pay them extra $$$ for winning ads

[31.01.25, 9:50:41] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Anyone have incentive ideas for customer support? Thinking of paying per email what you guys think?
[31.01.25, 9:53:19] ~ Davide: Yes for sure
[31.01.25, 9:53:40] ~ Davide: I don't think of doing it that way... but more in terms of instructing him with new courses, other advanced skills etc etc. 
Or about how many videos he produces in terms of speed and quality
[31.01.25, 9:54:01] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: For sure
[31.01.25, 10:00:36] ~ Davide: Again, I would analyze the qualities of the responses and really how much value he brings to the businees, since he is in daily contact with customers and the prospect. 
Things like real information about the target audience, golden nuggets for it them and put in the ads

[31.01.25, 14:39:51] ~ Klemen: Hey guys, quick question!

We've been testing video ads against static images, and so far, videos are performing better across the funnel – more checkouts, higher engagement, and overall stronger metrics.

BUT – our IC2PUR CR is significantly worse compared to static images, even though the flow is exactly the same.

Has anyone experienced this before?
[31.01.25, 15:06:46] ~ Mark: Yeah man, I wouldn’t get too involved in the submetrics if it’s overall more profitable. But that’s happened to be before for sure

[1.02.25, 13:49:07] ~ Santi Roa: It depends based on industry
[1.02.25, 14:47:05] ~ Matthew Martorano: I think de minimus may still apply on lower value items.
[1.02.25, 15:43:36] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Yea. The 10% is really going to be nothing.  Plus if anyone in e-commerce is using this DDP method for shipping, which means you get a tracking number from FedEx or UPS, ur barely seeing a difference in price. 

For legitimate importing, the ten percent is most likely being added to the existing tariff categories.  There are categories that are tariff exempt, and then categories where you pay only 7.5%, 15%, and of course 25%.  So if it’s 10% on top of everything, not the end of the world. If it’s 10% on top of only the 25% category, that’s even better.  

If ur fulfilling from China, then you’re not even impacted because of the de minimus rule. That can still change, but again it’s not ruining your day.  There are things you can work out with the manufacturer to reduce your price anyway.
[1.02.25, 17:52:07] ~ Mithiran: Wouldn’t the 10% be added onto the DDP price
[1.02.25, 17:53:44] ~ Zvi: hey all started a new product in france getting mixed results each day could it be becouse i selected on the ads set up advantage + audiences VS just leaving it Broad without that setting ?
[1.02.25, 18:01:50] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: no it doesn’t really work that way, especially because of the way they price things out. They are charging per KG and its the shipping cost + taxes. They’re definitely under declaring the value of the goods too, which is why DDP rates are so much cheaper than doing legitimate shipping where you have your own customs broker importing the products for you and you’re receiving a customs enry form. 

The DDP service is basically a Chinese shipping service that is collecting as many different shipments and throwing it onto a container. Then when they handle the customs clearance, they are taking full responsibility of the importing, under declaring so that they are paying less in taxes. Then it goes to a warehouse, usually in LA, where all orders in the container gets separated and then scheduled for pickup by a UPS truck or Fedex track. That is why you’ll see no movement in your shipment until it actually gets picked up in LA. 

When you’re doing more legitimate sea freight shipping, theres a lot more to it. You have the sea freight cost, customs clearance cost, freight release cost, the actual duties/taxes ur paying (that’s when you have to provide a commercial invoice and packing list to your customs broker), and then trucking costs to the 3PL its going. For this type of shipping, you’re able to track the whole process. You can track the vessel that you’re shipment is on, you’re getting updates from your customs broker about the customs clearance process, and you’re getting true updates about the delivery schedules once the shipment is dispatched from customs. 

I have a client that we source machinery for them. They manufacture chocolate and candy nuts in the US. Let me share with you what a customs entry form looks like where you actually are paying the tariffs. They gave me approval to share it. One second.
‎[1.02.25, 18:03:25] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: kanary003 egsu.eisu.magu- 7501.pdf • ‎2 pages ‎document omitted
[1.02.25, 18:06:09] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: You can see here for this shipment that the tariff code for these chocolate machines are a 7.5% tariff. So assuming that Trump is slapping 10% on everything, it would be 17.5% now. Most of the consumer products that ecommerce businesses are selling fall under the 25% tariff category, which means that it would now be 35%. 

Again, DDP prices will increase most likely, but I don’t think it will simply be a 10% increase. It may be with some providers, but these shipping companies doing DDP know they need to be as competitive as possible so that they don’t lose market share from other providers.
[1.02.25, 18:08:00] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Lastly, you’ll notice in that document I sent above is an entry for machine parts. That particular HTS category falls under the 25% tariff. So asssuming Trump adds 10% to everything, then it would become 35%.
[1.02.25, 18:09:51] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: I do source for an ecommerce brand in the stationary product industry and some of his products are tariff exempt, which means he only pays duties, but no tariff. I’m curious if the tariff exempt categories will be affected by this additional 10% tariff. 

Hope this gives everyone a little bit more clarity on this whole trump tariff thing.

[3.02.25, 19:26:03] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys, would love to get ur insight - We duplicated a winning ad with 3x the initial budget and it’s still killing it. I’ve been increasing the budget by 15% every 2-3 days but am considering doing another duplication with 2-3x the budget. Is that a good idea or should we be patient and slowly scale the first duplication?
[3.02.25, 19:28:10] ~ Phil: Everyones different. Some camps can take the double and some can’t. When I was scaling my ASC campaigns I was doubling every 2 days. So I don’t really see the problem. We only used to double when ROAS was 3+ though. Anything below that was 20% bump

[4.02.25, 12:23:16] ~ Mithiran: Does anyone hire a VA to publish ads and scale budgets throughout the day? Is it recommended
[4.02.25, 12:30:23] ~ Robert: to publish yes, scaling is done through automated rules
[4.02.25, 12:33:16] ~ Mithiran: R the rules thru ads manager?
[4.02.25, 12:33:47] ~ Robert: yes
[4.02.25, 12:36:25] ~ Fabian: But the automates rules feuture can’t duplicate adsets/campaign right?
‎[4.02.25, 14:28:40] ~ Arad Khazabi: ‎image omitted
[4.02.25, 14:36:40] ~ Tom: make sure to turn off double opt-in, in klaviyo settings
[4.02.25, 17:45:42] ~ Nils: yo guys! what is the best tool for exporting Facebook / IG comments into a CSV sheet?
[4.02.25, 17:58:46] ~ Arad Khazabi: thanks
[4.02.25, 21:15:06] ~ Mikael: Have anyone experienced that the store profit calc show a certain number of profit. But the bank account do not reflect this profit at all. Liie its a big miss calc. But I cant see what it is
[4.02.25, 21:19:56] ~ Gideon: You forgot inventory stock? Forgot taxes?
[4.02.25, 21:20:25] ~ Bryan T: Are you keeping track of things like transaction fees and chargeback fees?
[4.02.25, 21:50:55] ~ Fabian: I’ve heard some people is paying vat % on the ads sometimes 

Then your adspend is not accurate ‎<This message was edited>
[5.02.25, 3:26:28] ~ Kyle Twohill: anyone have a reliable fb insider contact who can look in an account for flags HIVA score etc
[5.02.25, 4:54:23] ~ Wouter: My Chinese agent just added the trump tax on my products from today anyone noticed the same?
[5.02.25, 5:05:15] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yes bro i just heard it too and it's too much like 5$, customers are definitely not gonna like it and even if you have fat margins it is definitely going to affect.
[5.02.25, 5:05:54] ~ Cody Chaffee: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usps-suspends-packages-china-hong-kong/
[5.02.25, 5:06:00] ~ Cody Chaffee: Y’all seen this?
[5.02.25, 5:06:15] ~ Wouter: Yeah one of my brands is a bag brand
[5.02.25, 5:06:16] ~ Wouter: 30% tax
[5.02.25, 5:06:26] ~ Wouter: But on the cogs so it’s not that high
[5.02.25, 5:07:04] ~ Phil: Trump really doesn’t want chinas business
[5.02.25, 5:07:06] ~ Phil: Crazy
[5.02.25, 5:07:38] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: He brought back tiktok but slapped us the other way basically.
[5.02.25, 5:08:30] ~ Bryan T: Gonna shake things up for sure, hopefully trump sits down with china and negotiates a deal soon or things will get crazy
[5.02.25, 5:10:09] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: My supplier is just mad rn she is saying her bosses haven't slept well from last 3 days 😂
[5.02.25, 6:36:43] ~ Mikael: Yeah I heard this. I double checked all ads and There are no vat or taxes added on the payments what I can see. It says 0% vat.
[5.02.25, 6:37:26] ~ Mikael: Yes, Im doing my best to track these aswell.
[5.02.25, 6:38:12] ~ Mikael: No I think I got it all. Feels more like a backend charge that I cant see. But I dont know.
[5.02.25, 6:39:45] ~ Mason Schulze: transaction fees from shopify
[5.02.25, 6:44:13] ~ Phil: ^^^
[5.02.25, 6:44:36] ~ Phil: I was getting charged 2.9% extra from Shopify for currency conversion fees
[5.02.25, 6:44:38] ~ Phil: Maybe it’s that
[5.02.25, 6:44:46] ~ Phil: Total I get charged 5% from Shopify
[5.02.25, 6:45:35] ~ Mikael: Shit. Yeah this might be. I was counting this awhile back aswell. About 5% total.
[5.02.25, 6:48:43] ~ Mikael: But the stores are in same currency. Sell to same currency and get payout in same currency. Shouldnt be any extra transactionfees on this?
[5.02.25, 6:53:14] ~ Mason Schulze: Will still be 2.9% + 30c on domestic transactions also
[5.02.25, 6:53:34] ~ Wouter: Are you guys adding the trump tax on the products?
[5.02.25, 6:53:49] ~ Mikael: Yes but these are added into the profitcalc program. Like most of our clients use Klarna. etc.
[5.02.25, 6:54:00] ~ Mason Schulze: Just got the message today from my supplier, sending stock to US warehouse asap now
[5.02.25, 6:54:34] ~ Wouter: You still need to pay the %
[5.02.25, 6:54:43] ~ Wouter: it’s also on bulk
[5.02.25, 6:55:11] ~ Mason Schulze: I think he has some way around it
[5.02.25, 7:07:01] ~ Mason Schulze: for the guys in here that are at scale like 1 - 2M per month what is your average ROAS month to month?
[5.02.25, 7:10:28] ~ Aaron Ware: Shit
[5.02.25, 7:10:34] ~ Aaron Ware: Like 1.8 to 2.2
[5.02.25, 9:43:24] Topi: yes
[5.02.25, 9:59:29] ~ harshil Thummar: Yes this is like a meta ads only know how to earn not giving any results
[5.02.25, 10:11:55] ~ Wouter: Did you hear about the 2.74 per shipment extra charge
[5.02.25, 10:12:10] ~ Wouter: So it’s 30% tax + $2.74 per order
[5.02.25, 10:12:14] ~ Ry: Yeah
[5.02.25, 10:13:50] ~ Wouter: How are you all going to deal with that?
[5.02.25, 10:14:50] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Exactly that's my question too.
[5.02.25, 10:15:38] ~ Ben Mansour: It got pretty expensive
[5.02.25, 10:16:07] ~ Ben Mansour: But i guess there will be always a way around
[5.02.25, 10:28:57] ~ Santi Roa: You need proper accounting to really know what's going on with your money
[5.02.25, 10:29:34] ~ Santi Roa: Having a balance sheet and a clean P&L will definitely tell what's going on
[5.02.25, 10:31:56] ~ Mason Schulze: Either way, it's a nightmare calculating everything when you have multiple contractors, subscriptions etc etc, I do it all manually at the end of every month
[5.02.25, 10:32:07] ~ Santi Roa: Make sure you don't overspend until you have 100% clarity over this.

I've seen people over the years get addicted to spending their "profits," and when they found those were not the profits... Or others just buy excess inventory and go bankrupt for lack of cash
[5.02.25, 10:32:34] ~ Mason Schulze: Pen and paper and an Excel  sheet looking through bank transactions
[5.02.25, 10:32:48] ~ Santi Roa: You have to find a person to do it, doing it manually is not scalable at all
[5.02.25, 10:33:06] ~ Santi Roa: At least get QBO and manually categorize transactions
[5.02.25, 10:33:15] ~ Santi Roa: Anyways I'd get a person to do it
[5.02.25, 10:33:18] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh it's another expense having someone do it
[5.02.25, 10:33:32] ~ Mason Schulze: Takes me 2hrs of work once a month and I know it's correct
[5.02.25, 10:33:47] ~ Santi Roa: I tried to start setting it up myself and ended up losing time and money later to have someone to correct it
[5.02.25, 10:36:03] ~ Santi Roa: Of course, what I say is only if you have the money and size to need it. I didn't mean a full time person anyways
[5.02.25, 10:36:28] ~ Mithiran: Is this for all products below 800$?
[5.02.25, 10:36:32] ~ Alvaro De Prada: With google sheets/formulas and automations you can get the day to day profit better than with profit calc.

Then you have your banking accounting which is the real one
[5.02.25, 10:37:11] ~ Alvaro De Prada: For Dtc shipping from China basically
[5.02.25, 10:37:15] ~ Mason Schulze: Did you have someone set up this tracking sheet for you?
[5.02.25, 10:37:35] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Nah. I’m pretty good at this stuff
[5.02.25, 10:37:48] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Just got a guy to create the make automations perfectly
[5.02.25, 10:38:40] ~ Alvaro De Prada: With profit calc you need to make sure you add the COGS per Quantity & Country.

Is the closest to real profit
[5.02.25, 10:39:52] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: So if you ship in bulk it's nothing? Really?
[5.02.25, 10:43:02] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone have a insider connection for Google
[5.02.25, 10:43:27] ~ Santi Roa: When you ship in bulk there are tariffs as well. We always paid 7.5%
[5.02.25, 10:43:43] ~ Santi Roa: Depends on your product  category
[5.02.25, 10:43:58] ~ Alvaro De Prada: When you ship in bulk you pay tariffs on cogs
[5.02.25, 10:44:03] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: All these tariffs end up being paid by final consumer most of the time if there is not a negotiation
[5.02.25, 10:44:05] ~ Santi Roa: I understand now they are raising that 7.5%. Not clear in which category
[5.02.25, 10:44:10] ~ Miika: Go figure out your cash conversion cycle and keep a cash flow sheet where you track everything. Revenue will be pending on processors and a lot of capital gets tied in different places. This is also always worse around the new year and CNY because all the holidays delay payouts while you prestock for the Chinese holidays at the same time
[5.02.25, 10:45:05] ~ Steve: reading American companies may get things a little easier
[5.02.25, 10:45:24] ~ Steve: if you’re US company, importing bulk goods from a place like china, to sell in America, probably business as usual
[5.02.25, 10:46:03] ~ Steve: if you’re a non US company importing chinese goods into US, might be problem - whole goal of trump administration here is to not hurt US companies, and inflict pain on non US or chinese companies
[5.02.25, 10:46:24] ~ Steve: Temu/Shein go fuck yourself is what Trump is saying lol
[5.02.25, 10:47:14] ~ Steve: but in short term there seems to be a ton of confusion - so expect chaos
[5.02.25, 10:48:03] ~ Steve: also if you already make your goods in America - i would 100% be pushing that as hard as possible in your marketing the next 4 years
[5.02.25, 10:48:16] ~ Steve: MADE IN AMERICA gonna be a good selling point for the rest of this decade it seems
[5.02.25, 10:48:46] ~ Steve: we already notice different attitude from customers who find out we ship from china - we’re getting lots of “fuck you its made in china i want my money back”
[5.02.25, 10:48:51] ~ Steve: im sure some of you are experiencing this
[5.02.25, 12:34:04] ~ Wouter: Yes all products
[5.02.25, 13:25:38] ~ Mikael: Yeah I  think that aswell
[5.02.25, 13:26:28] ~ Mikael: true! thank you
[5.02.25, 13:33:28] ~ Mason Schulze: if anyone is interested and is currently facing issues with current suppliers from china, i've been working with the same guy now for 2 years and sent almost 150,000 orders with him and have never had an issue with chargeback % or other problems, can introduce you to him if any one likes, he can fulfill from china or 3PL in US and AUS.
[5.02.25, 13:34:10] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone knows how to deal with copycats
[5.02.25, 13:34:31] ~ Ben Mansour: Many copy our store
[5.02.25, 13:34:35] ~ Ben Mansour: Steal our facebook ads
[5.02.25, 13:34:36] ~ User: DMs
[5.02.25, 13:34:39] ~ Dr Zied: Could you connect?
[5.02.25, 13:34:42] Topi: brand protection agency
[5.02.25, 13:35:02] ~ Ben Mansour: Do you have a contact?
[5.02.25, 13:35:06] Topi: yes
[5.02.25, 13:35:32] ~ Rick: Follow
[5.02.25, 13:48:35] Topi: We also have this, supplier with both China & US 3PLs if anyone needs
[5.02.25, 15:36:42] ~ Mikael: Apparently my supplier solved a 0% tax to US. If anybody needs his contact just pm me
[5.02.25, 15:39:06] ~ RS: Dropshipping from China?
[5.02.25, 15:43:06] ~ Mikael: Yes
[5.02.25, 16:44:37] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. From ur experience can editing a landing page affect running ads that go to that lander?
[5.02.25, 17:28:26] ~ Ben Mansour: A/b test
[5.02.25, 17:28:29] ~ Ben Mansour: Don‘t just change
[5.02.25, 17:29:03] ~ Ben Mansour: But if it‘s a minor change, it‘s ok
[5.02.25, 17:51:18] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ can help
[5.02.25, 18:15:05] ~ Guy Edan: Yeah I changed the desktop layout a bit last night and since then sales from that ad/funnel decreased pretty drastically. Don’t know if it’s actually that but we’ll see
[5.02.25, 18:15:47] ~ Rick: You have more traffic in desktop and not in mobile?
[5.02.25, 18:15:52] ~ Andrea: How much volume are you doing daily 

It's a lot more likely that's just randomness
[5.02.25, 19:27:46] ~ Antonio Celani: Hello guys i buy Stripe accounts and Shopify Payments account FARMED

If you have something to sell please write me DM.

I will buy it through bank transfer or crypto if we find a good deal
[5.02.25, 19:29:15] ~ Filippo: anyone here buying in bulk from China? cogs increased there too?
[5.02.25, 19:32:50] ~ Christopher Murphy: Anyone running applovin traffic?
[5.02.25, 19:39:26] ~ Steve: Yep
[5.02.25, 19:40:22] ~ Christopher Murphy: Are you running it to a funnelish page? We are having issues setting up the Axon pixel with funnelish
[5.02.25, 19:41:45] ~ Steve: Nope just running to Shopify

[5.02.25, 20:03:16] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: That’s definitely the most accurate information being sent out by a fulfillment company right now.
[5.02.25, 20:04:16] ~ RS: Not a fan of Trump anymore 😀
[5.02.25, 20:05:14] ~ Steve: It's huge opportunity. Those have the skills and who can adapt will majorly win, vs those who can't. Problems are always opportunity
‎[5.02.25, 20:05:47] ~ Ben Mansour: ‎image omitted
[5.02.25, 20:21:41] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: I know a lot of people are nervous about the tariffs and how the removal of de minimis rule will affect supply chain. I posted on X to provide some clarification in case it’s helpful to you or others you know: https://x.com/glepkoff127/status/1887170991291564137?s=48&t=dIcCk85uTvVXJZ0UzFLdXQ
[5.02.25, 20:28:47] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: I’ll update more as information becomes available.
[5.02.25, 20:38:21] ~ Filippo: Thank you for the post, I have a question: I didn’t understand if costs increase for importing in bulk or the fees you talk about were already active  in the past
[5.02.25, 20:44:39] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: So it depends on the shipment method you’re doing in bulk. Like if you’re doing DDP shipping with a freight company, they are just giving you a tracking number to UPS or Fedex. That form of pricing is duties + taxes and you’re charged on a per KG basis. 

If you’re importing in bulk the more legitimate way where you’re working with a customs broker to handle your customs clearance, you will be paying the Duties (based on HTS code) + tariff that the HTS code falls under (tariff exempt, 7.5%, 15% or 25%) + the 10% additional tariff. Then there are two small percentage fees .125% (harbor maintenance) and .3464% (merchandise processing). These percentages are based on the value of your goods.
[5.02.25, 20:45:41] ~ Filippo: It gets deep. But are these tariffs on bulk orders new ?
[5.02.25, 20:49:05] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: The only part that is new is the 10% that was announced and the removal of the $800 de minimus rule. The others percentages were always there. With de minimus being removed, now any kind of bulk shipment that gets valued under $800 will have these duties and tariffs in place. You just need to make sure you know the HTS codes of your product and you’re selecting the right one. 

Your supplier in China will have an HS code, but you’ll need to make sure on your side that the correct HTS code is being used. Sometimes there are products that can fall under 2 different HTS codes and its up to you which one you want to use. Of course its always better to use the HTS code that has lower duty amount (assuming you have the option to choose between two HTS codes).
[5.02.25, 21:39:43] ~ Ben Mansour: People who advertise in uk
[5.02.25, 21:39:58] ~ Ben Mansour: Is it better to target only england rather than uk?
[5.02.25, 22:07:33] ~ Nal: We always left it on UK
[5.02.25, 22:37:52] ~ Ben Mansour: When you break down by country
[5.02.25, 22:38:00] ~ Ben Mansour: Is roas good in wales and scotland?
[5.02.25, 22:52:40] ~ Nal: Scotland was good, above 2. wales was average just above BE ‎<This message was edited>
[5.02.25, 23:21:55] ~ Ben Mansour: ok thanks
[6.02.25, 0:47:50] ~ Wouter: I’ve heard people that stop selling into the USA for now as everything will be returned to sender
[6.02.25, 0:47:52] ~ Wouter: Is that right?
[6.02.25, 1:03:53] ~ Kyle Twohill: anyone have good post purchase upsell templates they wouldn't mind sharing?
[6.02.25, 1:05:23] ~ Andrea: more of the same -> more of the same downsell -> secondary product that enhances the function of the main product -> downsell of that -> third product if you have one -> downsell of that 

however depends on the kind of product
[6.02.25, 1:05:46] ~ Andrea: Or I'm not sure if you meant actual pages designs
[6.02.25, 1:06:39] ~ Kyle Twohill: page designs but I appreciate your response though and ill test that setup
[6.02.25, 1:07:37] ~ Andrea: ah ok got you. if you have a VSL a lot of people just let the VSL do the explanation and have the offer below it and a footer, nothing else
[6.02.25, 1:07:54] ~ Kyle Twohill: got it thank you

[6.02.25, 5:55:09] ~ Cody Chaffee: I paused USA advertising for the time being. Waiting to see how customs acts. I’m not worried about tariffs, I am worried about the delays in customs processing
[6.02.25, 8:27:39] ~ Austin: I’ll be in Dubai for mastermind event from February 25th-3rd of march id like to get a group of 2-3 more to share a place for a few days before the event and drop some crazy value on each other before hand ….hit my line if interested

[6.02.25, 17:43:34] ~ Ben Mansour: So the visitor will automatically see his. Local currency and country at checkout
[6.02.25, 18:21:04] ~ Alex: did you try with incognito window so no cookies?
[6.02.25, 18:28:34] ~ Mithiran: I use hextom currency converter, but its not that good because there's a delay that customers can see from usd price to aud price
[6.02.25, 18:38:39] ~ Nal: If you still saw USA in checkout when you initially went on the site then either the vpn didn’t work or u need to try it on an incognito tab ‎<This message was edited>
[6.02.25, 18:39:31] ~ Nal: And are you using Shopify payments?
[6.02.25, 19:20:15] ~ Ben Mansour: yes

You will also receive warnings about affected campaigns in the Ads Manager Campaigns table and when you create or edit campaigns. »

I have 40k£ with airwallex stuck as I said before and they told me to send them a HK bank account under same company to take the transfer through emails and my account will be permanently closed.

I opened currenxie and spoke to support, they said i can't transfer money from same company other bank,
I asked Payoneer and opened a Payoneer, they said the same. What do I do now? 

Well I also use a PAYONEER USA and I usually top-up from my wise and it works fluently so y'all think i can just not ask them and get airwallex wiring my 40k£?

[6.02.25, 22:20:40] ~ Rick: Bestfullfill
[6.02.25, 22:58:55] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Hey guys, I’ve been talking to a lot of brands and it seems like there is quite a bit of confusion about how tariffs and duties work. I wrote up a fairly detailed summary in case it might be helpful. (https://x.com/glepkoff127/status/1887579853504856073?s=46&t=bGtGAzIx7XFXTWJCdGkAeg). Please also let me know if you have additional insights - I just want to share info to help people out.
[6.02.25, 23:09:19] ~ Filippo: So basically the final cost is around 50% more per unit (including handling & custom clearance fee)? ‎<This message was edited>
[6.02.25, 23:26:05] ~ Cody Chaffee: One of my suppliers said there was a 30 day delay on shipments to the US, can anyone confirm?
[6.02.25, 23:26:39] ~ Filippo: my supplier has fucked up
[6.02.25, 23:26:49] ~ Filippo: i have orders from early Jan that havent been delivered yet ‎<This message was edited>
[6.02.25, 23:30:53] ~ Aaron Ware: Anyone have an actual reliable insider to unban ad account?
[6.02.25, 23:31:55] ~ Cody Chaffee: yea i got you, dm
[6.02.25, 23:58:53] ~ Charles: Same
[7.02.25, 0:26:03] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: it really depends on your product category which is why knowing your HTS code is so important. Like if you’re selling a pillow for example, the duty on that is a 5.3% duty + 7.5% tariff + additional 10%. so based on product cogs before shipping, the duties and taxes come out 22.8%
[7.02.25, 0:58:53] ~ Ishroop: Anybody know an app that can translate landing pages to a different language?
[7.02.25, 1:21:14] ~ Nebil: How are you guys structuring payment deals for influencer whitelisting on meta and IG?

[7.02.25, 3:35:20] ~ Steph: We do. Drop me a DM
[7.02.25, 6:31:42] ~ Gordon: hey guys - has anyone had issues with HK shopify payments card acceptance rates? would it normally be higher if we registered shopify payments under US / AU instead?

thanks
[7.02.25, 6:55:04] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: US llc will be higher obviously but it’s still pretty good for HK
[7.02.25, 6:57:02] ~ Gordon: Ah ok thanks , so the difference between registering Shopify payments under HK v US would be pretty marginal?
[7.02.25, 6:57:43] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: Imo yes
[7.02.25, 7:05:22] ~ Gordon: Got it cheers @⁨~Jonathan Bech Mayer⁩
[7.02.25, 9:25:47] ~ Daniel: hey guys, does anyone know if hiding the reviews tab on your page affects performance?
[7.02.25, 9:46:26] ~ Ben Mansour: 80% of buyers don‘t scroll past the buy box
[7.02.25, 9:46:43] ~ Ben Mansour: But some also scroll down all the way ro reviews
[7.02.25, 9:46:58] ~ Ben Mansour: Maybe some drop in cvr
[7.02.25, 9:51:10] ~ Daniel: no I mean on fb page
[7.02.25, 9:51:46] ~ Daniel: if fb penalizes you for doing that
[7.02.25, 9:52:58] ~ Mason Schulze: Nah it doesn't
[7.02.25, 9:53:06] ~ Mason Schulze: Did this ages ago no difference
[7.02.25, 9:53:18] ~ Daniel: ok makes sense, thanks man!
[7.02.25, 16:23:04] ~ Malik: Hi guys, anyone knows a service that can get you Swish, the local payment method in Sweden ?
[7.02.25, 16:51:28] ~ George: Hey everyone, does anyone know where I can get real professional practitioners to review/partner up on my health products? For example, similar to Kenkoback partnering with chiropractors and using reviews from them? How would you go about doing something similar for a brand with hundreds of real positive reviews
[7.02.25, 16:53:23] ~ Bazeed: Email every chiropractor/ health practitioner you can find online locally or thorougout the us. Pretty easy to find their emails/ phone numbers.
[7.02.25, 17:16:43] ~ Samy: You need a Swedish bank to get the swish agreement, then you can sell with for instance QuickPay.
[7.02.25, 17:28:20] ~ Mithiran: i used backstage and found a lot of doctors on there
[7.02.25, 19:50:33] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. We want to see where our offer stands and if we can improve it. Can you share what % of ur customers buy 2+ units in the initial offer?
[7.02.25, 19:58:07] ~ Andrea: Depends on a lot of stuff
[7.02.25, 19:58:26] ~ Andrea: Mostly the perceived value
[7.02.25, 20:09:22] ~ Ben Mansour: Add a small note above the bundles on why they should buy 2 or more
[7.02.25, 20:28:40] ~ Tom: Hey guys, anyone can recommend a good designer for product pictures?
[7.02.25, 20:31:20] ~ Bryan T: https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-signs-order-delaying-tariffs-de-minimis-imports-china-2025-02-07/ well that was fast

[7.02.25, 20:32:23] ~ Ben Mansour: Just the de minumis?
[7.02.25, 20:32:30] ~ Ben Mansour: What about the 30% ?
[7.02.25, 20:33:51] ~ Bryan T: Doesn't mention it in the article, says US customs is overwhelmed with packages right now so that's why it's delayed
[7.02.25, 20:35:37] ~ Ben Mansour: That‘s good
[7.02.25, 20:35:59] ~ Ben Mansour: Tbh it was a good push
[7.02.25, 20:36:00] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone know if there’s a way to do “free gifts” on funnelish?
[7.02.25, 20:36:26] ~ Ben Mansour: Now people should be thinking about new markets oe even locally made products or products sourced from elsewhere
[7.02.25, 20:38:05] ~ Bryan T: for sure, entire thing is a great wake up call on just how fast market conditions can change/why you need to have a backup plan at all times
[7.02.25, 20:42:16] ~ Nils: yo! anyone in here that is tracking hidden comments % on their fb ads?

[7.02.25, 21:37:55] ~ Mike Ramsey: Ah - just saw that.  You were quick 😂

There was no way the de minimis removal was going to be implemented that quickly.  I thought it would maybe be a few more days, but that was cancelled quickly lol
[8.02.25, 0:59:47] ~ Austin: I’m creating a digital product as a upsells in the survival niche and found a local instructor, called him, explained the reason for doing it and what the end product would look like, he actually loved it and we recorded 1/2 of it 3 days ago and will finish this Tuesday…awesome guy and footage. 

If wanting to do so just have chat got make a basic brief with X amount  of modules 
and 2-5 talking points per module 

I’ll also be using many golden clips as ads that I could position my product as the solution

Then I plan to have a paid FB group as a upsell in the corse and post purchase upsell #2-3 for reoccurring revenue 

But once having a face to face connection and clear understanding of how you both benefit I find it’s bery easy to try professionals on your side

[8.02.25, 5:04:16] ~ Wouter: Do you know good software to get UGC’s. I’m currently using billo and influee but pretty expensive
[8.02.25, 5:08:08] ~ Austin: I user Arcads.AI for AI actors and from what I can see the audience knows no difference...Have an actor talking on top of screen and prodcut footage on bottom or have it go in and out of B-roll....asked my partner to look at it before saying it was AI and they didn't know the difference.....$500 a month for 50 videos.....i can typically make 2 30 second scripts out of each video as its capped at something like 1500 character....there's plans for cheaper....would highly suggest...lots or demographics and accents.
[8.02.25, 5:09:11] ~ Austin: Use Klaude.ai for scripts, light years ahead of GPT for copy

[8.02.25, 20:08:56] ~ Ben Mansour: Afterpay works well also
[8.02.25, 20:33:36] ~ Matt: Has anyone noticed a reduction in conversions by using a custom checkout and 3rd party payment processor which means customers cant use shop pay anymore?
[8.02.25, 21:09:01] ~ Austin: Planning a 2-3 night Airbnb meet up before the Dubai Mastermind, DM if interested, space is limited.
[8.02.25, 23:30:12] ~ Jonny: Slight drop at first but it recovered within a few days
[9.02.25, 1:38:17] ~ Gideon: We got 2 chargebacks (cc) from 2 people who are trying to scam us. Total 600. Is there a way to fix this?
[9.02.25, 1:44:53] ~ Christopher Murphy: Does anyone have any good PDP templates they can share with me for funnelish?
[9.02.25, 1:45:23] ~ Gideon: No dropshipping by the way. Next day delivery
[9.02.25, 1:45:29] ~ Christopher Murphy: Might be down. Could you dm me the details?
[9.02.25, 2:32:53] Amit Wadhawan: Nice work @⁨~Austin⁩!
[9.02.25, 3:00:52] ~ Austin: For SMS I use one text, one awesome feature we see great results with is “live chat” where the customer can text live with service reps about anything they may have concerns about. We find SMS FAR outperforms email.
[9.02.25, 3:39:52] ~ Austin: Here’s how I got an A player editor….go to online jobs.ph, make a job post specifying you need a HIGHLY SKILLED editor that can edit HIGLY ENGAGING FB ad edits. 

In the description have a hidden word they have to start their application message with so you know they read it. Contact 6 of the best on paper

Write a DETAILED SOP with google links to all the branded content you have and give them access 

provide a detailed brief of what you need for every second of the script. Provide an example of a winning ad so they have something to aim for. 

Tell them you expect the same quality or higher, keep revising and revising and revising until it’s up to spec. Many will fall off by the revision count alone by the end you’ll probably have 3 that completed with 1 being the obvious A+ player, bring him on and let him know he’s got a week until content has to pass by 2 revisions. 

Many won’t take pace….it took me 13 failed hires (and maybe more) before getting an A+ player but this man edits multiples higher than I could and I’ve edited over 1,000 creatives personally. 

I play $30 per edit with 3 hooks and then $50 bonus for ROAS 2x and $75 for ROAS 3X so he stays on the quality.
[9.02.25, 4:36:41] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone have some good examples of bundle offers on PDP
[9.02.25, 5:26:40] ~ Austin: Javy coffee does a good job
[9.02.25, 5:27:18] ~ Austin: With stacking incentives to push the higher purchase as well such as recipe books and things of that sort
[9.02.25, 7:40:18] ~ Mason Schulze: anyone here using FREE GIFT with purchase in their offers? ‎<This message was edited>
[9.02.25, 7:48:55] ~ Cody Chaffee: yessir
[9.02.25, 7:50:12] ~ Mason Schulze: Working well?
[9.02.25, 7:52:04] ~ Cody Chaffee: really well. doing free digital prod + free physical prod
[9.02.25, 7:53:32] ~ Gord JB: Ye - we use rebuy app for it 

Works well

& same for if they hit a certain value (>$230) they get more free gifts (that cost us $4 to make)
‎[9.02.25, 7:53:57] ~ Gord JB: ‎image omitted
[9.02.25, 8:03:05] ~ Mason Schulze: How are you guys displaying it, just as FREE GIFT because I was thinking that sounds a bit overplayed and unprofessional, was trying to find another way to display it that looks more valuable.
[9.02.25, 8:06:03] ~ Cody Chaffee: you could display it like “FREE (product name), 40$ value” or smth like that
[9.02.25, 8:10:32] ~ Gord JB: Yep this
[9.02.25, 8:10:47] ~ Gord JB: Everyone likes FREE items
[9.02.25, 8:11:26] ~ Gord JB: There’s intel that AG1’s best performing ads are the ones that show how many FREE items & value you are getting with their subscription
[9.02.25, 8:18:07] ~ Mason Schulze: Do you guys keep the gift as a mystery or have it automatically add in at checkout?
[9.02.25, 8:18:25] ~ Gord JB: Auto
[9.02.25, 12:45:33] ~ Arad Khazabi: You’re the 🐐 thanks!🫡
[9.02.25, 14:21:43] ~ Gideon: Anybody has advice for succes to fix it. It are our only 2 chargebacks in 5 years so besides this no experience how you have the highest success rate. And which evidence is inportant
[9.02.25, 14:24:06] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Just provide all proof you have and hope for the best:

Customer communication
Delivery information
Invoice of order
Signature on delivery if available
[9.02.25, 14:24:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Send a sicario to their home also
[9.02.25, 14:26:04] ~ Ben Mansour: Bro you should give us advice hahah
[9.02.25, 14:26:16] ~ Gideon: Thanks. Haha. Just googled sicario 🤣
[9.02.25, 14:27:36] ~ Gideon: Haha. I think next day delivery helps. But you need stock for this which isnt that good for cash flow. But were happy with it
[9.02.25, 14:32:22] ~ Mithiran: Has anyone here created modules for a course? Any tips or structure to follow to make people actually find it useful?
[9.02.25, 15:02:49] ~ Brice: I usually map them out in a doc and get really clear on what you want the takeaways to be for the whole course & each module so you can work your backwards to getting there. Then do short videos for specific topics vs. long videos that cover multiple. That seems to help people get through it better
[9.02.25, 15:03:28] ~ Brice: and people have different learning styles so we get the videos done and then have a VA create a workbook to go along with it for people who prefer to read + follow along
[9.02.25, 15:03:54] ~ Brice: easy to make and increases the perceived value quite a bit when you have the extra things to go along with it
[9.02.25, 15:11:56] ~ Mithiran: do you lock the modules or let them watch everything all at once?
[9.02.25, 15:22:09] ~ Brice: unlock everything let them go through it all at once. Almost no one will go through the whole thing but lots of people will go in and go to a specific thing they wanted to see
[9.02.25, 15:50:43] ~ Mithiran: Thanks man and what platform do you use to host it?
[9.02.25, 16:15:42] ~ Brice: Kajabi
[9.02.25, 16:18:27] ~ Davide: anyone run VSLs in skincare?
[9.02.25, 18:29:43] ~ Austin: Has anyone made an AI that manages customer service messages? Email, DM, Comments, ect? This customer service cost is ridiculous even with my philo guy at $4 an hour.  More efficient systems / AI creation would be awesome. Please DM.
[9.02.25, 20:08:34] ~ Cody Chaffee: anyone know how customers know I am using shopify? I’m getting a ton of complaints sent to Shopify support. I don’t have Shopify in my footer or anywhere on my site, so I have no idea how they’re figuring it out
[9.02.25, 20:09:00] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Having the same issue is driving me nuts
[9.02.25, 20:09:16] ~ Alvaro De Prada: They don’t even contact support, straight to Shopify 🥲
[9.02.25, 20:21:59] ~ Ben Mansour: I got it once, I think people are more aware and used to shopify stores and checkout layout nowadays
[9.02.25, 20:31:00] ~ A: Are they using shop pay?
[9.02.25, 20:54:23] ~ Zsombor: How do you detect this?
[9.02.25, 20:54:29] ~ Zsombor: Shopify sends you an email?
[9.02.25, 21:02:11] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah,

[9.02.25, 22:25:12] ~ Ben Mansour: Bestfulfill
[9.02.25, 22:25:40] ~ Ben Mansour: If you are a high spender, they give you unlimited spend ad account and business manager
[9.02.25, 22:35:28] ~ Davide: Profit calc
[9.02.25, 22:47:14] ~ M A N U E L: Guys how long you wait before taking a decision on an A/B test with intelligems?
[9.02.25, 22:49:18] ~ Ben Mansour: It depends, people usually say 400 orders
[9.02.25, 22:50:12] ~ Ben Mansour: But for us if the results are very close and groups are taking over each other day by day we wait
[9.02.25, 22:50:33] ~ Ben Mansour: But if one group is better every day consistently even with small %
[9.02.25, 22:50:36] ~ Ben Mansour: It‘s the winner
[9.02.25, 23:31:50] ~ M A N U E L: got u bro thx

[10.02.25, 0:42:02] ~ Zsombor: I see and is this even a problem if Shopify doesn't do anything? Seems better than a chargeback to me.
[10.02.25, 0:45:40] ~ Christian: Hey guys, for new product testing, when do you know something is definitely wrong with the ads or the product when testing with broad? Is there a certain rule one can follow before stopping the ads?
[10.02.25, 2:28:48] ~ Austin: ‎This message was deleted.
[10.02.25, 2:28:59] ~ Austin: Personally my products rarely does better on broad than with interest suggestions, I believe it’s because it’s very niche and FB needs some guidance. I test ads with 9 of my best performing interests + broad for that past 3 days + today on a $50 adset budget and my overall creative hit rate is about 40% with brand new angles / formats.
[10.02.25, 2:30:41] ~ Austin: Profit calc is like $400 a month and kept disconnecting from the store / FB. Does anyone have better options?
[10.02.25, 2:32:17] ~ Mason Schulze: truprofit works well

[10.02.25, 2:57:11] ~ Gord JB: We found a Gorgias plugin from a competitor that is like 75% of the price of Gorgias AI
[10.02.25, 2:57:17] ~ Aaron Ware: Yeah I’m spending $2k / month on it but it’s life changing.
[10.02.25, 2:57:33] ~ Aaron Ware: lol I was waiting for some Indian developer to rip it

[10.02.25, 2:57:42] ~ Gord JB: Aussie **

Haha
[10.02.25, 2:58:16] ~ Gord JB: End of the day it’s just a chat gpt plugin - shocking they charge brands that much for the AI use

Right?
[10.02.25, 2:59:01] ~ Aaron Ware: Man I would say it’s 100x better than that it’s crazy how you can train it. And then it trains its self.

[10.02.25, 13:12:16] ~ Samy: Guys whats your experience with turning on ads that has been of for 3 weeks, do they usually perform the same after 1-2 Days or performance just completley dipps? ( they were turned of because we ran out of inventory). When I searched online some people said that it doesnt really matter and others said that a lot of the optimization is gone after 2 weeks.
[10.02.25, 13:41:10] ~ Timotej: We always bring back our successful campaigns, typically after a 2-3 month break. The results are mixed - sometimes these relaunches perform well, while other times they're less successful and we pause them after a few days.
[10.02.25, 13:44:24] ~ Samy: Alright, thanks!
[10.02.25, 14:32:26] ~ Omar Tayara: Anyone here has a UK company? Need some advice

[10.02.25, 16:46:48] ~ Jonny: Yeah we’ve used it in the past but it only works for US customers
[10.02.25, 16:47:19] ~ Rick: yes
[10.02.25, 17:17:40] ~ Al: nah as much as they want to say it is, it isn't and it's also more expensive
[10.02.25, 17:17:54] ~ Al: it has other functions sure but as a post purchase upsell app it's basically the same with an extra step if you want
[10.02.25, 17:19:15] ~ Rick: what is your cr% on the first post purchase?
[10.02.25, 18:35:45] ~ Mithiran: @⁨~Brice⁩ how many modules do you normally have in a course? Thanks

[10.02.25, 19:29:41] ~ Daniel: hey guys, does anyone know if split testing themes (diff carts) messes up with the pixel or something?
[10.02.25, 19:30:17] ~ Alexander Sundström: We have been stuck between 100-200k for the last year. We run traffic to pdp in Shopify in Northern Europe. We have finally got a video editor/graphics person. We run ads on meta/ig/tiktok/bing/google. Atc to purchase ratio is 1/3 almost 1/4 and aov 130 usd. It is all working, but we want to be able to scale, and the work we put in keeps us at the same level, but everytime we scale up we eventually scale down because results drop. We are going to move to bigger markets here soon. What should be our focus other than that?
[10.02.25, 19:37:10] ~ Andrea: I suggest getting a mentor that helps you guys directly

[10.02.25, 21:37:18] ~ Ben Mansour: Do it yourself with ai
[10.02.25, 21:37:43] ~ Ben Mansour: For funnels you usually need a designer and liquid developer
[10.02.25, 21:39:39] ~ Omar Tayara: I am still pushing traffic to my product page. Which ai software do you use?
[10.02.25, 21:40:38] ~ Brice: as long it needs to be to deliver. For short mini courses like 2 - 3 hours and goes up from there
[10.02.25, 22:04:15] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you guys keep shipping protection pre selected in cart or no not worth it due to compliance issues/CR
[10.02.25, 22:29:31] ~ Ben Mansour: chatgpt for copy and section ideas
[10.02.25, 22:29:48] ~ Ben Mansour: tell it about your product and ask it for cutsomer avatars and mass market desires
[10.02.25, 22:30:07] ~ Ben Mansour: and then tell it to make you sections for a shopify product page
[10.02.25, 22:30:24] ~ Ben Mansour: with headline, text and image idea for each section

[11.02.25, 20:33:28] ~ Christian: hey guys, which tools can I use to see TikTok video ads and filter them by views/likes or such?
[11.02.25, 20:33:42] ~ Tom: Pipiads
[11.02.25, 20:35:50] ~ Ben Mansour: Have anyone noticed inconsistency in facebook ads in january?
[11.02.25, 20:37:10] ~ Ry: Last 2 days yes
[11.02.25, 20:39:56] ~ Lovro Knavs: Yep last few days
[11.02.25, 20:50:48] ~ Kyle Twohill: for me last few days
[11.02.25, 20:51:17] ~ michael: Not really
[11.02.25, 20:52:09] ~ Christopher Murphy: Last few days have been bad for us as well - bid caps and cost caps are barely spending
[11.02.25, 21:07:32] ~ Guy Edan: Does anyone know of a way to A/B test pricing in funnelish? Because with their integrated page A/B testing, the product list applies to the whole funnel
[11.02.25, 21:10:14] ~ Andrea: You need to duplicate the checkout and everything after
[11.02.25, 21:13:40] ~ Guy Edan: And then you do A/B test on the lander that each button takes you to a different checkout?
[11.02.25, 21:16:27] ~ Andrea: Yes
[11.02.25, 21:21:47] ~ Guy Edan: Good idea. Thanks
[11.02.25, 21:22:08] ~ Andrea: No prob
[11.02.25, 22:20:31] ~ Christian: Thanks you
[12.02.25, 0:10:58] ~ Gideon: Guys, Do you put on all the fb optimizations for the ads, or do you turn specific optimizations off?
[12.02.25, 0:17:24] ~ Guy Edan: Do you guys find an actual difference in performance when in learning vs not in learning?
[12.02.25, 1:39:56] ~ Ben Mansour: All off
[12.02.25, 2:41:31] ~ Mithiran: all off except for relevant comments
[12.02.25, 3:22:36] ~ Mason Schulze: hey guys, any one have a good contact inside of Taboola?
[12.02.25, 3:46:30] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Any ideas where to get images that look natural of customers holding the product? we send emails to customers and offer 50% off on next order if they post a review with a pic but that doesn’t bring much for us unfortunately
[12.02.25, 3:47:37] ~ Mason Schulze: Send them a free product instead and you will have better luck ‎<This message was edited>
[12.02.25, 3:47:45] ~ Zvi: i had goos success with sora
[12.02.25, 3:58:28] ~ Christopher Murphy: What’s your prompt? I haven’t been impressed with Sora much lately
[12.02.25, 4:02:30] ~ Zvi: upload a picture of the product and then ask for what i want and keep adding to the request until i get something very close to what i wanted its important to say that my products can easy be sold using ai content
[12.02.25, 6:06:50] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: Exactly the same
[12.02.25, 6:12:39] ~ Ry: Gonna wait it out?
[12.02.25, 6:14:58] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: Yeah we'll just push through it
[12.02.25, 6:15:13] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: After rain comes the sunshine 🚀
[12.02.25, 6:20:17] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys I’m split testing landing pages with VWO. My original page used to convert at 3.7%, but since i launched new test (with no changes), it dropped to 2.4%. A new page is at 2.6%, which is better than 2.4% but not the original 3.7%. 

Has anyone else seen this happen? Should I compare my test page to the old 3.7% or the current 2.4%?
[12.02.25, 6:51:00] ~ Wouter: When entering new European markets do you use an app to translate everything in German and French or do it manually
[12.02.25, 7:40:38] ~ Brian: Meta is sending you lower quality traffic because of your creative. Compare it to the current 2.4%. How many sessions has the test had?
[12.02.25, 9:02:01] ~ Errol: I want to take a shirt design and put it on a model posing with a lifestyle background that is generated by AI. Does anyone know of any services that can do this?
[12.02.25, 9:02:14] ~ Errol: Its for a new clothing brand
[12.02.25, 9:05:46] ~ Mithiran: wdym meta is sending lower quality traffic, why does that happen?
[12.02.25, 10:36:07] ~ Alex: Hi Dark Lords! does anyone have an insider or personal contact at stripe? money has been stuck for a long time and I don't get any response from stripe support
[12.02.25, 10:37:44] ~ Daniel: hey I got it out using Alex’s lawyer https://www.capuanostudiolegale.it/ if you don’t find an insider then he can get the money out
[12.02.25, 10:39:58] ~ Alex: Thank you! 🙏
[12.02.25, 11:06:02] ~ Steph: I'll connect you with someone @⁨~Alex⁩
[12.02.25, 11:09:17] ~ Alex: Thanks
[12.02.25, 11:46:10] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone in here selling to spain
[12.02.25, 12:40:54] ~ Alexander Sundström: does anybody have a vsl for a gadget in a swipe file?
[12.02.25, 13:12:07] ~ Dorian: ok thank you for your feedback!
[12.02.25, 15:43:10] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone can recommend a good supplement factory in usa? With good prices
[12.02.25, 16:32:18] ~ Jonny: Usually 180 day hold from the day you received the hold. Should be a date on the payouts section showing when it will be released. Stripe always release funds, unless you are past the 180 day hold of course
[12.02.25, 16:32:29] ~ Jonny: Also looking for software that can do this
[12.02.25, 17:01:31] ~ Filippo: hey guys, can Stripe change the balance overnight?
[12.02.25, 21:20:55] ~ Austin: What's a good alternative for AB/ testing pages / offers on shopify other than intellegems ?
[12.02.25, 21:37:10] ~ Kyle Twohill: a/b convert is pretty good for most things
[12.02.25, 21:40:53] ~ Gideon: Does it have negative side effects for loading speed or seo or other things?
[12.02.25, 21:41:57] ~ Kyle Twohill: From my experience no I would ask their support though if you want to be 100% safe
[12.02.25, 21:42:16] ~ Kyle Twohill: I would use it for small tweaks etc
[12.02.25, 21:44:24] ~ Gideon: Okay nice. What kind off tests would you start with?
[12.02.25, 21:46:37] ~ Kyle Twohill: ill dm
[12.02.25, 21:52:11] ~ Gideon: Thanks!
[12.02.25, 21:59:04] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: What’s the goal of these questionnaires? To warm up the lead?
[12.02.25, 21:59:38] ~ Filippo: Does anyone know the repeat customer % for Spartan ?
[12.02.25, 22:01:52] ~ Rick: i have more than 13% on shopify
[12.02.25, 22:23:59] ~ Rick: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ Rick
[12.02.25, 22:24:46] ~ Rick: 👀
[12.02.25, 22:28:20] ~ Rick: Hey all, nice to meet and thanks for the invite @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩
[13.02.25, 2:44:14] ~ George: Shoplift is solid. Pagedeck is too, it’s basically intelligems & replo combined
[13.02.25, 3:36:38] ~ Phil: anyone in here been completely kicked off shopify payments?
[13.02.25, 3:36:59] ~ Phil: like every time you open a store they wont support you with their payments
[13.02.25, 3:37:37] ~ Aaron Ware: Can’t you open it under HK company?
[13.02.25, 3:37:50] ~ Aaron Ware: Get paid out through airwallex
[13.02.25, 3:44:22] ~ Phil: yeah i have that set up was just wondering if im fully blocked for life or if its only for a small period
[13.02.25, 3:46:10] ~ Aaron Ware: If the stores registered in HK name how are you blocked?
[13.02.25, 3:47:34] ~ Phil: I havnt started running my HK company on anything yet
[13.02.25, 3:47:45] ~ Phil: ive had a 100% hold from november
[13.02.25, 3:47:51] ~ Phil: so i created another 2 new stores
[13.02.25, 3:48:33] ~ Phil: and its said that my merchant account has been blocked so both payments from those stores have been terminated (ones brand new no sales and the other was an old store i opened back up with 500 orders and no chargebacks. Was running fine back then but once opened up again got blocked straight away) ‎<This message was edited>
[13.02.25, 3:48:48] ~ Phil: and the store that has the 100% hold the money gets released next month
[13.02.25, 3:51:42] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: For fashion general stores, it might be that customers report it/ do complaint directly to shopify. 

I’ve done it several time, moving from one payment processor to another but as in the fundamentals customers mostly not satisfied, it will keep happening at the end

Too much problem regarding size, style, material etc for fashion items. I myself move on to non fashion branding now. Never got issue with payment processor again (done 5-6k orders) as customers are in general happier.
[13.02.25, 3:52:23] ~ Phil: yeah was in general fashion
[13.02.25, 3:52:55] ~ Phil: but i think with the HK company and proper structured backend I can avoid it from happening again
[13.02.25, 3:53:07] ~ Phil: was just curious to know if I can ever use shopify payments again or not
[13.02.25, 3:53:49] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: nah bro, i've tried hk structures too. at best, you'll get 10-30% reserve with shopify payment.
[13.02.25, 3:54:22] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: only survive up to 1-2 months best
[13.02.25, 3:54:54] ~ Phil: so even with HK structure you have got 100% holds and been kicked off air wallex?
[13.02.25, 3:55:14] ~ Aaron Ware: Yeah having a 15% reserve is better than no payments if you’re personally banned
[13.02.25, 3:55:40] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: airwallex hk will do 15-35% hold eventually for fashion
[13.02.25, 3:56:36] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: but if we operate on 20-35% gross margin, having even 15% reserve and delayed 3-5 days payout, its still hard to build cashflow positive business ‎<This message was edited>
[13.02.25, 3:58:56] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: It's easy to scale to 30-40k$/day in fashion niche, but too many headache at the end ‎<This message was edited>
[13.02.25, 3:59:04] ~ Aaron Ware: Man 20-35 gross is not good business. Should be 20-35 net margins.
[13.02.25, 4:00:45] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: what i mean by gross is after ad spend, cogs and  processor fee. net is after paying all employees, tools, tax, etc ‎<This message was edited>
[13.02.25, 4:02:35] ~ Aaron Ware: Correct. You should aim for a business making 20-35% net margins.
[13.02.25, 4:03:10] ~ Aaron Ware: Things like this don’t hurt as bad then.
[13.02.25, 4:10:08] ~ Phil: but the hold normally last 60-90 days then goes away right or do you always have it
[13.02.25, 4:16:31] ~ Phil: for airwallex ^
[13.02.25, 6:29:40] ~ Jay More Than Scaling: ‎Reagan added ~ Jay More Than Scaling
[13.02.25, 10:37:01] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey everyone what have you found the most effective way to take down people ripping your ads on Facebook
[13.02.25, 10:48:35] ~ Steve: Make better ads
[13.02.25, 10:48:42] ~ Steve: Just keep being creative and winning
[13.02.25, 10:49:08] ~ Steve: You can of course use agencies or tools to get people taken down
[13.02.25, 10:49:23] ~ Steve: But honestly unless you are 100% sure you know who they are, I wouldn't
[13.02.25, 10:49:29] ~ Aaron Ware: Are they running them to a cloned Shopify store using your stolen content?
[13.02.25, 10:49:47] ~ Steve: You never know who is ripping your ads and maybe they know the game better than you do or are bigger than you and then start fucking with you
[13.02.25, 10:50:18] ~ Steve: We had the same thing happen when we kicked off this brand. Straight Rips with our footage, hooks and even my voice as I do the voice overs
[13.02.25, 10:50:54] ~ Steve: But I knew they were a lot larger than us at the time and probably had resources to fuck with us if I fucked with them.

Instead I put that energy to just beating them on creatives. And more and more and more
[13.02.25, 10:51:12] ~ Steve: Now they don't really bother ripping because we improved product and ads so they can't
[13.02.25, 10:55:39] ~ Rick: You can just easily do DMCAs right
[13.02.25, 10:56:00] ~ Rick: I have a VA do that constantly. Ripped ads are raken offline in 1-3 days normally
[13.02.25, 10:56:56] ~ Nebil: Off of Facebook?
[13.02.25, 10:58:56] ~ Rick: Yes
[13.02.25, 10:59:38] ~ Mason Schulze: I've been running for 3 years with my brand, never seen anyone rip my ads before until now
[13.02.25, 11:00:13] ~ Mason Schulze: So when people steal your content you just leave them be ?
[13.02.25, 11:01:29] ~ Daniel: I have a brand protection agent who takes them down, working w him for 2 years and happy with the results, I can share the contact, he sends letters to fb, hosting, Shopify, Google & takes them down from every possible platform
[13.02.25, 11:02:13] ~ Mason Schulze: Please share if you can bro
[13.02.25, 12:59:20] ~ Filippo: Anyone paying insurance in case supplier mess up?

[13.02.25, 16:52:34] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey everybody any insider help in stripe? I had a stripe which was good and warmed up till 7.5k instant payout. And was over a year old. I recently processed 3-4 orders with it and they not letting me process payments now.
[13.02.25, 16:56:16] ~ Jay More Than Scaling: Hey @⁨~Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari⁩ ! Yes we do have an excellent source on our team, would you like me to connect?
[13.02.25, 16:56:24] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yessir dmed you
[13.02.25, 17:54:34] ~ Musawer: Hey guys, we contact content creators via email but when we send them emails we don't get any response. The emails are most likely going to spam. Is there any solution or software to prevent it from going to spam?
[13.02.25, 17:55:24] ~ Rick: what type of mail u use?
[13.02.25, 18:02:06] ~ Musawer: We use our own domain email
[13.02.25, 18:24:29] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone running valentines dedicated creatives for their beauty brand? Is it performing well?
[13.02.25, 18:50:56] ~ Ben Mansour: Not beauty
[13.02.25, 18:51:30] ~ Ben Mansour: But same winners with a valentines sale banner
[13.02.25, 18:51:38] ~ Ben Mansour: And bof statics with valentines theme
[13.02.25, 18:54:59] ~ Landon: How do you guys handle blocking pages that are constantly leaving a spam link/discount on your ads? I’ve been blocking the pages but this guy has like 1000 pages.
[13.02.25, 18:55:50] ~ Ben Mansour: Ban the link he uses from comments
[13.02.25, 18:55:55] ~ Ben Mansour: It will be automatically hidden
[13.02.25, 18:56:48] ~ Landon: I’ve been doing that too but he keeps using new links
[13.02.25, 18:57:37] ~ Ben Mansour: Shit
[13.02.25, 18:57:55] ~ Ben Mansour: Idk bro, i guess keep banning until he stops
[13.02.25, 22:10:48] ~ Bryan T: Anyone doing any digital dropshipping off etsy?
[13.02.25, 23:47:44] ~ Samy: Anyone know an AI/bot that can summarize messages in whatsapp?
[14.02.25, 0:31:19] ~ Parker Godfrey: When you guys are stuck with a seasonal product, how bad does performance get when you are out of season?
[14.02.25, 0:40:32] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Does someone have a recommendation for a funnelish page builder?
[14.02.25, 0:40:36] ~ Aaron Ware: Fuk no. I found the persons personal phone and meta profile. Called them directly. 

I don’t think it’s ever going to be someone ‘bigger’ than you messing with you. It’s going to be some 19yr drop shipping kid that’s watched too many yt videos.

Had them taken down in 24 hours.
[14.02.25, 0:50:56] ~ Steve: Have fun playing whack a mole if that's you're approach
[14.02.25, 0:51:30] ~ Steve: Just part of the game at any level. You're gonna get ripped.

Even when I was CMO at 9 figure brands we were getting ripped
[14.02.25, 0:51:39] ~ Steve: Nooro was ripping us
[14.02.25, 0:51:44] ~ Steve: Everyone rips everyone
[14.02.25, 0:52:02] ~ Steve: You can either bitch and complain and fight it or just rise above with better marketing and brand
[14.02.25, 0:52:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: ‎This message was deleted.
[14.02.25, 0:52:39] ~ Alvaro De Prada: My bad 😂
[14.02.25, 0:53:09] ~ Al: Definitely agree with Steve, but takes very little effort having a couple of philos DMCAing left and right to anyone infringing trademark/copyright
[14.02.25, 0:53:25] ~ Aaron Ware: Just to be clear when I mean ripped I mean copy and paste site, stolen videos, content , copy everything. 

If you want to sit on sideline and let people take your money it’s up to you 😉
[14.02.25, 0:53:31] ~ Al: Costs like $50/week and sets a bit of a pace that we won't let you steal shit easily
[14.02.25, 0:53:35] ~ Steve: We were recently getting ripped by someone I know is way bigger than us. Ripping out hooks and angles and clips. I can either spend my energy fighting that, or spend my energy building a moat around the brand so that shit doesn't matter
[14.02.25, 0:54:01] ~ Al: 100%
[14.02.25, 0:54:04] ~ Aaron Ware: See this to me is not ripping bro. 

This is basically what Alex teaches with get hooked.
[14.02.25, 0:54:05] ~ Al: You can also do both 😂
[14.02.25, 0:55:26] ~ Omar: i thought ripping was right click save and run
[14.02.25, 0:55:42] ~ Al: If they have to copy you, they'll always need you. So I'm 100% on board. Look forward no doubt. My biz partner however made a good point that training a couple of philos to check weekly and take copycats down quickly will take a one time effort and 0 of our focus after, and he was right. We've taken down 100s of stores/meta ads
[14.02.25, 0:56:00] ~ Al: I can't measure how much it helps but I'm happy we did tbh and I don't even think about it
[14.02.25, 0:56:23] ~ Omar: yhh we got a VA that types our sentences in our vsl out and finds them that way
[14.02.25, 0:56:27] ~ Omar: can easily find
[14.02.25, 0:57:18] ~ Al: The smarter ones will always find a way though 😂 so those you can only win over by being indisputably better
[14.02.25, 0:57:36] ~ Steve: That's the conclusion you come to anyways
[14.02.25, 1:00:24] ~ Aaron Ware: How can you ever win ? 

Tomorrow you create your best VSL spend thousands making it and they launch it same day 👀
[14.02.25, 1:02:51] ~ Steve: It's just how It is man. This is why when I wrote for Vshred they would keep it close to the vest and not share it around and brag about a winner because they know they have 1 week MAX before it's ripped and tossed on clickbank
[14.02.25, 1:02:56] ~ Steve: Stefan does the same thing
[14.02.25, 1:03:09] ~ Steve: Same thing when I was running up wellness etc etc etc
[14.02.25, 1:03:27] ~ Steve: I've been at this a long time. It's just how it is
‎[14.02.25, 1:03:34] ~ Steve: ‎image omitted
[14.02.25, 1:04:03] ~ Steve: What do those brands do? Add spokespeople, better products, influencers, higher quality marketing, brand awareness etc
[14.02.25, 1:04:25] ~ Steve: So that when they do get ripped, it helps them because everyone knows who they are and knows what the real deal is
[14.02.25, 1:04:52] ~ Omar: is clickbank popular to find VSLs
[14.02.25, 1:04:54] ~ Omar: never used before
[14.02.25, 1:05:15] ~ Steve: Yeah there's lots of long form VSLs on click bank that convert like crazy
[14.02.25, 1:05:26] ~ Steve: Super aggressive though, especially for health. But there's lots there
[14.02.25, 1:05:28] ~ Steve: Maxweb too
[14.02.25, 1:06:05] ~ Steve: If you have a banger supplement VSL more than 20 minutes long, probably a good idea to be on CB or Maxweb
[14.02.25, 1:06:51] ~ Steve: Maxweb especially, they specialise in getting traffic to long form 30+ minute health VSLs. They're CEO she's a killer. Solid company
[14.02.25, 1:07:23] ~ Omar: interesting never thought to look on there
[14.02.25, 1:07:25] ~ Omar: thanks
[14.02.25, 1:07:44] ~ Steve: Yeah if you go that route and need and intro to maxweb happy to pass on
[14.02.25, 2:13:49] ~ Ben Mansour: How much do you pay your customer support agents?
[14.02.25, 2:41:31] ~ Mason Schulze: Who's using an all in one customer support software, to reply to all platform messages in one place and also have AI reply when off-line
[14.02.25, 3:00:29] ~ Al: Have better product, better CS, better shipping, better everything
[14.02.25, 3:01:29] ~ Al: They'll steal some sales but they can't steal brand if you do things better. People talk and catch on
[14.02.25, 5:10:12] ~ Jay More Than Scaling: Hey @⁨~Guy Edan⁩ ! We have an amazing one on our team. I can start a group and let you see some examples ?

[14.02.25, 11:27:16] ~ Damjan Topalovic: where tf do i find stock footage for old people, eg. an old man rolling around in bed tired?
[14.02.25, 11:37:05] Carlos Leeseman: I wouldn’t use stock footage for this. But more like “real life” footage. Much better to make the video more emotional engaging while watching. Use YouTube, TikTok, etc for this. Lot of good stuff
[14.02.25, 11:45:46] ~ Santi Roa: I don't understand. If they copy-paste your stuff, you can report them.

If you notice they copy your VSLs copy but recreating it, maybe you can test them in a fake page (so they don't copy you). Once you find a winner, copyright the copy/structure and then you own the rights to it
[14.02.25, 11:46:12] ~ Santi Roa: Meanwhile, differentiate your product, your marketing, your offers in a way others can't
[14.02.25, 11:48:19] ~ Santi Roa: Anyways, in the end, anything can be copied, except your purpose.
That's the only thing no one can copy. The culture can somehow be imitated but is hard as well

 So, work on that. Find a purpose bigger than making money with a VSL, and build a culture other's can't compete with

[14.02.25, 14:39:30] ~ Omar: Captions basically
[14.02.25, 14:39:45] ~ ECOM BULLS: yes i make sure the captions fit in 4:5 ratio
[14.02.25, 14:40:11] ~ ECOM BULLS: btw do you also run 4:5 ad i never create a 4:5 version rather i let fb crop the 9:16 video
[14.02.25, 14:40:52] ~ Omar: But then when it shows on reels does it fit?
[14.02.25, 14:41:27] ~ Omar: I just run profile for fb
[14.02.25, 14:42:56] ~ ECOM BULLS: yes it shows 9:16 ad by default
[14.02.25, 14:43:28] ~ Omar: Ahh ok ok it will blur top and bottom
[14.02.25, 14:43:37] ~ Omar: And show as a square right
[14.02.25, 14:45:15] ~ ECOM BULLS: no
[14.02.25, 14:46:12] ~ ECOM BULLS: just upload 9:16 and it will not crop or blur the video for reels because 9:16 is perfect for it, but for news feed placements it crops it to 4:5.

[14.02.25, 14:55:02] ~ Brice: I wouldn’t overthink it just aim more for the middle of the screen with all the important stuff and you’ll be alright
[14.02.25, 14:55:18] ~ ECOM BULLS: correct ✅
[14.02.25, 14:57:54] ~ ECOM BULLS: the thumbnail is not letting me fit my best performing headline.. why is fb showing thumbnail in headline ?
[14.02.25, 14:59:10] ~ Jonny: for those guys who are being ripped, here's what we did when it happened to us in the past (cant directly correlate but they stopped running our creatives after a week or so)

take your worst 3-5 creatives that are shit (KPIs wise), launch a campaign with them in for like $5 a day. Dupe them each 50-100 times. Then when competitors look on your ad library, they'll think these are top performers based on how many of the same creative is running.
[14.02.25, 14:59:27] ~ Gustavo Drumm: is meta down?
[14.02.25, 14:59:45] ~ Gustavo Drumm: cant access billing and events manager
[14.02.25, 15:00:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: its bugging jeah
[14.02.25, 15:01:25] ~ Omar: This is smart
[14.02.25, 15:01:40] ~ Omar: Thank you
[14.02.25, 15:04:25] ~ Jonny: no problem. 

I see people in here going back to the statement of "make better ads" .... of course this is true. But if you keep making better ads, and they keep getting ripped, where do you draw the line? Business is cut throat, can't just let your assets that you've spent money and time on be ripped constantly by 18 year old Freddy in his mums basement.
[14.02.25, 15:07:22] ~ Omar: Nah that’s very smart bro
[14.02.25, 15:07:33] ~ Omar: Can even run engagement campaign run up likes comments ‎<This message was edited>
[14.02.25, 15:08:55] ~ Musawer: Hey guys, does anyone working with casting agencies, please dm me
[14.02.25, 15:15:02] ~ Steve: Build moat is what's meant by better ads. Build a brand that is hard to rip
[14.02.25, 15:16:29] ~ Steve: Not gonna say how but I have access to every single ad and folder of a 35m/year brand. Raw video, 14 months of their ads.

And I couldn't rip a single one of them if I wanted to. 

Why? Because they're super branded, a wide variety of styles, focused on their product and brand name, with endorsers, their products in the videos, being used by real people etc etc.
[14.02.25, 15:16:43] ~ Steve: So I can take the ideas but I can't rip the ads and repurpose them for myself
[14.02.25, 15:16:51] ~ Jonny: Agreed
[14.02.25, 15:17:11] ~ Steve: But if all their ads in there were AI generated, with AI voice overs, selling the exact same product to the same customer with the same claims.....easy as pie to rip off
‎[14.02.25, 15:17:29] ~ ECOM BULLS: ‎image omitted
[14.02.25, 15:18:22] ~ Gustavo Drumm: the tracking also? I can’t access the events manager, and the tracking is also way off
[14.02.25, 15:18:47] ~ Steve: And that's what most people are doing. Like, so many people are entering the market just to sell just another knee massager to 55+ year old boomers and odds are they ripped off someone else's shit. Then I see these same people bitch when it happens to them lol like what do you expect?
[14.02.25, 15:18:47] ~ Gustavo Drumm: my first day of testing this product setup, and my only product
[14.02.25, 15:19:35] ~ Omar: would of been sick if there was a place where u could sell patented products
[14.02.25, 15:19:43] ~ Omar: and only a certain amount of ppl can sell
[14.02.25, 15:21:34] ~ ECOM BULLS: the vsls are very easy to copy as well because the ads don't show the product mostly
[14.02.25, 15:24:24] ~ ECOM BULLS: i rip ads and run it with woo commerce, no dmca issues with woo commerce
[14.02.25, 15:24:53] ~ Omar: LOL yhyh thats a good way not to get dmca

[14.02.25, 23:17:36] ~ Bryan T: We are, my supplier said they'd refund us the cost thankfully, I think in your case they were trying to get around the tax exemption before it was suspended, one of our suppliers gave us a similar option

[15.02.25, 10:58:38] ~ Nikola Petkov: This is what they gave me: 
Why your money is on hold
PayPal is holding a reserve of $15,000.00 USD of your existing funds. Additionally, PayPal is holding a reserve of 30% of your funds over 90 days for all of your business transactions. The reserve is money from incoming payments that we set aside in your PayPal account to cover losses due to chargebacks, claims or payment reversals.
PayPal is also withholding (for 21 days) any money above $132,740.00 USD in sales each month because:
We noticed an unusually large increase in your sales activity.

[15.02.25, 13:03:29] ~ Filippo: gotcha

[17.02.25, 2:30:05] Topi: Poorly done engagement definitely can destroy your FB ecosystem

[17.02.25, 7:48:18] ~ Austin: *25% CR Difference, how to solve* Hey guys my CR dropped by 25%  I thought it was bad FB health scores? Could be maxing out the market, could be ad fatigue, tested it all. Well last week seen a bad YT review of the product, I seen it was a simple over site on our fulfillment department and the product could easily be swapped, I I reached out via email sent apologies and solutions while also asking him to take it down until he can review a correct product and sent various review locations like Amazon and website to show we have great reputation. He agreed and took it down by next day, not only that but was already saying he was looking forward to mentioning how sincere and responsive the customer service was….LITERALLY OVER NIGHT CR JUMPED 25% !!! Here’s the deal, customers see the ad, want to buy and then research on YT. That’s our only bad review amongst 5-6 good ones but that single review was getting 1-2K views per week from a very small 1k YT channel, bottom line is CONTACT YT CREATERS have them make positive videos and IMMEDIATELY respond to bad ones…that 1-2 week negative review literally cost me between 75-100k revenue by averaging out CR…learned the lesson hopefully that helps you guys as well.

[17.02.25, 12:10:41] ~ RS: When you build post purchase upsells in funnelish, Do you always put the original product as first upsell at a discounted prices and after that you offer other products?
[17.02.25, 12:11:54] ~ Rick: depends
[17.02.25, 12:11:59] ~ Rick: a/b test it

[17.02.25, 15:20:25] ~ Al: You a real one Austin. Thanks for the share and 100% populating YT with good reviews is a system in itself and it'll do wonders
[17.02.25, 15:57:03] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys
Would love ur thoughts on this - last week we launched a few ads that were “product comparison between competitors” and it sent to a page that looks like an article comparing the products.
It did really well and we tripled the budget within days with it continuing to do well, and the conversion rate was solid as well. Suddenly after a week, it just stopped performing all together, and since then we tested many new ads with a similar message, and some are doing ok, but the conversion rate is not anywhere near what it was last week. Last week the conversion on those was like 3.5% and this week on good days it was like 1.5% and we can’t seem to scale those creatives beyond $100/day 

What can be the reason for that, that for a week it destroyed (in a good way) and the following it barely converts?
[17.02.25, 16:31:45] ~ Mehmet: What is your target audience range?

Is this a custom conversion?

If it is a custom conversion, has data been collected from at least 1,000 people?
[17.02.25, 16:45:46] ~ Guy Edan: It’s broad. Women 40+ 
Not a custom conversation
[17.02.25, 16:46:05] ~ Filippo: what video hosting platform do you use to embed a VSL in Funnelish?
[17.02.25, 16:55:57] ~ Andrea: VTURB
[17.02.25, 17:05:00] ~ harshil Thummar: Any one know case when you don't pay the facebook invoice on time what they do and what can we expect?
[17.02.25, 17:05:30] ~ Nebil: They pause ads after 16-22 days
[17.02.25, 17:05:45] ~ Nebil: Once you pay it back it’s reinstated
[17.02.25, 17:06:08] ~ Nikola Petkov: Sometimes they might lower the daily spending limit on the ad acc also.
[17.02.25, 17:29:47] ~ Filippo: how about VIMEO?
[17.02.25, 17:32:33] ~ Andrea: Haven't used
[17.02.25, 17:35:00] ~ harshil Thummar: They do anything to collect the amount or just they pause the ad?
[17.02.25, 17:52:40] ~ Nikola Petkov: Pause the ad, nothing more. You can't use the ad acc until you pay. Not sure if they take further actions after some time period tho.
[17.02.25, 19:51:26] ~ Dorian: ok thank you ! can you give me the contact please
[17.02.25, 19:58:02] ~ Growg: yep sure, DMing you bro

[18.02.25, 0:24:06] ~ Steph: We've done some tracking set ups for clients. Still in beta I beleive
[18.02.25, 4:10:38] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys is there any way to get on App lovin if youre spending less than 20k a day?
[18.02.25, 9:22:23] ~ Nim: No. Can make intro but needs to be >20k/day and US market ‎<This message was edited>
[18.02.25, 13:35:42] ~ Mikael: Anyone ever had issue with wetracked meta tracking?

We use wetracked for google + meta. But meta is over reporting all the timr according to all data every where.
Meta is over reporting with about 20-30% in total which is insane. Anyone had this issue or know a FB tracking expert?
[18.02.25, 14:57:56] ~ Brice: Thats usually an issue with FB taking credit for Google sales. FB says it’s a FB sale. google tracks it as a google sale. That’s why you need good third party tracking. Hard to get FB to not take credit for everything
[18.02.25, 14:58:39] ~ Mikael: hmm, do you have any good solution for this?
[18.02.25, 15:00:14] ~ Brice: Use a third party tracking to make major decisions and check all your data use the data inside the dashboard as directional it’s not wrong it’s just super aggressive attribution tracking by FB
[18.02.25, 15:00:38] ~ Brice: I think trying to get your FB data to line up exactly with your third party data is time wasted
[18.02.25, 15:01:16] ~ Brice: Unless you can see FB is legit double counting sales that it shouldnt be (which usually isn’t the case with Shopify) it’s probably not a tracking setup issue it’s attribution ‎<This message was edited>
[18.02.25, 15:09:23] ~ Mikael: Yeah we use wetracked for both. But maybe it would be better to only use triple whale for FB and wetracked for google?
[18.02.25, 15:11:39] ~ Matt: Has anyone tried running ads via a new ad account with same pixel and seen better results? Our media buyer has done this with a few clients and seen efficiency’s improve with exactly the same ads somehow, any ideas why this would happen?
[18.02.25, 15:38:21] ~ Ben Mansour: I recommend using elevar for everything
[18.02.25, 18:34:17] ~ Arad Khazabi: hey guys, whats youre go to funnel builder for sales pages/adv?

funnelish?, replo?; gempages, pagefly, etc.. ‎<This message was edited>
[18.02.25, 18:34:35] ~ Yente Dhooge: Funnelish
[18.02.25, 18:35:14] ~ Charles: Always been on Funnelish but heard that Pagedeck was really good
[18.02.25, 18:35:36] ~ RS: Funnelish is great for start. But as I understand, big guys are switching to checkout champ.
[18.02.25, 18:44:46] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys, does anyone here do a post purchase upsell for supplements?
[18.02.25, 19:00:02] ~ Matthew Martorano: If any of you want to see why so many brands are and have switched to Checkout Champ, we’d be happy to show you. It’s fast, the v2 builder superior, and it’s a conversion machine.
[18.02.25, 22:12:27] ~ Santi Roa: Interested!
[18.02.25, 22:13:19] ~ Santi Roa: I’ll DM you
[19.02.25, 0:03:05] ~ Davide: Anyone runs advertorial —> funnelish —> product page with Google Ads too?
[19.02.25, 0:04:17] ~ Christopher Murphy: Anyone here running VSL landing pages? I have a few questions
[19.02.25, 1:15:44] ~ Henry: Hey guys, does anyone know how to get past the Health & Wellness category on our domain from the Meta update? We’ve changed all the “disease specific” copy to pure symptoms already but we’re still getting classified. It finally hit us 2 days ago and performance has dropped way down (2.3 ROAS to ~1.2). Not sure what to do so I would appreciate any advice
[19.02.25, 1:48:00] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. 
Did anyone test and can share their results on showing deep discounts such as (for example) 
- One bottle: 50% 
- ⁠Two bottles: 60% 
- ⁠Three bottles: 70% 

As opposed to 25%, 37%, 50% for example
[19.02.25, 1:55:15] ~ Aaron Ware: Does anyone know if running those aggressive discounts effects CPM?
[19.02.25, 2:47:28] ~ Nal: Does anyone here sell womans clothing? If so, please drop me a dm. Have a couple questions and would greatly appreciate it.
[19.02.25, 3:35:02] ~ Charles: Let me know if you find anything aswell, same thing happened for me. But did your ROAS drop day to day or like after a week it is wayyy down? We panicked at first but realized that ours didn’t change much on longer timeline.
[19.02.25, 3:55:25] ~ Henry: Immediate drop. Our ROAS has been ~2.4 up to Sunday and then this week, it dropped to a 1.4. CPM up 42%, sales drop 50%, and CPC up 25% so I’m suspicious that it’s because of the update. We extended the categorization last time to 30 days and that just recently passed
[19.02.25, 4:02:03] ~ Aaron Ware: Check ads library for someone copied and paste your ads.
[19.02.25, 4:09:05] ~ Henry: Do you know what’s the best way to do this? Thank you regardless 🙌
[19.02.25, 6:54:53] ~ Aaron Ware: Search for key words you use in your copy
[19.02.25, 6:55:38] ~ Aaron Ware: Do you guys all see a huge reduction in CRO now in Feb compared to Q4 ?
[19.02.25, 6:55:49] ~ Aaron Ware: What sort of allowance do you accept ?
[19.02.25, 6:56:37] ~ Aaron Ware: For example my store was hitting 3.5% in Nov and now it’s struggling at 1.5%
[19.02.25, 6:57:57] ~ Ry: Yes. For the past week. From 3+% to 1-2% days
[19.02.25, 10:46:26] ~ Malik: I see a decline in performances since around 6-8 days
[19.02.25, 10:49:47] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys does anyone optimize based on highest AOV instead of number of purchases on facebook? Is there a difference
[19.02.25, 11:35:21] ~ Rick: You also mention that you have changed the copy on your site to sonething not directly pointing towards “the disease”. How have you concluded that this isn’t causing your drop in sales?
[19.02.25, 12:19:03] ~ Filippo: anyone here using credit card for ads?

i dont but looking to find a way to get one (i was kicked from amex)
[19.02.25, 12:19:30] ~ Filippo: but last time i used amex for ads they lowered my limit because i hit the limit (paradox)

[19.02.25, 15:49:24] ~ Wouter: What do you guys do when targeting other countries? Have com co.uk and com.au urls and seperate shopify stores? We always do it like this but thinking about migrating it all together
[19.02.25, 15:52:57] ~ Ben Mansour: Just different product pages
[19.02.25, 15:53:12] ~ Ben Mansour: Make it feel local to that country
[19.02.25, 15:53:39] ~ Wouter: But we think that a .co.uk helps for uk customers
[19.02.25, 15:53:43] ~ Wouter: Give more trust
[19.02.25, 15:53:54] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes can be
[19.02.25, 15:54:25] ~ Ben Mansour: But honetly running multiple stores can be a hassle sometimes, easier to have everything in one store
[19.02.25, 15:54:32] ~ Ben Mansour: If you have shopify+
[19.02.25, 15:54:43] ~ Ben Mansour: You can have a subdomain for each country i think
[19.02.25, 15:54:51] ~ Ben Mansour: Like uk.yourbrand.com
[19.02.25, 15:55:47] ~ Wouter: In shopify +?
[19.02.25, 15:56:33] ~ Rick: yes
[19.02.25, 17:04:26] ~ Henry: Because I changed it many weeks ago and ROAS was still high for me
[19.02.25, 17:09:51] ‪+31 6 40616624‬: ‎‎‪+31 6 40616624‬ changed their phone number to a new number. ‎Tap to message new number.

[20.02.25, 0:52:05] Topi: its facebook bot traffic scraping your website, happens every time you launch ads, nothing to worry about
[20.02.25, 6:00:08] ~ Mikael: Hey, what landing pages and checkouts are you guys using and seeing best results with? shopify? funnelish? checkout champ?

[21.02.25, 0:55:03] ~ Charles: But the thing is I think it created a product in the catalog from the variant it created when I was doing the test and now that we do not have it he dont want to run unless this variant is created again. It seems like I cant associate it back to the original product. I might have no choice to just publish it again like it was a new ad and lose all optimization…
[21.02.25, 0:56:56] ~ Christopher Murphy: Hmmm, not sure sorry boss

[21.02.25, 17:20:14] ~ Musawer: Do your campaigns work well for a few days, then suddenly go bad for a few days and then recover? What do you do? Do you reduce the budget? 

We also have difficulty finding an ad that is spent a lot on it, we find a lot of winner ads but when we put them in a scaling campaign, the performance drops immediately.
[21.02.25, 17:22:59] ~ LC: Usually means the ad isn’t good enough to be scaled/profitable at high spend
[21.02.25, 17:43:45] ~ Gideon: Do you use post id? Also try to scale the budget in the testing ad. Try different scaling campaigns. Adv+, cbo, abo with higher budget, costcap eventually
[21.02.25, 17:44:57] ~ Dorian: What is your campaign structure actually ? Do you scale on ABO, CBO or ADV+ ?
[21.02.25, 17:48:48] ~ Musawer: Yeah we are using post id, we tried everything, ABO CBO ASC+ cost cap bid cap, but Many of our ads do not work in the scale campaign even though their ROAS is higher than the target at testing
[21.02.25, 17:53:16] ~ Davide: Which types of ads worked better for you?
[21.02.25, 18:00:45] ~ Gideon: Did they got a good amount of spend before putting them to the scaling campaign
[21.02.25, 18:02:37] ~ Musawer: After an ad spends 1k and the metrics are at target, I put it into a scaling campaign, how do you do it?
[21.02.25, 18:03:20] ~ Gideon: That should be fine. Do you exclude existing customers?
[21.02.25, 18:03:39] ~ Musawer: Yes
[21.02.25, 18:08:29] ~ Gideon: Okay. Have you tried different cost caps? At aov 20 euro under and 20 euro above it?
[21.02.25, 18:35:39] ~ Musawer: Yeah i tried before but i wanna know how's you guys structure, lets say you testing something, what you do when it not working

No changes to the LP or offer and was historically a stable performer for last 4 months. Is this likely just a creative problem with it just tapering off or anything else i should look at? Should I just turn it off at this stage? Thanks for any help

[22.02.25, 1:32:42] ~ Mert M: Anyone know good connect for itin number usa
[22.02.25, 6:58:25] ~ Steve: Anyone with advice on what to do after getting DCMA’d?

We were cooking really well in a scaling ad set. Unfortunately 2 of the 6 ads in that set used a clip from a podcast and the podcast requested that it be taken down and FB just decided to slap the entire ad set - even the ads in there that don’t have the clip
[22.02.25, 6:58:35] ~ Steve: we relaunched those ads, and are recutting the winners to remove that clip and we should be good
[22.02.25, 6:59:21] ~ Steve: my concern is - does this usually affect health of the ad account? Should we consider getting a new one?

This is the first thing that’s ever even happened on the account. We have had maybe 1 or 2 ad rejections in total over the life of the account so we’re in pretty good standing, no shady shit
[22.02.25, 7:02:43] ~ Aaron Ware: $1k month
[22.02.25, 8:15:31] Marek Olszewski: Get it checked by an insider for some internal flags, but normally the more ads you publish (that get auto-approved) the higher the trust score of your ad acc. I’m assuming that before this happened none of your ads would have been rejected, which means that trust score was relatively high.

Sidenote: I had a similar issue last year, it never affected performance
[22.02.25, 8:30:07] ~ Steve: Yeah my media buyer thinks the same, just wanted a double check on it. Performance is insanely down today but not surprising since 6 scaling ads were nuked. Once the new edited versions go up should be better
[22.02.25, 8:30:08] ~ Steve: Thanks

[22.02.25, 16:42:36] ~ Gideon: Higher the amount after a few hours if spend is not picking up. You can check hourly spend in facebook. Also you can compare it with other days to see normal spend rhytm and compare it
[22.02.25, 16:44:33] ~ Gideon: Guys, I got a question. We have a 2 bestsellers which we advertise with. Recently we launched a lot of new products with potential to become a bestseller.

He is not a US resident but registered his LLC and got the EIN too

But Shopify payment is still now allowing him due to their revised policies and asking for ITN. 

They have applied for ITIN too by adding a US resident in the company. 

But the issue is it will take them another 120 days to get ITIN. 

Can anyone recommend a solution to speed the things up. Their launch is on hold since 3 months just because of this issue.
[25.02.25, 17:43:34] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Read this convo if it helps you bro @⁨~Muhammad Hamza⁩
[25.02.25, 17:46:00] ~ Antonio Celani: no
[25.02.25, 17:48:24] ~ Ben Mansour: You should talk to shopify support and tell them that you are not using resident and that you are using ein instead of ssn and they will fix it for you
[25.02.25, 17:48:39] ~ Ben Mansour: Takes like 1 week to solve
[25.02.25, 17:48:55] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Okay let us try this
[25.02.25, 17:49:53] ~ Nal: In this case, do they not ask for proof of substantial business presence within the US? Like a warehouse etc
[25.02.25, 17:56:34] ~ Ben Mansour: They didn‘t ask me
[25.02.25, 17:56:38] ~ Ben Mansour: I told them

[25.02.25, 21:31:47] ~ Mike Ramsey: Be careful inserting an EIN in lieu of an ITIN - particularly if this account isn’t warmed up at all.  This can be ripe for a hold or shutdown if you get through and start to process on this.  Remember, Shopify Payments is really Stripe as it is Stripe’s back-end and their banking partners have changed and tightened requirements.

I have seen this slip through the cracks using an EIN vs. an ITIN, but a majority of the time when you start to use it and scale aggressively then it gets stopped for a major hold.  You’ll either want an ITIN or a US signer to ensure stability or another processor that is more flexible if this is a new store.

And it’s tax time in the US and DOGE is firing everyone.  Gonna be a wait unfortunately.

Those who skims the adv buys so to make Adv effective it should be written in a way thay easily skimable for quick decision.

[26.02.25, 16:56:54] ~ Nicolò: yeah, I think it's this, most days have roas below 2, also the sales product has a cr of 50% only leading to checkout, I should somehow increase it, do you have any tips?
[26.02.25, 16:59:08] ~ Yente Dhooge: So 50% of the sales page visitors go to the checkout? Thats pretty good.

How much % goes from advertorial to sales page? 

And what is your cvr?
[26.02.25, 17:26:33] ~ Nicolò: 45/50% always

[27.02.25, 20:38:49] ~ Bryan T: Is having livechat on my website worth it? Or just email? Considering ditching livechat
[27.02.25, 21:38:18] ~ UHO: Live chat is a powerful tool for engaging visitors, providing support and generating leads—mine brings in a high volume of inquiries with a 36% close rate, especially when ads are running. Instead of removing it, consider adding a chatbot to ensure visitors get answers even when you’re unavailable.
[27.02.25, 21:39:54] ~ Mithiran: Did you run a split test to see if the live chat  improves conversion rates? Just wondering, how do you know whether those inquiries wouldn’t have converted without it?
[27.02.25, 21:46:23] Topi: yes
[27.02.25, 22:47:30] ~ Mason Schulze: Which software are you using for chatbot to answer when not online
[27.02.25, 22:54:29] ~ UHO: lol. Good question, but no, we didn’t do the AB test.

Generally, people engage more when they see a live chat widget, as it feels immediate and accessible compared to searching for a contact page and copying + pasting emails.

Beyond sales, it has also reduced support tickets by providing instant answers, streamlining both new customer acquisition and service.
[27.02.25, 22:55:36] ~ UHO: There are tons like HubSpot, Zendesk, Zoho, but we built ours in-house.

[28.02.25, 18:55:15] ~ Filippo: cause i literally need an LLC for uS processors, so its smth i must have
[28.02.25, 18:55:18] ~ Filippo: yep
[28.02.25, 18:55:27] ~ Ben Mansour: If you operate your whole business with the llc
[28.02.25, 18:55:35] ~ Ben Mansour: And italy finds out
[28.02.25, 18:55:35] ~ Rick: ask to your commercialista
[28.02.25, 18:55:47] ~ Rick: but this is not good
[28.02.25, 18:55:48] ~ Ben Mansour: They will tax your whole llc revenue
[28.02.25, 18:55:56] ~ Ben Mansour: Like personal income tax
[28.02.25, 18:56:11] ~ Filippo: how the heck am i supposed to run ads
[28.02.25, 18:56:11] ~ Ben Mansour: 40% or sthg that‘s the case in germany
[28.02.25, 18:56:59] ~ Ben Mansour: Best thing to do
[28.02.25, 18:57:06] ~ Ben Mansour: Singapore holding that owns llc
[28.02.25, 18:57:21] ~ Ben Mansour: Even if italy finds out
[28.02.25, 18:57:25] ~ Ben Mansour: They can do nothing to you
[28.02.25, 18:57:37] ~ Filippo: i dont have resources to put all this together i just got the LLC cause i got shutdown by stripe and needed new processors
[28.02.25, 18:58:18] ~ Filippo: just wanted to know how to start paying ads with money under new LLC, cause all money is into old bank account…im sure i can fix the italy-llc stuff later this year
[28.02.25, 18:58:49] ~ Ben Mansour: Just pay money with italian account
[28.02.25, 18:58:57] ~ Ben Mansour: And revenue goes in llc account
[28.02.25, 18:59:03] ~ Ben Mansour: Then you start having money in usa
[28.02.25, 18:59:39] ~ Filippo: yeah maybe this is the simplest and best way
[28.02.25, 19:02:23] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you are trying to do it the right way (italy knowing that you have an LLC). You need to ask your accountant how to do it.
[28.02.25, 19:02:24] ~ Omar: nominee director and shareholder
[28.02.25, 19:02:43] ~ Omar: when italy finds out u got a company and ur a director abroad

[28.02.25, 19:03:42] ~ Filippo: maybe i explained myself wrong. but what im doing is just getting new LLC for new processors, then i also plan to fix the italy stuff in 1-3 months…its not that im gonna run millions without setting up the stuff properly in Italy
[28.02.25, 19:04:06] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you want to do it the wrong way (italy not knowing) you need to create a bridge between SRL and LLC. So send money to a company you don’t own, and that company sends the money to LLC
[28.02.25, 19:07:05] ~ Filippo: i mean..i wanna do it the right way but i dont wanna overdo  it rn..i need to speed things up and getting the LLC took more than 1 month.

i think I can just pay ads
[28.02.25, 19:07:20] ~ Filippo: with old account
[28.02.25, 19:08:58] ~ Filippo: im not going to process millions with a sloppy setup. Just wanted to know how to start running ads back again using old money
[28.02.25, 19:10:51] ~ Ben Mansour: Yep, italy won‘t find out day 1
[28.02.25, 19:11:02] ~ Ben Mansour: You have much time to figure all out
[28.02.25, 19:15:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: What country is the bank account where the money is held right now
[28.02.25, 19:16:08] ~ Filippo: I use Revolut, so that is Lituania
[28.02.25, 19:16:39] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Then you are “good” to move the money to the LLC.
[28.02.25, 19:17:10] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Or even spend it in ads and let the LLC load with revenue money
[28.02.25, 19:17:31] ~ Filippo: how about just using the money as ive done? and then start using LLC money once the new bank account fill up?
[28.02.25, 19:17:39] ~ Filippo: thats it
[28.02.25, 19:20:50] ~ Charles: Did you got force to stop your ads or you were able to keep making money in the whole process
[28.02.25, 19:21:16] ~ Filippo: i got shutdown by stripe, so havent ran ads since jan 12th
[28.02.25, 19:22:20] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Stripe is under your name right?
[28.02.25, 19:22:29] ~ Filippo: yep
[28.02.25, 19:22:38] ~ Filippo: i have a hold til May
[28.02.25, 19:22:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Then italy already knows about your revenue
[28.02.25, 19:22:44] ~ Filippo: and cant process
[28.02.25, 19:22:53] ~ Alvaro De Prada: So doesn’t matter what you do or how you do it
[28.02.25, 19:23:25] ~ Filippo: yeah , maybe this came out wrong but i just wanted a quick “doable” solution to start using the money now
[28.02.25, 19:23:38] ~ Filippo: of course im going to fix the italian stuff next few months
[28.02.25, 19:23:46] ~ Filippo: im not going to jail for a few china products
[28.02.25, 19:24:51] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah. What I mean is that it doesn’t matter really. Your accountant will try to fix it.

But best way is just use the revolut money for ads and then move on
[28.02.25, 19:25:01] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Don’t send money from Revolut to LLC
[28.02.25, 19:25:11] ~ Filippo: lets go!
[28.02.25, 19:25:42] ~ Filippo: should I change the ad account company details so the invoices are to the new LLC even if I paid with this old money?
[28.02.25, 19:28:23] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I’ll leave it as is until you have emptied the account and once you start paying with LLC money I’d change the details
[28.02.25, 19:28:48] ~ Filippo: do you use italian accountants?
[28.02.25, 19:28:55] ~ Filippo: or your tax stuff is taken care of abroad?
[28.02.25, 19:29:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I don’t have anything in italy (only this phone number 😂). I have accountants in each country I have a company
[28.02.25, 19:29:55] ~ Filippo: you give false hopes to the italians who want to stay in italy lol
[28.02.25, 19:30:07] ~ Filippo: change the number ahahah
[28.02.25, 19:30:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Ahhahahahah

Dont stay in italy. Is not worth it
[28.02.25, 19:30:34] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Once you have good money… run
[28.02.25, 19:30:57] ~ Filippo: even with ecommerce brand with italian customers?
[28.02.25, 19:31:38] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah… too much hassle to have an Italian structure to pay low taxes.

If you actually want to LIVE in italy, then that’s another thing
[28.02.25, 19:32:30] ~ Filippo: got it thanks
[28.02.25, 19:34:04] ~ Alvaro De Prada: you can have a 100% italian customers brand and live abroad. Just pay VAT
[28.02.25, 19:35:56] ~ Filippo: i see some italian businesses with LTD companies
[28.02.25, 19:36:05] ~ Filippo: like Energatto

[1.03.25, 0:26:14] ~ Denis Mihin: So I have a US LLC and live in Croatia. 
Already payed myself more than 50k through my LLC into my Croatian personal bank account

I contacted the tax authorities aswell, they just say I have to pay 10% income tax and 36% capital gains when I pay myself

So is this wrong, should I create a holding structure or something.

Im lost lol...

Everyone is telling us a different story

Also, I want to stay in Croatia for now

Any help please
[1.03.25, 0:29:57] ~ Denis Mihin: Where to go? Dubai?
[1.03.25, 0:37:16] ~ Phil: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ can guide you with this brother
[1.03.25, 0:56:45] ~ Alvaro De Prada: That depends on what you want in life. There are many countries where you pay close to zero tax. You shouldn’t look at where to move only because of taxes but many other things
[1.03.25, 0:58:19] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I’m no tax expert BUT if you only need to pay 10% income tax… is not bad at all.

36% capital gains is fucked up but would only hit you if you sell a store
[1.03.25, 0:58:56] ~ Denis Mihin: I pay that when I send money from Llc to personal bank acc
[1.03.25, 1:01:35] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Again... not a tax expert but... if you are paying yourself a set amount every month (5k) it counts as a salary=income so it would be a 10% tax. 

The capital gains might be hitting you because you are paying yourself many times as they are counting it as dividends? 

I would speak to a Croatian accountant specialized in Ecommerce 

And maybe do some chatgpt with deep research so he can give you more insights on Croatian tax law
[1.03.25, 1:54:04] ~ Bazeed: yes
[1.03.25, 1:54:53] ~ Bazeed: Pls find yourself an amazing accountant to not end up in a mess in a long run, every country has different law and they will be the best people to help you out.
[1.03.25, 3:38:31] ~ Charles: Do you guys 110% comply with any tax law everywhere? For example, I think Australia is over $75 000 in sales you have to pay some taxes am I right? And is there some recommandable agencies to keep you compliant everywhere you sell?
[1.03.25, 4:51:11] ~ Phil: Yeah Australia is over $75,000 for GST which is 10% of revenue.

But anything over I think 18k you start paying income tax but there are different tax brackets

[1.03.25, 11:00:50] ~ Alexander Sundström: Hey guys! We have some issues from Atc to purchase. We have drop of 80% these past couple of days. Does anyone have a contact that can audit and fix this issue?
[1.03.25, 18:54:02] ~ M A N U E L: Anyone noticed a HUGE decrease in performance from the 26 Feb?
[1.03.25, 18:54:59] ~ Mithiran: Just for last 2 days of the month

[1.03.25, 18:59:16] ~ LC: What do you guys use to test out different offers/pre landers?
[1.03.25, 22:46:48] ~ Gustavo Drumm: Hey guys,

My performance dropped significantly last week. I’m comparing to the days I scaled the most. What stands out is that the CPM more than doubled. Even tripled on some campaigns. 

My average CTR is the same. 
And LP conversion actually increased. 

I tested new ads and same performance.

What could be goin on?
[1.03.25, 22:57:24] ~ Ben Mansour: For everyone noticing bad performance
[1.03.25, 22:57:31] ~ Ben Mansour: Check your pixel events manager
[1.03.25, 22:57:50] ~ Ben Mansour: See if everything is alright, there may be an issue affecting your performance
[1.03.25, 23:23:07] ~ Gustavo Drumm: I does seem to have an issue with Click ID
[1.03.25, 23:23:17] ~ Gustavo Drumm: Will fix and see if goes back to normal
[2.03.25, 7:38:48] ~ Cody Chaffee: I have a pixel that has 40k+ conversions on it with one prod. I’m going to launch another prod in the same niche and put it in a dif ad acc. do y’all suggest using the same pixel or a different pixel for the new prod?
[2.03.25, 7:44:08] ~ harshil Thummar: Same

[2.03.25, 14:53:53] ~ Fabian: Opinions on this?
[2.03.25, 15:32:54] ~ Bazeed: I have seen this years ago but i reckon this is bs cause it messes up your tracking, it wont be as accurate as the normal pixel.
[2.03.25, 15:33:08] ~ Bazeed: also the guy saying this is a well known scammer so idk if he even cares bout tracking
[2.03.25, 16:00:37] ~ Gideon: Did you guys also got signed up automatically for shopify tax and pay a lot extra for something you didn't signed up for?
[2.03.25, 17:03:50] ~ Fabian: I was thinking that aswell, because the guy talking sounds like Leo / Soulja and this maybe works for him 

But he sells like hidden subscriptions and stuff ‎<This message was edited>

[3.03.25, 18:08:11] ~ Caesar: Where did you find your media buyer, if you don't mind me asking?
[3.03.25, 18:09:06] ~ Charles: Upwork. She didnt had a lot of experience but at this salary I was ok to train her
[3.03.25, 18:09:37] ~ Charles: But shes just launching my ads
[3.03.25, 18:09:49] ~ Charles: I’m still managing budgets
[3.03.25, 18:14:09] ~ Caesar: how many hours a day is she doing?
[3.03.25, 18:15:06] ~ Charles: She just did her first batch last week (We’re launching one weekly batch) and that took her 6 hours
[3.03.25, 18:16:21] ~ J: You could also try and find a Mediabuyer via Onlinejobs.ph, I hired my media buyer back in June and he is doing pretty good. I pay him $5p/h + performance bonusses.
[3.03.25, 18:24:35] ~ Charles: Does he have all 2FA and all that?

[3.03.25, 18:26:08] ~ J: We work with proxy's
[3.03.25, 18:27:30] ~ Charles: How did you setup that?
[3.03.25, 18:27:45] ~ J: 9 out of 10 times I work with guys out of the philippines with a proven track record. Do face to face calls and you are pretty safe.
[3.03.25, 18:28:34] ~ J: Incogniton, it pretty straight forward and I think there are a lot of video's out there.
[3.03.25, 18:29:16] ~ Charles: Might check this thank you
[3.03.25, 18:38:43] ~ Filippo: If you just need someone to launch you can use a mass launcher like Koast.ai

[4.03.25, 10:23:03] Carlos Leeseman: Yeah they changed a lot of stuff for sure
[4.03.25, 10:26:20] ~ Mikael: Do you know what they changed and maybe what kind of scaling works better now?

[5.03.25, 19:41:41] ~ Caesar: Guys, our PayPal fail rate has been 60% for the last 1 year, I’ve tested the gateway and all seems fine.

If you were in my shoes, would you just remove it all together?

12% of our customers use PayPal.
[5.03.25, 19:54:26] ~ Mason Schulze: What's fail rate?
[5.03.25, 20:05:49] ~ Caesar: Failed payment rate. 

As in, the amount of transactions which fail, when using that payment method.

Either because the customer cancelled themselves, or any other issue entirely.
[5.03.25, 20:18:15] ~ Mason Schulze: Where can you see this statistic
[5.03.25, 20:19:43] ~ Caesar: Funnelish analytics
[5.03.25, 20:20:27] ~ Mike Ramsey: That seems wrong.  Your failure rate in PayPal should not be that high as all transactions are within the PayPal wallet ecosystem (closed loop) and would not fail at that high of a rate as a traditional cross border credit card transaction.  Even a standard credit card transaction authorization rate cross border would be at 75-80% ‎<This message was edited>
[5.03.25, 20:21:47] ~ Mike Ramsey: And to confirm are you saying 60% are failing?  And only 40% is being approved?

If so, that’s a massive issue
[5.03.25, 20:21:50] ~ Caesar: Exactly, but we had it checked and got feedback that it works... so now i'm unsure what to do honestly
[5.03.25, 20:21:55] ~ Caesar: Correct.
[5.03.25, 20:22:10] ~ Caesar: I just never noticed it, since only 12% of our customer base uses PayPal.
[5.03.25, 20:24:31] ~ Mike Ramsey: That appears to be an integration issue with the platform you are running PayPal on.  I have never seen that low of an authorization rate in reviewing 1,000s of client accounts with PayPal.  

You’d be better off disabling it at this juncture until it’s fixed.  Otherwise, clients will just drop and not return
[5.03.25, 20:32:03] ~ Caesar: Exactly, will turn it off, thank you @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ 🙏
[5.03.25, 20:42:29] Carlos Leeseman: Hi guys, which app is best for subscription where bundles are important? Appstle, Recharge or Joy?

[5.03.25, 21:35:55] ~ Caesar: I think just the normal paypal honestly, paypal business

[6.03.25, 12:20:18] ~ Damjan Topalovic: At the round tables in Dubai I talked to some guy that said that there is an approved PayPal account provider called ‘’Reach’’ that sends money to your wise account. 

I don’t know if I understood the name right but I can’t find them on Google.

Does anyone know if i missed the name or i just cant find them for some reason? ‎<This message was edited>

[6.03.25, 20:28:35] ~ Charles: I copied my salespage from A to Z, had a better speed but for some reason wasnt converting at all
[6.03.25, 20:44:28] ~ J: We have issues where the metafields aren't taken over correctly, we only use it for the products and via those feed services you can add them as an option.

[6.03.25, 23:49:18] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey dark lords

I’d highly recommend Omnisend for email/sms, you basically get all features needed to hit extra 15-20% rev but 50% cheaper than klaviyo, mailchimp, etc

[7.03.25, 17:52:13] Carlos Leeseman: Triple duplicating can fuck up your results if it’s in learning phase. For some it works tho… I like to scale it after 3 days with 25-50%

[9.03.25, 16:16:05] ~ Austin: What funnel platforms do you find would work best for a brand with a ton of variants—anywhere from currently 600 but will grow to over 6,000 per page as each holds a selection of - over 300 gun models, left- and right-hand options, and soon, custom colors and features? Ideally, something that doesn’t require a coding developer for everything, but if one’s needed, that’s fine. I’ve heard good things about Checkout Champ and 29 Next, but I haven’t used either, so I’m open to recommendations and developer connections.

Were cooking 15-20k days 3x ROAS. Then DCMA and now just no momentum. Some days 3-5k other days barely 1k. Have cut dozens of ads, nothing hits. Store CVR like 1%. Just atrocious performance.
[11.03.25, 0:57:39] ~ Steve: We have an insider says he can get it removed but needs like 3 weeks. Don't know we can just sit and wait.

Thinking about: new ad account, new FB page, totally new domain, new sales pages, shoot all new footage with the product - so Meta's AI doesn't track anything on the brand. 

Not sure if worth it but willing to try. Anyone have any other success dealing with this?

Personally I wouldn’t want It to be anything flashy, but a time to really rub shoulders and grow exponentially. I live in North Carolina USA and living here’s not very expensive so we could find a place to stay for pretty low buy in. Please message if interested. ‎<This message was edited>

[11.03.25, 11:41:57] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hi Guys. I need your help. A few days ago, a huge company got our FB page taken down. The ads were performing really well—millions of views, thousands of positive engagements and comment reviews.

This is my first time dealing with this. I immediately reached out to both the brand and Facebook to request a removal of the restriction (though I know that’s unlikely). In the meantime, I created a new page using the same FB and ad account and relaunched the ads, but performance is significantly worse and that makes me think if I should have done something differently. Maybe try to restore the main page? Could you guide me what’s the best move here?
[11.03.25, 11:42:49] ~ Jeremy Khattar: @⁨~Nikola Petkov⁩ ping me brother, we have good connections at facebook and can definitely help you here 🙂

[12.03.25, 16:52:16] ~ Brandon: Hey Guys!

Were looking for an AI transcription and translation tool (or a Chrome extension) for our English Creative Analyst.

The ideal tool should automatically transcribe and translate audio from ads in different languages (e.g German Ad from Ad library) into English text—allowing her to understand scripts word for word without needing to download each creative manually.

Any Suggestions?
[12.03.25, 16:53:34] ~ Mert M: Thanks men

[12.03.25, 17:42:34] ~ Guy Edan: How do you guys go about testing new copy for creatives? 
I have the main angle that up to now used the same (or very similar) copy for new creatives, but thinking how should i test new copy. Do you suggest just duplicating new creatives with a different copy?
[12.03.25, 17:44:01] ~ Molka Sghaier: Tbh i tried it and i loved it
[12.03.25, 17:44:06] ~ Molka Sghaier: Its bad in video editing

[12.03.25, 17:44:17] ~ Molka Sghaier: In seconds
[12.03.25, 17:45:24] ~ Molka Sghaier: If ur referring to the ad copy our media buyer generates ad copies with chatgpt everytime he launches new creatives , they look cheesy af BUT THEY WORK LIKE CRAZY
[12.03.25, 17:45:48] ~ Molka Sghaier: I dont advice spending much time thinking about the ad copy id rather spend that time writing a new ad or somth
[12.03.25, 17:46:30] ~ Rick: For website speed optimization?
[12.03.25, 17:50:57] ~ Guy Edan: Yup exactly. Makes sense. Thanks
[12.03.25, 17:52:00] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yea, he’ll redo the whole code for u and he’ll not put any unnecessary things so the speed will improve ALOT

[12.03.25, 19:23:13] ~ Jonas M. Arnold: yessir
[12.03.25, 19:34:21] ~ Bryan T: What's your guys strategy for paying contractors/suppliers? I usually use payoneer in tandem with either the amex business platinum card (1.5x points on purchases over 5k) or the chase ink business premier card (2.5% back on purchases over 5k) this puts our fee for using credit cards at .5 to 1% per transaction (aiming for a 5K+ payment) and lets us use credit cards which helps for cash flow purposes but curious if someone has a better method.
[12.03.25, 20:31:22] ~ Jonny: We use payoneer with Amex Platinum too
[12.03.25, 20:40:47] ~ Steve: You find amex platinum better than gold? You use it for ad spend?
[12.03.25, 20:45:25] ~ A: Is it possible to pay ACH bank transfer with Amex platinum card, and how do u do it
[12.03.25, 21:00:45] ~ Jonny: Yeah we use it for all biz expenses where we can. Not sure if it differs from gold, but the other perks are good

[12.03.25, 21:10:09] ~ Steve: Yeah perks on plat look better but I've just heard everyone say gold is better if you're using it for ad spend and I can't figure out why it would be
[12.03.25, 21:12:34] ~ Steve: I pay a guy $5k a year to help me strategize which cards to open, how and when to use them (mostly on Facebook and Google ad spend). His team books almost all of my travel (business class flights and 5-star hotels) using points. I currently have 3million Amex points and 1.5m Chase points because of the strategy. Happy to introduce him to anyone who wants an intro.
[12.03.25, 21:12:37] ~ Steve: First $150k of ad spend on an Amex Gold gets you 4x. So 600k points. 

First $150k of ad spend on a Chase card gets you 3x. Or 450k points. 

I have 6 Amex Gold cards and 2 Chase cards and spending at least $250k a month presently. So that generates a lot of points super quickly.

[12.03.25, 22:06:49] ~ Carlos: Hey guys, the Operations Manager I’m looking to hire is wanting to get paid $3,500 + 5% profit share. He has 5 years experience working with a multi-8 figure brand/store and is basically able to do it all. It’s my first time hiring for this position.

Is $3,500 monthly + 5% profit share a reasonable compensation for an Operations Manager?

What do you pay your Operations Manager or what do you recommend paying for this position?  (If you don’t mind sharing) ‎<This message was edited>
[12.03.25, 22:21:37] Leon REMODE: Hey Carlos,

It’s reasonable BUT! you need to connect the profit share to hard-accountability for some real achievements. ( you can build a range of profit share per ticked off achievable) 

Giving it right off the bat, will make it feel that things come easy, and acrually reduces his engagement. 

Whereas he gets to play a few levels of game to unlock this, the knife cuts at both ends.

[13.03.25, 9:32:09] ~ Timur: Hey guys, do you collect sales tax? We are doing almost 1M/month and have never done this before. Could you share an expert/service for a sales tax solution you are working with?
[13.03.25, 9:56:07] ~ Bazeed: Hey guys, anyone here that was using hypersku/other dropshipping suppliers that switched to bestfulfil? Was it worth the switch? In terms of fulfilment, dashboard,
[13.03.25, 9:57:42] Carlos Leeseman: Yessir. Bestfulfill is doing a great job, specially when you switch to branded dropshipping or fully branding. They helped me customize my own product, use better shipping lines, etc. They also gave me a PayPal account and cashflow solutions

[13.03.25, 14:48:10] ~ Chris Rivera: Taxjar and zamp have good automated solutions but you need to be very careful if you have multichannel revenues.  

At this scale it may make more sense to work with an accounting firm.

[13.03.25, 15:33:53] ~ Nikola Petkov: You can try Retrevo, it works good for me.
[13.03.25, 15:51:33] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys.

Mind sharing what are some effective ways you found to get customers to buy 2+ units instead of one? 

We’re A/B testing a buy 2 get 2, buy 3 get 3 offer compared to our usual discount checkout (funnelish) and it’s overall not performing as well as the main one, although priced better
[13.03.25, 16:03:20] ~ Charles: Free shipping, free gifts, $X gift card etc.. can help
[13.03.25, 16:06:50] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yup

Nothing crazy but i got this from peter kill’s course ( we have the same offer btw 1x 2x 3x) AOV was 70 now its 140$ 

We STOPPED showing the product as a 1 piece in every ad and every image in the landing page every product scene is a bundle of 3 , when we talk about the product we talk about it as a bundle « these pillows are.. these idk what are … » 

Also we use OCU there is a flow for everyone who buys 1 or 2 we give them a deal to add 1 more to his order ( its muuuuch better than sending emails after u already shipped the product )
[13.03.25, 16:07:00] ~ Molka Sghaier: Tried all the CRO hacks from twitter and worked with the best CRO agency out there i dont wanna name names but they didnt do anything for our AOV . We tried all them CRO havks in the offer section and cart they drop cvr down and they ruin everything xd (at least thats what happened to us ). The only thing u can do is to make ur customers believe that there is no option for a 1piece  purchase. Everyone is buying 3 and the marketing team should believe this too ✌🏼
[13.03.25, 16:08:07] ~ Molka Sghaier: tbh we tested them and none if these improved AOV significantly
[13.03.25, 16:09:10] ~ Guy Edan: Good ideas. Do you know how to do free gifts on Funnelish?  doesn’t seem like there’s a straight forward way to do it
[13.03.25, 16:10:39] ~ Guy Edan: That’s interesting. I’ll look into testing that. Thanks!
‎[13.03.25, 16:12:16] ~ Felix: ‎image omitted
[13.03.25, 16:15:20] ~ Matt: Can you link the course please?

[13.03.25, 16:19:57] ~ Guy Edan: Interesting. thank u

[13.03.25, 17:42:10] ~ Bazeed: For guys using shopify here, what is the best way to send checkout abondonment emails/sms to customers apart from klaviyo (klaviyo dosent usually send emails like funnelish unless they opt in which sucks)
[13.03.25, 17:46:42] ~ Gustavo Drumm: really good tip. did the conversions changed?
[13.03.25, 17:55:48] ~ Simeon Petrov: Hey man, Abandoned checkout flow is triggered by “started checkout” event in Klaviyo. This means that as soon as a contact goes to checkout, enters their email, the event has been triggered, so they will receive an abandoned checkout email. (People who haven’t opted in through a pop-up let’s say, will also receive the Abandoned Checkout email).

If you are looking for alternative to Klaviyo try:

Omnisend: Cheaper and very decent in terms of functionality.

Yotpo: Very close to Klaviyo in terms of features and you only pay for the amount of emails you send.
[13.03.25, 18:01:34] ~ Molka Sghaier: Nope it stayed the same but AOV increased
[13.03.25, 18:02:06] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yup pls dm me on this
[13.03.25, 18:14:38] ~ Bazeed: oh makes sense, thank you, i saw klaviyo sending few emails on abandoned checkout but didn’t realise klaviyo was doing that for all

means i need to improve my flow and keep following up👍
[13.03.25, 18:19:09] ~ Simeon Petrov: Dm me, will send you our Ac flow structure

[13.03.25, 19:28:46] ~ K: +1 on that note
[13.03.25, 21:15:32] ~ Tom: Some people go as far as naming the 1x as “sample”, to give you the feeling of needing more than 1 ‎<This message was edited>
[13.03.25, 21:43:41] ~ Molka Sghaier: Idk rbh those tricks didnt work in our brand
[13.03.25, 21:58:51] ~ Al: Show your highest bundle first and smallest last ‎<This message was edited>
[13.03.25, 22:00:33] ~ Al: 100% agree with showing your biggest bundle across all marketing. Even your product reviews on the pdp
[13.03.25, 22:02:21] ~ Al: Careful bc this sounds like a limiting belief. There are a lot of CRO strategies that will work and will increase everything - CVR, AOV, Rev/session and Profit/session
[13.03.25, 22:02:40] ~ Al: Keep an open mind and keep testing
[13.03.25, 22:03:07] ~ Bryan T: I assume this is worth testing with any items you sell multiple of? Our best seller isn't consumable but customers frequently purchase 2
[13.03.25, 22:05:39] Carlos Leeseman: Have you guys tested not selling the main product alone in your AD/VSL, but as a full bundle, including the “bonus” products? So as a kind of complete package? Where you emphasize that you need all the products so that they work together with each other, achieving desired outcome only then or faster then only using the main product?
[13.03.25, 22:06:02] Carlos Leeseman: I tested it once, this did not run well for us. But am curious how this works for others
[13.03.25, 22:28:30] ~ Molka Sghaier: Ur right ill keep testing 💪🏼💪🏼altho we hired the best cro agencies in the game and 0 results the only results we saw in cvr was a full copy optimization for the whole landing page and for  AOV the only thing that really worked and is still working untill this day is the thing i shared here .


(Btw i love the CRO agency we partnered with and i dont think that there is anything wrong with them they tried their best and idk why but sometimes things dont work 😅)
[13.03.25, 22:29:29] ~ Molka Sghaier: Same .
[13.03.25, 22:32:21] ~ Caesar: if ur running VSLs on FB, try AOV closes - program the mind of your customers to always buy multiple by always showing multiple throughout the VSL as well, works super well for us (just read ur msg above that ur alreay doing this, but yeah try AOV closes as well) ‎<This message was edited>
[13.03.25, 22:32:59] ~ Omar: Nooro use to do it well
[13.03.25, 22:33:01] ~ Omar: On the end
[13.03.25, 22:33:12] ~ Caesar: yep
[13.03.25, 22:42:48] ~ Molka Sghaier: Tried xd didnt work but our vsls are not that long its like 3mn long maximum
[13.03.25, 22:43:19] ~ Molka Sghaier: Peter kill shared those in his course
[13.03.25, 22:44:33] ~ Caesar: yeah exactly, for us we always use the AOV closes since our VSLs are mega long front-end, but for a 3min VSL im not sure how a several minute long AOV close would perform

did you test it only on one VSL or all your top performers? maybe test until you find an AOV close that works, then test that on all your top performing VSLs? could even implement it into an UGC creator-style video if you are creative with it for sure
[13.03.25, 22:45:23] ~ Ben Mansour: For us what helped our aov, is a small note in the buy box on why people should buy more devices
[13.03.25, 23:40:20] ~ Gideon: Ive set up a flow for abandoned at to cart flow and browse abandonment as well. But this is only for subscribers aka existing customers
[14.03.25, 1:33:36] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Never used adspy but heard a lot about it. Is it different than gethookd and worth it or does it do the same?
‎[14.03.25, 7:42:14] ~ Bazeed: ‎image omitted
[14.03.25, 8:24:55] ~ Simeon Petrov: One is not better than the other. They just track different activities on your website. Shopify doesn’t have active on site and and viewed product metrics but they are automatically added by Klaviyo once you make the integration with it.

The only similar metric between API and Shopify is the Added-to-Cart, and the difference is that the Added-to-Cart API needs to be added by you manually in the back end while the other one is automatically added once you integrated Klaviyo with Shopify along with the other new custom events.

Although some say that Added-to-Cart Shopify also works when you add products using quick add in collection pages for some store. While added-to-cart API doesn’t and only works in the product pages.
[14.03.25, 8:27:00] ~ Bazeed: Perfect makes sense, thank you
[14.03.25, 14:25:48] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey I need a help, anybody can refer me a good packaging designer for supplements niche rq
[14.03.25, 16:37:15] ~ Charles: Hey guys, I had some issues with my credit card as a payment method for Facebook, but I resolved it with my company and added it back. After that, my ads started spending again for a short time, then suddenly stopped, then resumed briefly, and now they’ve completely stalled again for no apparent reason. 

Right now, they’re spending little to no money. I tried changing payment method with some cards that I know work for sure that I use in the past, bumped budget, prepaid some credits nothing.. All my ads are active and showing as "delivering," so I have no idea what’s causing this and I do not have any error message. Support is more than useless, tried 3 times. It’s been 24h.

Any insights or similar experiences? ‎<This message was edited>

[14.03.25, 16:43:15] ~ Matt: Hi guys what are your thoughts to this issue for new acc:
Spend was at target for 2 weeks and then was increased by 20% to 150 a day in campaign budget. Following week performance drops and CPA goes x 3. Has happened like 3 times at exact same level. 

I’m wondering if it’s the acc or if anyone else has seen that but I don’t see why it consistently drops with such small spend and literally when increasing it above 150 a day. Any ideas? I’m thinking of just starting another acc now

A lot of you guys have asked me about the design agency that did one of our websites (https://99jersey.com/). They are actually an eCom branding agency called Project Human (https://www.project-human.com/). Couldn’t recommend them enough. Could safely say that their work almost doubled our CVR. Happy to make an intro
[15.03.25, 23:30:21] ~ Ben Mansour: I‘m wondering, what‘s your winner rate when testing video ads? From how many scripts you test, one takes off?
[15.03.25, 23:34:34] ~ Fabian: Have someone tried highspending power or campaigns spending on certain times with scaling CBOs

Like morning to lunchtime 

If you have tried this, do you prefer cbo campaigns like this or just normal spending
[16.03.25, 0:23:41] ~ Molka Sghaier: In my opinion it depends on how old the brand is i feel like when it gets older the hit rate drops idk ..

When we first launched we get 3 out of 5 winners now its more of a 3 out of 7 if were lucky (its a 5 year old brand )
[16.03.25, 5:55:35] Topi: Measure every week production x win rate

The more you test, the smaller the win tate will be, but the more winners you’ll find

Find your sweetspot by looking at creatives tested x win rate x actual money made

[16.03.25, 21:10:01] ~ Zsombor: @⁨~Jeremy Khattar⁩ Can I dm you brother? I have a question regarding FB.
[16.03.25, 21:40:00] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Shoot them over @⁨~Zsombor⁩
[16.03.25, 22:27:01] ~ Molka Sghaier: Hi guys who has an invite code to Manus.ai ( or knows someone who has it )
[16.03.25, 23:29:16] Carlos Leeseman: Anyone here has a list of great American UGC creators? 40+
[16.03.25, 23:39:50] ~ Mo: Interested too ! Also for DE, NL & FR ‎<This message was edited>
[16.03.25, 23:46:26] ~ Aaron Ware: Why don’t we create a Google sheet and everyone adds 5 creators to it
[16.03.25, 23:50:52] ~ Ben Mansour: Also interested
[17.03.25, 0:43:20] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yeah lets do that it would be cool !
[17.03.25, 0:43:35] ~ Molka Sghaier: (I have some 65+ creators for 🇺🇸)

[17.03.25, 8:18:55] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: WeTracked
[17.03.25, 8:23:15] ~ Michael: Someone ever went to China for product research? If yes, where are the best places to go to?
[17.03.25, 8:25:42] Topi: Yes, china like 5 times

Canton fair maybe but its 90% iterations of old winners

You can visit 3PLs and see ”oh thats selling and thats selling”

When you visit factories you can ask their catalogs or insights if something is right now flying off the shelves

But you dont need to go to china for this. All this information is available comfortable at home ‎<This message was edited>
[17.03.25, 8:30:41] ~ Mithiran: We currently make our videos in 1080x1350 (4:5) Does anyone find a performance increase by switching it to 9:16 for reels?
[17.03.25, 8:31:23] ~ A: Has anyone here ever built schools in 3rd world countries, pls msg me
[17.03.25, 8:31:35] ~ Michael: We do 9:16 by default and it crops to 4:5 on feed. So make your the text is in the 4:5 zone
[17.03.25, 8:34:50] ~ Mithiran: Have you tested whether there's a performance increase in reels with this?
[17.03.25, 8:36:20] ~ Michael: Never checked it but I guess so. Would just do it in 9:16 I mean there's no disadvantage doing it like that
[17.03.25, 8:36:43] ~ Mithiran: Okay yeah fair enough

[17.03.25, 14:13:13] ~ Alexander Sundström: Thank you!
[17.03.25, 14:45:47] ~ Mat: Who here uses flexible ads in meta? How can you see which ad  has the best performance?
[17.03.25, 14:49:01] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: No logical way, I was asking this question around alot but what u can do is go to your winner flexible ads and see the best engagement post, the one with most engagement is the one spending most usually and it is the winner. I tried and didn't find any other way around it.
[17.03.25, 16:34:24] ~ Markus: Hi champs! Does anyone know how to work around the U.S. company registration requirement to get TikTok Shop for EU companies? We have a company in Finland, and 95% of our sales come from the U.S. We'd love to test TikTok Shop in the States, but setting up a U.S. LLC has been our bottleneck so far...
[17.03.25, 16:44:22] ~ Mat: Okay!
[17.03.25, 16:57:48] ~ Mo: Looking for affordable QR code solutions ( QR code that customers scan to get access to  “how to use guides” , discount codes etc…) tried one before but it was super expensive . thanks fam
[17.03.25, 17:03:00] ~ Rick: canva?
[17.03.25, 17:03:03] ~ Rick: i use it
[17.03.25, 17:03:07] ~ Rick: easy and simple
[17.03.25, 17:03:10] ~ Rick: always work
[17.03.25, 17:04:00] ~ Rick: you'll track all on the shopify analytics by link
[17.03.25, 17:49:15] ~ Guy Edan: Do you use Flexible ads to test 2-3 variations of an ad, or you just do 2-3 within one ad set and whatever takes spend is the winner? What works better from ur experience?
[17.03.25, 17:51:12] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey guys I need a advice, do y'all recommend getting engagement like comments on the meta ad from those agency plugs? 
Also let me have a plug for it too thanks.
[17.03.25, 17:58:49] ~ Jeremy Khattar: we’ve seen it help performance for sure @⁨~Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari⁩ - happy to connect you with our guys
[17.03.25, 17:59:06] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Dmed you bro
[17.03.25, 18:04:39] ~ Mo: will def check it out brother thank you
[17.03.25, 18:53:14] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hi Guys, what do you do when you test ads in a CBO and 70% of the budget gets allocated to the winner but you see that the second best performer actually has potential too? Do you make a separate CBO for this ad too?
[17.03.25, 18:55:34] ~ Ben Mansour: Put a minimum spend on it
[17.03.25, 19:18:17] ~ Aman: Not wise to look at individual ads as having potential. The campaign works together to achieve an overall ROAS. For example, those spending a lot are doing so for a reason, those spending less are doing the same. All to ensure the overall ROAS in the campaign is as efficient as possible.
[17.03.25, 19:18:53] ~ Aman: Same applies to keeping a low amount of campaigns in the account so meta can optimise on an account level so that over all ROAS in the account is as efficient as possible.
[17.03.25, 19:19:22] ~ Aman: Forcing spend is a waste of time since Meta is allocating exactly where it knows it will he the best results overall.
[17.03.25, 19:19:50] ~ Nikola Petkov: That's wise, thank you mate
[17.03.25, 22:50:46] ~ Jonny: ‎This message was deleted.

[17.03.25, 23:29:46] ~ Marlon Martinez: has anybody here worked with https://supliful.com/?
[18.03.25, 0:33:05] ~ Mat: Anybody here that has a good sms marketing shopify app to recommend? To retrieve abandoned carts?
[18.03.25, 0:35:31] ~ Phil: SMSgo
[18.03.25, 0:35:33] ~ Phil: It’s not bad
[18.03.25, 7:36:52] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey fellas, anyone know what could cause my ad account to just stop spending completely after running for around a year flawless with no restrictions spending around 1 - 5k per day consistently. I cant see any restrictions or errors and no problems with billing. TIA
[18.03.25, 7:38:22] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Seems this is happening a lot recently brother Mason, ping me let me see what we can do with our reps here
[18.03.25, 8:18:41] ~ Rustam: contact support, they almost immediately fixed it for me last time it happened
[18.03.25, 8:49:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah what you need
[18.03.25, 8:54:16] ~ OB: hey fellas, a scumbag is litterally using our brand name on one of his landing pages, we submitted a DMCA right away after finding out about this but Shopify is acting up and they're not making it easy for us to shut him down, any advice would be much appreciated
[18.03.25, 8:54:46] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Lawyer
[18.03.25, 8:54:51] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Cease and desist letter
[18.03.25, 8:55:10] ~ OB: anyone you can recommend bro?
[18.03.25, 8:55:29] Topi: sent
[18.03.25, 8:55:40] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Go on upwork and look for one that has made a shit ton of money there
[18.03.25, 9:02:12] ~ OB: appreciate your help guys, unbelievable that Shopify lets this sort of thing slide and not take the appropriate action immediately. They kept asking send us a link of this and that when it is the most blatant type of copyright infringement as if they are trying to protect the scumbag stealing our brand name and not us.
[18.03.25, 9:50:23] ~ Jonas M. Arnold: Tbf, people also complain if Shopify is too invasive (i.e. by exploiting the DMCA feature).
I rather have Shopify not act and thus also run into a lower risk of getting a DMCA-strike because somebody is doing BH methods on our store than Shopify being too overprotective.
[18.03.25, 9:50:50] ~ Musawer: Anyone work with good influencer marketing agency or someone who handle all things? Dm me please
[18.03.25, 9:57:15] ~ Marlon Martinez: Looking for good ondemand supplemt suppliers
[18.03.25, 9:57:48] ~ Alvaro De Prada: They are not bad to start.
[18.03.25, 9:57:53] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can also see Printify
[18.03.25, 9:58:09] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can see their supplier which is Rocket something
[18.03.25, 9:58:36] ~ Alvaro De Prada: And you can sign up through their website, they have a ton of supplements
[18.03.25, 10:02:02] ~ Alvaro De Prada: DMCA on Shopify/Facebook is not to protect merchants/copyright holders but to protect Shopify itself.

You can actually sue Shopify if they shut down your product/page due to an incorrect DMCA. But they let DMCA’s in because they can sue (with you) the person that did the DMCA in the first place.

But yeah, if you get a DMCA notice make sure you counter it. Is the only way to not make it count towards their 3 strike policy.

If you get 3 DMCA’s they close your store
[18.03.25, 10:03:07] ~ Marlon Martinez: Thanks!
[18.03.25, 10:06:49] ~ Jonas M. Arnold: Yes - but that's my point. No matter how Shopify handles it (too aggressive on DMCA or too loose) they stand to be hated on this topic.
[18.03.25, 10:27:03] ~ Filippo: jetpackshipping.com should be a US supplement manufacturer for a well known moringa brand ‎<This message was edited>

[18.03.25, 16:25:02] ~ Alexander Sundström: what metrics do you mainly look at in triple whale to make decisions? TI, TA, TA+V?
[18.03.25, 16:27:30] ~ Cocow😈: If meta they advise to check TA+V. I still prefer using meta ads manager because it is easier

[18.03.25, 18:58:08] ~ Filippo: dont have a plug but u can either build up credit in US to apply for amex or go through the global transfer program

[19.03.25, 17:11:04] Fabian: Often decreases conversion rate
[19.03.25, 17:11:20] ~ Rick: depends, i use it when they scroll till 80% of the page
[19.03.25, 17:11:34] ~ Cocow😈: It is like having and ad on middle of a YouTube vidéo ‎<This message was edited>
[19.03.25, 17:11:37] ~ Rick: it pop up with the "final offer"
[19.03.25, 17:11:38] ~ Cocow😈: 🤣
[19.03.25, 17:12:07] ~ Rick: i'ts like a reminder of the offer
[19.03.25, 17:12:41] ~ Cocow😈: At the mastermind they were telling this is not optimal on funnels but why , do not know
[19.03.25, 17:13:06] ~ Rick: the only way to see if it works
[19.03.25, 17:13:09] ~ Rick: is test it
[19.03.25, 17:13:33] ~ Mithiran: wow great idea did u split test?
[19.03.25, 17:13:48] ~ Rick: yes and it convert more
[19.03.25, 17:14:17] ~ Mithiran: did you know the % increase by chance?
[19.03.25, 17:14:34] ~ Rick: it's a really simple pop up, with the offer explained better, discount and bonus side
[19.03.25, 17:15:11] ~ Rick: RPV from like 4 to 5
[19.03.25, 17:18:40] ~ Musawer: Do you guys use popup for collecting email on funnels?
[19.03.25, 17:18:58] ~ Musawer: For example giving discount
[19.03.25, 17:21:15] ~ Rick: on funnelish not
[19.03.25, 17:21:40] ~ Rick: on shopify yes, we offer a discount or a mistery gift
[19.03.25, 17:22:03] ~ Charles: Anyone have a great strategy to increase recurring customer?
[19.03.25, 17:22:51] ~ Musawer: Because i heard someone making 300k a month after using popup to collect email and with email marketing they made 700k per month
[19.03.25, 17:23:11] ~ Rick: yes bro
[19.03.25, 17:23:20] ~ Rick: if you have a good optin rate
[19.03.25, 17:23:23] ~ Rick: is gold
[19.03.25, 17:23:51] Topi: its not that simple, this sounds very guru miracle story and most likely lots of details are left out
‎[19.03.25, 17:24:08] ~ Mike Ramsey: ‎image omitted
[19.03.25, 17:24:20] Topi: overall popup reduces your conversion but with strong email marketing sometimes lead can be more important
[19.03.25, 17:24:58] ~ Rick: depends where i'ts pop up, and when, and how is made
[19.03.25, 17:25:14] ~ Rick: for us it doesn't reduce the CR
[19.03.25, 17:26:39] ~ Musawer: How is you guys email open rates and click rate
[19.03.25, 17:34:30] ~ Caesar: exactly
[19.03.25, 17:35:13] ~ Caesar: source:

trust me bro
[19.03.25, 17:58:21] ~ Simeon Petrov: I’ve watched 3 courses on pop-ups from pop-up tool creators so here’s the summary so you don’t have to 😄:

1. If you run cold traffic to funnel then don’t show an email collection pop-up. More often than note it will decrease cvr. (Optional to show it with the condition being a deep scroll on the page like 70-80%

2. If you run cold traffic to product page on shopify, set the time delay of the pop-up to at least 25s-45s or exit intent only if you want to be on the safer side. (You can A/B test this and see how different time delays impact your cvr to determine what works for your brand)
3. ⁠On Shopify homepage you can go more agressive with an 8s time delay. People there are not actively educating themselves about a specific product or making a purchasing descision on the spot.

To sum it up:

On funnels - no pop-up or deep scroll

On product/collections pages on shopify- longer time delays or exit intent only

On home page - 8-15s (won’t affect cvr)
[19.03.25, 18:03:44] ~ Bazeed: exactly 💯 i do the 40s method for product page, so people who are going to buy do it quick anyway and dont get bothered 

the ones that might be sceptical or might scroll around get the pop-up and that incentives them, even more to take action

[19.03.25, 22:00:05] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Received this while just after I received a email to submit documents and I was about to submit it, it's a new brand but I have my own custom stock, any advice if anybody have faced this please let me know. 🙏🏻
[19.03.25, 22:07:12] ~ Fabian: Happend to me, Shopify never answered me. I moved on, never used Shopify Payments again. Shopify is more sensetive when you use Shopify Payments. Also i work under a new Company, and a new shopify account.
[19.03.25, 22:07:41] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Can I dm you bro?
[19.03.25, 22:08:49] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Also do you think they are gonna pay my payouts

[19.03.25, 22:22:53] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Just asked to support and they said I can still dispute the account close further regardless. Please let me know guys if any advices 🙏🏻
[19.03.25, 22:22:57] ~ Fabian: Yes they will pay you after 120 Days, but they will not let you see your orders so you will not be able to deliver your current orders
[19.03.25, 22:23:19] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: So the customers get scammed bro?
[19.03.25, 22:23:24] ~ Fabian: yes
[19.03.25, 22:23:32] ~ Fabian: the ones that you have not delivered
[19.03.25, 22:23:36] ~ Fabian: too yet
[19.03.25, 22:24:27] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I have a form received from Shopify and the support told me to fill it and open a dispute through emails do u think it's worth it?
[19.03.25, 22:24:42] ~ Fabian: sure you can try
[19.03.25, 22:25:02] ~ Fabian: they never answered me tho, i wish i just moved on faster instead of waiting for them
[19.03.25, 22:25:07] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I have 3 brands running my product 10-20k days on Shopify so it's definitely not my peoducy.
[19.03.25, 22:25:14] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Bro what are you using now?
[19.03.25, 22:25:20] ~ Fabian: you can look up people in the Community forum having the same problem, they never got any answer too
[19.03.25, 22:25:44] ~ Fabian: Shopify but never sign up to Shopify Payments, then i use airwallex
[19.03.25, 22:25:47] ~ Fabian: for payments
[19.03.25, 22:26:39] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: AIRWALLEX any country or you prefer HK only?
[19.03.25, 22:27:02] ~ Fabian: I feel sorry for you, i do not trust shopify a bit. Thats why i split the risk, domain on 1 platform, 1 platform for payments etc
[19.03.25, 22:27:15] ~ Fabian: I dont know, i use HK tho
[19.03.25, 22:27:47] ~ Mikael: I got this shit when Klarna was banned on one store. We duplicated the store but got terminated 3 times each time when we activated shopify payments
[19.03.25, 22:28:34] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hm alright thanks bro, I'll do all the docs fillup and hope i don't get my customers scammed because I have that brand name on my product and got it up with alot of hopes and months of hard work.
[19.03.25, 22:29:49] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: So do you think if i got lucky and got the store up just never use Shopify payments again and also divide the risk?
[19.03.25, 22:30:32] ~ Mikael: For us it seemed like if we did not activate shopify payments it did not get terminated
[19.03.25, 22:31:55] ~ UHO: Sad, but you’ll never getting that back. You should move on. Nobody I know ever got it back.
[19.03.25, 22:32:57] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I know many people buying IBOs and noshipping on Shopify payments and getting away very easily. I feel it's just the legit businesses which always suffer
[19.03.25, 22:48:53] ~ Rick: Yo Dark Lords. The FB profile of my CMO suddenly got restricted out of nowhere. There is no option to request a review. What do you suggest doing?
[19.03.25, 22:50:30] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Yoo guys, when testing VSL’s, do you see better performance with ADV+?
[19.03.25, 23:17:45] ~ Mo: Happened to me. Create a new store with different company, bank account, everything new
[19.03.25, 23:23:42] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Do u think doing the same product with new brand name would be fine or should I just forget the current product with Shopify payments? Just applied for a HK LLC should get it by saturday.
[19.03.25, 23:39:57] ~ Mo: @⁨~Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari⁩ just dmed u
[20.03.25, 1:07:36] ~ Fabian: Do someone have a contact to buy Facebook pages, verified or with followers
[20.03.25, 2:13:26] ~ Christian: Hey guys, when you work with UGC creators, do you just get raw content and give that to a video editor or do you let them to edit the video too?
[20.03.25, 5:05:20] ~ Aaron Ware: Raw so then you can mix and match forever.
[20.03.25, 5:05:58] ~ Aaron Ware: Does anyone have a contact to get really high quality product photo/videos
[20.03.25, 5:45:59] ~ Pramesh: can anyone recommend good plug for fb setup?
[20.03.25, 5:46:01] ~ Pramesh: my personal one got cooked
[20.03.25, 5:46:58] ~ Pramesh: I always tell them raw cause it's easier for them and u can mention that to negotiate price down
[20.03.25, 10:39:07] ~ Loic: You mean Facebook profil + BM? or Ad account?
[20.03.25, 10:46:32] ~ Filippo: Heard Airwallex is not good for US because of high declines
[20.03.25, 11:02:42] ~ Antonio Celani: @misterfacebook is use on telegram
[20.03.25, 11:27:00] ~ Fabian: yes, bad accept rate compared to stripe ‎<This message was edited>
[20.03.25, 11:28:30] ~ Rick: anyone have good tips on how to increase AOV? 
i have all already set for my brand
- upsell 
- post purchase
[20.03.25, 11:29:20] ~ Rick: but i want to reach at least an 80/90$ AOV, now i'm at 61$, in q4 i'm like 72$
[20.03.25, 11:29:36] ~ Rick: anyone?
[20.03.25, 11:30:28] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yes pls search aov ull find a long msg i sent weeks ago

[20.03.25, 11:31:52] ~ Rick: oh i remember yes
[20.03.25, 11:31:59] ~ Rick: let me find it
[20.03.25, 11:33:37] ~ Rick: this right?
[20.03.25, 11:36:27] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yupp
[20.03.25, 11:36:50] ~ Rick: yes but it doesn't fit with my product
[20.03.25, 11:37:32] ~ Molka Sghaier: Humm.. so u can only sell 1 unit of it right?
[20.03.25, 11:38:24] ~ Molka Sghaier: Nobody ever bought 2 ? Like maybe as a gift to their friends or family
[20.03.25, 11:40:33] ~ Rick: yes they buy on average 2 pcs
[20.03.25, 11:40:44] ~ Rick: i sell till 4 pcs
[20.03.25, 11:41:28] ~ Rick: i'm gonna test, your strategie
[20.03.25, 11:41:50] ~ Rick: you do the ad as well with already the "quantity bundle" inside?
[20.03.25, 11:42:04] ~ Rick: and the product page as well right?
[20.03.25, 11:44:45] ~ Molka Sghaier: Then why cant u do it xd
[20.03.25, 11:45:11] ~ Rick: my bad i'm tripping
[20.03.25, 11:45:12] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yes thats how u market the product , as a bundle
[20.03.25, 11:45:51] ~ Rick: many thanks molka
[20.03.25, 11:45:53] ~ Molka Sghaier: But ofc u should leave them the option the get 1 if thats what they want
[20.03.25, 11:46:01] ~ Molka Sghaier: (in the lp)
[20.03.25, 11:46:40] ~ Rick: ok but it have to appear like the worst decision they can made, right? in terms of quantity, and price offer
[20.03.25, 11:46:50] ~ Molka Sghaier: Exactly
[20.03.25, 11:46:59] ~ Molka Sghaier: In the ads and adv
[20.03.25, 11:47:13] ~ Molka Sghaier: But in the landing page or iffer page dont push too much
[20.03.25, 11:47:24] ~ Molka Sghaier: At least thats what worked for us
[20.03.25, 11:47:38] ~ Rick: in what part of the ad you suggest to add it? on the lead, or on the body? ‎<This message was edited>
[20.03.25, 11:47:56] ~ Rick: ok, only present it better on quantity
[20.03.25, 11:48:20] ~ Filippo: look up MiamiMD
[20.03.25, 11:48:53] ~ Molka Sghaier: Ur not gonna add it actually u will just reffer to the produxt as “these” instead of “this” in the whole ad
[20.03.25, 11:49:11] ~ Rick: yes bro i know
[20.03.25, 11:49:17] ~ Growg: So Here is quick Fundamentals 
To increase AOV by roughly 10-20% 

Consider following things
1. Test Bundle Funnel 
2. ⁠Understand you unit economics and pricing, test what is the break price for your buyer i.e at which point fricition is there. 
Ex - If you are selling currently at $49, increase the price by a 1$ and simultaneously check at which point it breaks . 
3. Post purchase should be dynamic.

Most of the time you need to understand economics and than strategies it

Notes- All this startegy was suggested by my CRO expert & they have executed it. ‎<This message was edited>
[20.03.25, 11:49:17] ~ Rick: i'ts different
[20.03.25, 11:49:18] ~ Molka Sghaier: So that people perceive it as a bundle from the start to the end
[20.03.25, 11:50:06] ~ Rick: copy persuasion to quantity
[20.03.25, 11:50:27] ~ Filippo: have u tried doing funnels?
[20.03.25, 11:50:50] ~ Rick: post purchase dynamic?? what is your % on it?
[20.03.25, 11:50:58] ~ Rick: yes
[20.03.25, 11:51:00] ~ Filippo: my last product my ctc was $60 and my aov $175
[20.03.25, 11:51:06] ~ Rick: adv, listicle, 7 reason
[20.03.25, 11:51:25] ~ Rick: still alive?
[20.03.25, 11:51:37] ~ Filippo: was a winter product
[20.03.25, 11:51:59] ~ Filippo: but people needed more units of it, easy to sell more ‎<This message was edited>

[20.03.25, 11:54:45] ~ Molka Sghaier: Shopify
[20.03.25, 11:54:51] ~ Rick: hit
[20.03.25, 11:54:54] ~ Filippo: if you want repeated customers high AOV is not always good
[20.03.25, 11:54:59] ~ Rick: i'm gonna test it molka
[20.03.25, 11:55:04] ~ Rick: i'll let u know
[20.03.25, 11:55:09] ~ Molka Sghaier: We cant have repeated customers xd

[20.03.25, 21:53:58] ~ Davide: What would you do guys if you launched an ad and almost immediately took a big part of the ad account’s spending on FB but it didn’t respect the KPI? (Low CR)
[20.03.25, 21:55:14] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I did put a spend limit on it for 40$ last time and waited for the kpi to get better, in three days it was around my targeted cpa
[20.03.25, 22:10:50] ~ Filippo: Someone is using klarna for us market? Is it worth to have it?

[21.03.25, 0:13:16] ~ LC: Anyone know a way around getting False DMCA's? This guy is using Bustem Agency and been on our ass, product isn't patented/trademarked, not using any of his content and shopify are taking the piss
[21.03.25, 0:14:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Lawyer
[21.03.25, 0:54:48] ~ Bryan T: Hit him with a cease and desist, one of my stores had that happen a few times, wrote them a cease and desist and they’ve left us alone for years.

[21.03.25, 10:48:36] ~ Giuliano: Hey guys do the visitor numbers and CR on your shopify dashboard match the data of your ads ?

*or has a list with top notch ugc creators?*

[21.03.25, 13:18:43] ~ Brandon: we use sweetspot.video a lot. ‎<This message was edited>
[21.03.25, 13:25:38] ~ Daniel: This a bit more work, but you can create your own list with this (and most likely way cheaper):

Join German UGC Facebook groups and create a post saying you’re looking for creators. Your inbox will be flooded with creators within 5 hours

Join groups like ‘’UGC Deutschland’’ ‘’UGC Germany’’ ‘’Schauspieler Deutschland’’ and variations on this. 

Check which recent job posts have the most engagement and use that style for your own post
[21.03.25, 13:26:21] ~ Arad Khazabi: Thanks!

[21.03.25, 15:53:08] ~ Matthew Martorano: Just read this. It seems like there’s software creating these DMCA’s now: https://x.com/atyxcv/status/1902796240821055700?s=46
[21.03.25, 15:53:42] ~ Filippo: maybe only way is swithing to a diff platform, no shopify
[21.03.25, 15:55:00] ~ LC: cheers let me take a look
[21.03.25, 15:55:45] ~ Ryan Leven: Use Checkout Champ, you don’t own your business if you’re still on Shopify
[21.03.25, 16:29:29] ~ Mithiran: Does anyone have an SOP for surf scaling?
[21.03.25, 16:30:17] ~ Growg: DMed you bro
[22.03.25, 12:17:03] ~ Alexander Sundström: does anyone know a way to ask for a review on a Klarna dispute that has become a chargeback through shopify payments? We win every dispute and we provide the exact same evidence every time, but this time we lost. Shopify tells me to contact Klarna and Klarna tells me to contact Shopify and they can not help me once the decision is made regarding the chargeback. We tried to escalate this to the right department on shopify, but they say it is not possible since the decision is made by Klarna and the "bank". Anyone knows how to win this?
[22.03.25, 13:13:11] ~ Nicolò: Does anyone know how to block scam pages under ads comments where they spam scam sites of your product?
[22.03.25, 13:26:32] ~ K: blacklist certain words they always use like: cheaper, other site etc
[22.03.25, 13:26:50] ~ Nicolò: he put only the scam link
[22.03.25, 13:29:47] ~ K: block .com or something that every domain has
[22.03.25, 13:33:37] ~ OB: how do you win every dispute; what kind of "same evidence" do you provide if you don't mind?
[22.03.25, 13:59:24] ~ Alexander Sundström: ‎This message was deleted.
[22.03.25, 13:59:46] ~ Alexander Sundström: every order that says goods_not_delivered and faulty_goods. we provide proof of delivery that is line with klarnas policy and for faulty goods we always send a new one and provide the proof of delivery for the new product
[22.03.25, 15:40:33] ~ Mikael: Anyone have a VA to spare? Im looking for a skilled VA who can help with AI translation and building Product pages on Shopify
[22.03.25, 17:24:22] ~ Mo: guys whats best tool to compress videos ( to be hosted in pdp later) ?
[22.03.25, 21:08:52] ~ Christopher Murphy: Anyone know any tools where I can bulk upload ads to meta?

[22.03.25, 22:59:53] ~ Damjan Topalovic: What’s up guys
Optins on a new funnel on funnelish are not working when I hover over checkout, any ideas on fixing this?
[22.03.25, 23:05:27] ~ Felix: Looks like a custom quantity break to me, not an app
[23.03.25, 12:24:14] ~ Gordon: hello - does anyone have a facebook / instagram insider to help us take down a competitor instagram video post? thanks
[23.03.25, 12:24:32] ~ Jonas M. Arnold: yes
[23.03.25, 15:55:57] ~ Daniel: Hey guys! 

We want to create a new BM, but Meta says I have reached my limit in creating business managers. Can I just ask my employee who does Facebook Ads for us, to create a new BM and then he invites me as an admin? This won't trigger any issues with Meta? 

And this new BM would be verified with a company that has already verified another Business Manager. 

Appreciate the help in advance, I want to move carefully with Meta, making sure I don’t trigger any bans, restrictions.  😅
[23.03.25, 17:08:26] ~ Bazeed: For guys outisde usa running their store, What app are you guys using for us sim? (excluding hush)
[23.03.25, 17:22:38] ~ Nal: Vyke
[23.03.25, 17:35:08] ~ Ben Mansour: No it‘s all fine
[23.03.25, 17:37:16] ~ Zsombor: +1 for vyke

[23.03.25, 22:22:37] ~ Mo: Can I build an advertorial on shopify ( gempages for exp ) then redirect it to funnelish sales page for the rest of the funnel, is this doable ? ( just wanna test the adv first on gempages before building it on funnelish)
[23.03.25, 22:25:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yes it is doable
[23.03.25, 22:25:05] ~ Damjan Topalovic: i dont think thats possible - what’s the difference, if you already have the advertorial done in gempages, just make the structure in funnelish and paste the copy in. shouldn’t take more then an hour
[23.03.25, 22:48:49] ~ Rick: I think tracking isnt optimal that way
[23.03.25, 23:29:35] ~ Mo: Im not that savy , i usually hire someone to build them for me. So its not that complicated ?
[23.03.25, 23:30:41] ~ Mo: Yeah & analyzing ctr in gempages…. Thats what other guys told me
[24.03.25, 0:46:13] ~ Yuanda: Does anyone know if you get an ad reported for copyright / intellectual property , does the fb page go down right away ? Or is it a warning like the DMCA ‎<This message was edited>
[24.03.25, 0:52:02] ~ Pramesh: na, it's not that complicated. Also if you already have gempage ready then you can just get someone on fiverr to copy that
[24.03.25, 0:52:07] ~ Pramesh: they will get it done in 1 hour
[24.03.25, 0:54:36] ~ Molka Sghaier: I thibk monday.com does that there is some type of automation that does that
[24.03.25, 0:55:03] ~ Molka Sghaier: Theyll go down after e few reportings
[24.03.25, 0:56:15] ~ Yuanda: Kitchn.io
[24.03.25, 0:56:34] ~ Yuanda: Full page restricted ?

[24.03.25, 1:27:56] ~ M: Nope?
[24.03.25, 1:28:13] ~ M: Unless there was a recent law change in uk or on shopifys end
[24.03.25, 1:31:48] ~ Charles: Maybe just a tracking issue
[24.03.25, 1:32:30] ~ Nico Neumann: Have the visitors only been halved based on shopifys data?
[24.03.25, 1:32:46] ~ M: Yes
[24.03.25, 1:33:00] ~ M: Let me double check google analytics would you say?
[24.03.25, 1:57:03] ~ Brandon: can anyone else recommend this?
[24.03.25, 9:22:05] ~ Antonio Celani: Hello guys I am having some issue to scale my nutra brand with paypal.

I have heard of some guys here in dubai running paypal with a Chinese factory who after taking a fee give you payout through crypto.

Does anyone have a similare contact ? If yes can you share it with me?

I would appreciate thank you 🙏
[24.03.25, 10:03:17] ~ Musawer: Any recommendations for website AB testing software

[24.03.25, 10:17:19] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yh I don't think so either but I am not fully sure
[24.03.25, 10:40:44] ~ Loic: Hello, do you have a video editor familiar with ecom ads to recommend?
[24.03.25, 11:48:31] ~ UHO: I do.
[24.03.25, 11:48:49] ~ UHO: Sending a dm.
[24.03.25, 14:53:16] ~ Nils: I'm using Airwallex, but my contact told me the best is to actually go to Hong Kong and setup an HSBC bank account
[24.03.25, 15:00:19] ~ Mo: Will do so thanks man
[24.03.25, 15:00:49] ~ Mo: U gotta be there physically u mean ?
[24.03.25, 15:15:04] ~ Nils: From the information i got yes
[24.03.25, 15:15:54] ~ Robin: That’s is correct, I got the same information
[24.03.25, 15:16:13] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yes if u r processing big money then best is to go for hsbc or citi bank by visiting there physically and I think you can go and say hi to your suppliers on the same go ‎<This message was edited>
[24.03.25, 15:17:38] ~ Mo: Yeah pretty good idea
[24.03.25, 15:25:28] ~ Daniel: Another option is work with a payment provider who does all due diligence at the start, so you don’t have the risk of getting holds/bans after doing big numbers
[24.03.25, 15:26:28] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Any you have in your mind? Specially for payment processors, i really wanna get rid of Shopify payments 😂

[24.03.25, 15:33:53] ~ Rick: anyone knows the best way to DMCA an ad on the meta? pls i have i competitors that is ripping my content and all my real reviews
[24.03.25, 15:34:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/copyrightform
[24.03.25, 15:47:15] ~ Nicolò: Does anyone have a good template for report meta ads?
[24.03.25, 15:53:41] ~ Filippo: “Once your ads are live, they belong to the game now”
[24.03.25, 15:57:51] ~ Rick: bro i have all registered with trademark
[24.03.25, 15:57:56] ~ Rick: not dropshipping type shit
[24.03.25, 15:58:25] ~ YUSUF: Has anyone used SST’s service, or you just register and file individually for each state?
[24.03.25, 15:58:26] ~ Rick: my game now is lawyer
[24.03.25, 16:01:06] ~ Rick: @⁨~Alvaro De Prada⁩ do you have some tips? un aiuto

[24.03.25, 16:01:46] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Second is BH insider
[24.03.25, 16:02:21] ~ Rick: thanks 🙏🏼
[24.03.25, 16:03:07] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If someone is truly ripping your ads (or not), blast them with DMCA’s and prepare for battle
[24.03.25, 16:05:04] ~ Rick: I would like to avoid battle, I would prefer a peaceful encounter where people are honest, but in this game it seems a mirage
[24.03.25, 16:06:26] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Not even priests are honest… unfortunately dropshippers we are all fuckers one way or another… unless the law becomes more hardcore on the type of shit we can get away with, it will only get worse.

As of today you can destroy a business with 2 insiders and 10k
[24.03.25, 16:06:59] ~ Alvaro De Prada: So, even if you are on the right, prepare for battle
[24.03.25, 16:07:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I had someone copy me entirely and dmca me via fb and Shopify
[24.03.25, 16:07:21] ~ Rick: even if im fully registered with trademark and on amazon as well?
[24.03.25, 16:07:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeap…. You can still get shutdown
[24.03.25, 16:07:47] ~ Rick: crazy shit, only in shopify
[24.03.25, 16:08:01] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Worse damage was through fb honestly
[24.03.25, 16:08:13] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Shopify is pretty easy to get it back up
[24.03.25, 16:08:19] ~ Filippo: How do you prepare for this?
[24.03.25, 16:08:32] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Just send counter notices and it removes it
[24.03.25, 16:08:51] ~ Rick: I will start contacting him by e-mail to proceed with a peaceful negotiation, let's see
[24.03.25, 16:08:54] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can’t. If someone wants to bring you down, they can
[24.03.25, 16:09:27] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can get a lawyer to send a C&D letter
[24.03.25, 16:09:42] ~ Rick: yes i'm doing it
[24.03.25, 16:10:14] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Also, if you send 3 DMCA to their ads, the page gets deleted + their profile enters a 30-day deletion process
[24.03.25, 16:10:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: And they lose everything ‎<This message was edited>
[24.03.25, 16:10:31] ~ Rick: ddaaammnnn
[24.03.25, 16:11:39] ~ Rick: and if i put the trademark on the ads, will they perform worse?
[24.03.25, 16:12:02] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah… doesn’t make sense to do that
[24.03.25, 16:12:07] ~ Rick: because i don't like the trademark on the creative, seems pretty scammy
[24.03.25, 16:12:12] ~ Alvaro De Prada: As I said… if someone wants to copy you, they won’t care
[24.03.25, 16:13:10] ~ Rick: yes got it
[24.03.25, 16:13:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Just be better than them… and fuck them if they are actually copying you.

If you have an LLC and they do as well… is a pretty nice payout what you can get
[24.03.25, 16:13:43] ~ Rick: bro i'm in italy
[24.03.25, 16:13:46] ~ Rick: srl
[24.03.25, 16:14:31] ~ Zsombor: Where is your trademark registered?
[24.03.25, 16:14:43] ~ Rick: all world
[24.03.25, 16:14:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Then… go BH on him

[24.03.25, 16:15:01] ~ Zsombor: and where is his company registered?
[24.03.25, 16:15:30] ~ Rick: you still in italy?
[24.03.25, 16:15:39] ~ Rick: let me know if we can link up
[24.03.25, 16:15:41] ~ Alvaro De Prada: To be all over the world means that is accepted in EUIPO + USPTO + UKPTO and many more
[24.03.25, 16:15:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Are you sure?
[24.03.25, 16:15:52] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah until September
[24.03.25, 16:16:04] ~ Rick: WIPO?

[24.03.25, 16:17:30] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I didn’t know about WIPO 🤯
[24.03.25, 16:17:54] ~ Rick: it's little bit slow, but works good
[24.03.25, 16:18:11] ~ Alvaro De Prada: USPTO 8-11 months 🥲
[24.03.25, 16:18:24] ~ Rick: yes i know 😅

[24.03.25, 16:18:48] ~ Filippo: @⁨~Rick⁩ is the guy that ripped you pushing decent volume?
[24.03.25, 16:18:51] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I did it in July… didn’t think of Amazon 🥲
[24.03.25, 16:19:11] ~ Rick: yeah me as well, all info that comes later 🤣
[24.03.25, 16:19:18] ~ Rick: but at least it comes
[24.03.25, 16:19:40] ~ Rick: next brand will be more faster in all type of aspect
[24.03.25, 16:20:08] ~ Rick: it probably spend like 1/2k daily for me
[24.03.25, 16:20:14] ~ Rick: low for now
[24.03.25, 16:20:52] ~ Rick: but it sell on a different market from my main one, but i hate that he use my content, and my customer reviews
[24.03.25, 16:21:32] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I got people that purchased my domain.in / pk ecc so I feel you 😂
[24.03.25, 16:21:52] ~ Alvaro De Prada: They even got my packaging but ain’t purchasing from me 😂

[24.03.25, 16:23:19] ~ Guy Edan: does anyone have a welcome email flow template they can share?
[24.03.25, 16:23:50] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Twitter is your best friend here. A bunch of email guys share them
[24.03.25, 16:26:04] ~ Filippo: Do you plan on moving abroad or keep the srl?
[24.03.25, 16:26:37] ~ Rick: for now keep it and i'll open an company on the USA
[24.03.25, 16:27:10] ~ Rick: but if you do all the things white, legally, and very well made, italy is a good options for an exit
[24.03.25, 16:27:29] ~ Filippo: Italy as tax residency/ company base?
[24.03.25, 16:28:04] ~ Rick: since it is “difficult” to do business in italy, if you can do it you have an added value in the whole, also because I have office with 7 employees in house
[24.03.25, 16:28:12] ~ Rick: yes
[24.03.25, 16:28:16] ~ Rick: never been to dubai

[24.03.25, 19:11:54] ~ Zsombor: Anyone here have a company structure that involves a UAE free zone company? If so can I dm you? Thanks in advance. 🙏
[24.03.25, 19:15:17] ~ Omar: what is the best company structure in terms of saftey
[24.03.25, 19:21:06] ~ Filippo: What do you mean by “safety”?
[24.03.25, 19:21:41] ~ Omar: Like ur money is safe
[24.03.25, 19:22:53] ~ Filippo: Why wouldn’t be safe ?
[24.03.25, 19:23:05] ~ Filippo: Or maybe UAE banks shut u down easily?
[24.03.25, 19:23:11] ~ Filippo: want to understand
[24.03.25, 19:23:58] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Depends on volume but technically:

Trading companies to make money
Holding company that gets the profits
Holding company pays you
[24.03.25, 19:49:38] ~ Omar: Yes what jurisdictions for the holding companies
[24.03.25, 19:50:38] ~ Alvaro De Prada: that is better a tax advisor because it depends on where you plan to live

[24.03.25, 21:27:32] ~ OB: I run a US LLC but just came across an ad promoting Hong Kong company, does anyone have any insight about HK companies and how they compare to a US LLC for ecom?
[24.03.25, 21:37:47] ~ Zsombor: You have a uae corp? Let's talk
[24.03.25, 21:42:55] ~ Mike Ramsey: Depends on where you are selling.  Makes sense to have US LLC if high percentage of sales are in the US.  If US LLC is used for a majority of sales outside of US, that is likely going to create stability issues with the US based processor.   You want to keep high percentage of sales in the US for processors in that region.  Over 40% of sales outside of US, then it gets expensive and lots of failed transactions, performance concerns, etc.

HK has been much more flexible for businesses selling into other regions such as EU, UK, AUS.  Particularly if newer set-up and just getting warmed up.

Ideally having an entity where a bulk of your sales is the best for maximum processor stability and access to local payment methods, currency and high authorization rates. ‎<This message was edited>
[24.03.25, 21:43:32] ~ Chris Rivera: I love this answer Mike.  I agree 100%
[24.03.25, 21:44:29] ~ Mike Ramsey: Thanks @⁨~Chris Rivera⁩ 🙂
[24.03.25, 22:19:42] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Which third party payment gateway is recommended if we don't have a US business bank account to attach with Shopify payments. 

Current option I am considering is 2checkout.

But I need better alternative especially which gives faster payouts with multiple currency acceptance option so the cash flow is not affected.
[24.03.25, 23:02:21] ~ Mike Ramsey: Depends where you are located and where you are selling.  2checkout is a merchant of record solution so they are good with providing local payments methods and currency conversion in most regions but rates are steeper than other MOR’s.  Plus stricter underwriting and support is a bit suspect since they were acquired by Verifone.  If you need some recs feel free to DM.  Lots of 3rd party alternatives, just depends on your overall GTM strategy, product, requirements, volumes etc.
[24.03.25, 23:03:59] ~ OB: Appreciate your thorough answer bro

[24.03.25, 23:36:20] ~ Matthew Martorano: Can you message me on this also?
[24.03.25, 23:36:38] ~ Ryan Kamal: Yeah absoloutely
[25.03.25, 0:20:23] ~ Molka Sghaier: We use this
[25.03.25, 0:20:41] ~ Molka Sghaier: Its also great for automating media buying
[25.03.25, 1:17:07] ~ Fabian: Anyone know a brand selling products for bad memory that do VSLs?Please let me know
[25.03.25, 1:22:45] ~ Yuanda: Has anyone worked with UGC factory before
[25.03.25, 1:22:53] ~ Yuanda: Anyone have recommendations for creative  agencies
[25.03.25, 1:23:07] ~ Yuanda: Oh wow how do you use it to automate media buying? I never explored that
[25.03.25, 1:29:00] ~ Molka Sghaier: Thats actually the whole purpose of kitchen ! U make rules and u iterate on them ofc but in the end we could scale to the moon because of it ( it turns on and off ads real time ) and i think u need that in BFCM for exp
[25.03.25, 1:32:46] ~ Molka Sghaier: I dont recommend working with agencies at all😂 unless they get paid based on performance instead of milking thousands every month
[25.03.25, 1:33:13] ~ Yuanda: What about paid on % adspend
[25.03.25, 1:33:30] ~ Yuanda: I will try this for testing and scaling campaigns
[25.03.25, 1:52:14] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Anyone got contact to an insider from meta to unban an Ads Manager?
[25.03.25, 1:52:37] ~ Ryan Leven: I have someone for Unbans - it’s expensive though
[25.03.25, 1:52:55] ~ Damjan Topalovic: No worries man
[25.03.25, 1:53:07] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Send the contact straight to DM
[25.03.25, 1:53:38] ~ Ryan Leven: I don’t know if he will let me give the contact… very safe about how he does this /‘doesn’t want his name getting out
[25.03.25, 1:53:45] ~ Ryan Leven: Let me talk to him… dm me
[25.03.25, 1:54:23] ~ Damjan Topalovic: 🤝🏽
[25.03.25, 1:56:49] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yeah that would be cool if ur brand is scaling i can introduce u
[25.03.25, 1:57:22] ~ Molka Sghaier: They only work with 8fig brands cause tgeyre performance based and i actually like them they make great ads
[25.03.25, 1:59:36] ~ Molka Sghaier: I have someone too we worked with him and he is legit
[25.03.25, 2:01:49] ~ Molka Sghaier: But idk about fhis whole loop tbh i think that facebook will hate u and will ruin ur performance anyways so if its just because its a new ad acc and the peoduct is kinda aggressive i can give u a top that works with us better than unbanning
[25.03.25, 2:02:10] ~ Molka Sghaier: But if its 🎩 then u got no other choice
[25.03.25, 2:33:44] ~ Arad Khazabi: *anybody is running here a consulting business? Got a question in terms of landing pages*
[25.03.25, 3:11:38] ~ Yuanda: Can you introduce me? We are scaling now
[25.03.25, 3:11:42] ~ Yuanda: Is it creative flywheel ?
[25.03.25, 3:30:14] ~ Christian: I want to have the option in my store to have quantity discounts as well as buy x get y free. But stupid shopify cant have both at the same time, does anybody have a workaround except apps?
[25.03.25, 3:57:26] ~ Ben Mansour: Can you recommend any brands that make killer vsls with ai voiceovers so i can inspire
[25.03.25, 8:34:56] ~ Mason Schulze: for those selling supplements like gummies, what are your typical margins like. Im trying to work out how to make this work with what looks like pretty terrible margins if any at all.  For example im looking to add some ashwagandha gummies looks like they cant be sold for anymore that 16$ USD but drop shipping cost would be around 10$ USD
[25.03.25, 8:51:54] ~ Cisco: Hi everyone, I have a quick question. I'm using an agency ad account for the first time, and they provided me with an ad account but without giving me any permissions. Now they're asking for full access to my Shopify and say they will set everything up themselves. Is that normal? Also, I’m not able to create a new ad account or pixel myself.
[25.03.25, 9:11:29] ~ Aaron Ware: Who’s selling them for $16 🤦‍♂️
[25.03.25, 9:13:00] ~ Mason Schulze: pretty much every listing on google shopping
[25.03.25, 9:50:57] ~ Phil: Hey guys, anyone selling clothing in person from their house or warehouses etc. looking into POS and want to make sure I’m doing it all properly
[25.03.25, 10:02:11] ~ Aaron Ware: Build a brand and sell it for $39. 

The product I sell is $20 on Amazon. I sell it for $80
[25.03.25, 11:57:11] ~ Mo: Ben working with agencies too, but never asked for shopify access. They need ur Bm to connect their ad acct thats it
[25.03.25, 12:38:44] ~ Cisco: yeah idk waht they are talking about normaly you just have ad account with acces and then you can set it up directly in the shopify store right?

Is that what ur talking about?
[25.03.25, 16:01:29] ~ Davide: Not really, I want to see some inspo from video that look very authenic, genuine, people that tell their story, etc etc 
Doing this, I’m thinking about a powerful and organic hooks, especially for visual, the clips ‎<This message was edited>
[25.03.25, 17:33:05] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys.
Do you duplicate CBOs with a higher budget, or just increase 25% every day/few days?
[25.03.25, 17:41:33] ~ Ben Mansour: 25% if roas is more than target the previous day
[25.03.25, 17:43:54] ~ Charles: Just did my first real « surf scale » attempt the other day and went ahead with a 80% bump. A little scary but it was worth it. Didnt down scale and we’ve managed to stabilize our performance around this budget, moral of this, always go for more! Sometimes ROAS wont decline or less than you think
[25.03.25, 17:44:03] ~ Guy Edan: Thanks 🙏
[25.03.25, 17:45:07] ~ Guy Edan: Awesome! So a 80% increase in one day? Was it a cbo?
[25.03.25, 18:50:58] ~ Jonny: No, not normal at all. I’ve used tons of agency accounts over the years. Why the hell would they need Shopify access.

If you need a good agency provide dm me

[25.03.25, 20:32:49] ~ Nicolò: margin bro?

[26.03.25, 7:54:13] ~ Bazeed: Either the supplier in china or 3pl

[26.03.25, 7:55:34] ~ George: Most suppliers I’ve worked with have a USA warehouse for returns. Holding fees vary of course but yours should be able to do the same

[26.03.25, 18:40:01] ~ Filippo: No
[26.03.25, 18:40:19] ~ Rick: so where you gonna save it?
[26.03.25, 18:40:52] ~ Filippo: Maybe I fixed it
[26.03.25, 18:40:57] ~ Rick: if there is no field for that information
[26.03.25, 18:41:00] ~ Filippo: Marked it as VAT number instead of custom
[26.03.25, 18:41:09] ~ Rick: yes you can do it
[26.03.25, 19:13:04] Amit Wadhawan: Only in the US.
[26.03.25, 22:21:51] ~ Mark Wagner: Damn this is tough to hear - reached out to you directly on it. I own Disputifier and if you guys have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly. We've grown a shit ton over the past 6 months and are still building the teams / systems to catch up with the growth - regardless, no excuse for us no showing a demo. Just a few things you guys should keep in mind when exploring chargeback platforms: 

- How do they treat SAFE alerts? Most providers just add this in as a normal Ethoca alert and don’t let you turn these off. The Majority of these SAFE alerts don’t turn into a chargeback so you’re left paying for and refunding customers that didn’t charge back. Causes a ton of “false positives”. We turn these off by default. 
- Do they flag/credit overlap? Are you ever paying for multiple different types of alerts on the same order? 
- Do they flag/credit can’t find, already refunded alerts? Are you ever paying for alerts that doesn’t prevent a chargeback?
- Do they offer PayPal alerts? We just launched this in beta, no one else offers it at the moment. 
- Do they offer Klarna alerts? We’re launching these next month. 
- Do they offer Order Insight / Compelling Evidence / Consumer Clarity? This will be even more important with the new visa dispute program 
- Do they also fight chargebacks not caught by alerts? Do they provide transaction scanning for fraud prevention? How about lost/late order identification for order not received prevention?

We’re not perfect by any stretch - but have the most complete chargeback platform in the market and it’s only getting better. If you guys have questions or suggestions, I’m an open book
[26.03.25, 22:41:54] ~ Zsombor: We currently use chargeblast. How are you better than them? Thank you.
‎[26.03.25, 23:03:16] ~ Mark Wagner: ‎image omitted
[26.03.25, 23:42:09] ~ Marcos: How your alert false positives work and why chargeblast doesn't implement? You both work with ethoca. I don't understand how would you notice that
[27.03.25, 0:08:49] ~ Mark Wagner: It's basically a default setting with Ethoca to have false positives, they add in a bunch of "fraud" alerts which don't actually mean there is an incoming chargeback. While other providers simply take these as-is, we have negotiated our deal with Ethoca so that these are always turned off by default.
[27.03.25, 0:21:23] ~ Malik: Hey guys, quick question : It's been like 2 weeks that my testing and scaling doesn't perform but my retargeting performs better than usual
[27.03.25, 0:21:41] ~ Malik: Do you think it's because of the messaging on my ads ? Did I "touch" all the first audiences with my initial ads

[28.03.25, 11:57:57] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Now you need a lawyer
[28.03.25, 11:58:46] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I feel this dmca thing is endless suffering even after enough good branding if you're using Shopify bro.
[28.03.25, 11:59:11] ~ Alvaro De Prada: The counter notice is your legal grounds to win the case easy.
[28.03.25, 11:59:23] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you can proof you are the owner of the copyrighted material
[28.03.25, 11:59:54] ~ OB: How much time and money would it cost?
[28.03.25, 12:00:16] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Depends on the lawyer and jurisdiction
[28.03.25, 12:00:26] ~ Alvaro De Prada: And claim of damages
[28.03.25, 12:00:29] ~ OB: These are pics I paid my supplier to shoot for me, how do I prove I am the copyright owner?
[28.03.25, 12:01:26] ~ OB: I couldn't care less about competition. I just cannot let a scumbag profit off my hard work and file a counter notice knowing the content is not his
[28.03.25, 12:02:19] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can show the conversation and payment

Also just by the timeline of events everything falls into place.

You can see through inspect element when the url was created and if is after yours… you win
[28.03.25, 12:03:08] ~ OB: Chargebacks and DMCA, 2 worlds where only the dishonest and fraudulent win..
[28.03.25, 12:03:19] ~ Alvaro De Prada: But you need a lawyer and also see your jurisdiction and the copycat jurisdiction
[28.03.25, 12:04:39] ~ OB: It is a whopping 5 years after mine was created
[28.03.25, 12:05:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: DMCA they don’t win if you push forward. Every fake DMCA is a very illegal thing to do punishable with unfair competition, fraud, damages and more. 

But is an expensive one. At least 10/20k just to get the ball rolling.

If is international even more, and if the copycat is broke…. Is a pain
[28.03.25, 12:12:04] ~ Miika: You should always get it on paper that you have the ownership and sole usage rights to that content when someone else creates it for you
[28.03.25, 12:12:19] ~ OB: Why do you have to spend 10k to prove that a thief stole something when everyone can see he stole?
[28.03.25, 12:13:02] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Because the lawyer wants money. And they have to gather all the evidence, figure out who to sue and sue
[28.03.25, 12:17:42] ~ Bojan: Guys any recommendation for a good agency ad acc?

[30.03.25, 6:01:54] ~ Mason Schulze: Have found some really good ones in our team from Upwork
[30.03.25, 6:02:03] ~ Ben Mansour: Creative strategist is one of hardest hires
[30.03.25, 6:02:14] ~ Mason Schulze: Agree
[30.03.25, 6:02:23] ~ Ben Mansour: You have to try many people in order to find a good fit

[30.03.25, 11:40:00] ~ Hylke: Depending on the relationship and bargaining power, securing delivery reliability and flexibility with regard to demand fluctuations is key. Payment terms, MOQs, batch discounts etc can often be negotiated when leveraging order volume or longer term commitments (though commitments might carry risk).
[30.03.25, 13:50:05] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hmm im looking to sign it with my supplier that's a good advice bro I'll dm you bc i see I might need some help.

[30.03.25, 15:24:00] ~ Fabian: is the script youre supposted to read randomized?
[30.03.25, 15:25:23] ~ Bazeed: exactly
[30.03.25, 15:25:46] ~ Bazeed: do you have anything in mind?
[30.03.25, 15:26:20] ~ Fabian: if the script wasnt randomized you could clone the voice in the ”normal” cloning, then use that voice in a soundboard
[30.03.25, 15:27:29] ~ Bazeed: thats what i thought but they have a timer n stuff, will make it work somehow tho, thanks
[30.03.25, 17:20:00] ~ Ben Mansour: Can you report a shopify store doing bh mrr on a third party checkout?

[30.03.25, 19:30:31] ~ K: Ads that where working on a different meta acc are now getting rejected on a new acc. Do i need to warm the acc up or something or is there a way to minimize the risk of being rejected besides following all guidelines
[30.03.25, 19:33:18] ~ Jeremy Khattar: always best practice to warm up your account first, it can be as simple as launching 10 vanilla ads just for approval to increase your approval score @⁨~K⁩ 

Also a page like or ppe campaign $1 or $2 dollars a day, let it spend
[30.03.25, 19:35:04] ~ K: Thank you so much
[30.03.25, 19:36:09] ~ Jeremy Khattar: no worries, we usually launch 50 vanila ads (picture of a puppy or anything river / water) and turn them off once they get approved, we also launch in parallel the other stuff mentioned above - that will increase the score of the account so you can avoid getting rejected
[30.03.25, 19:36:33] ~ Jeremy Khattar: also you might want to remove meta data on the creatives if they got rejected already - if you are launching something that was rejected it could be tagged in the system
[30.03.25, 19:36:59] ~ K: you are a absolute blessing my friend
[30.03.25, 21:54:19] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you give the strategist any performance bonuses etc what should you pay them

[31.03.25, 13:52:03] ~ Simeon Petrov: Omnisend is pretty cheap. Offers all the functionality you may need and is relatively user friendly.

You can also try Yotpo, there the benefit is that you pay only for what you send, so pricing is not based on the amount of contacts you have.

[31.03.25, 17:55:23] ~ Guy Edan: For people who run a single CBO campaign, if you think a creative can be a winner but doesn’t get spend, would you test it in an ABO campaign, or take it as “if it doesn’t get spend it wouldn’t be a winner”?
[31.03.25, 17:56:41] Carlos Leeseman: If you have more then 5/10 winners, create extra CBO campaign. Or just increase budget of the CBO, so it has more “space” to spend more on other creatives as well

[1.04.25, 11:13:49] ~ Steve: I don’t really understand the request - we verify that number all the time with text message
[1.04.25, 11:14:02] ~ Steve: we put it on our business docs

[1.04.25, 11:27:28] ~ Steve: Yes but isolate, just test the headline change nothing else.

In my experience the teams I consult for often can't help themselves. They will set up a headline test but then slightly tweak something else, maybe shift something else here or there thinking it's no big deal
[1.04.25, 11:27:43] ~ Steve: Just gotta isolate the headline
[1.04.25, 12:08:01] ~ Brandon: Can anyone recommend a german email marketing agency?
[1.04.25, 12:15:52] ~ Dominik Olszewski: Hey everyone 

Yesterday I switched to Shopify Payments, and it automatically disabled Stripe, which we’ve been using for subscriptions. The problem is that we have active subscribers on Stripe, and now they can’t process their recurring payments.

I’d like to keep Stripe active only for old subscription customers and use Shopify Payments for new customers

I know Shopify doesn’t allow both Stripe and Shopify Payments simultaneously for credit card payments, but…

Is there any workaround or app that lets us continue processing existing Stripe subscriptions while using Shopify Payments going forward?

Or maybe a way to migrate those Stripe subscriptions to a Shopify Payments?

Any advice, experience, or person recommendations would be super helpful 🙏
[1.04.25, 12:29:10] ~ Rick: funnelish? so orders are also automatically synchronised on shopify and you can manage everything from there
[1.04.25, 12:29:17] ~ Rick: and you can connect strie
[1.04.25, 12:29:18] ~ Rick: stripe
[1.04.25, 12:31:53] ~ Dominik Olszewski: Thanks will check that out

[1.04.25, 14:02:28] ~ Ry: how are u guys coping with chatgpt images? i noticed the more revisions i give, the more crazy it went 🤣
[1.04.25, 14:04:45] ~ RS: Try midjourney
[1.04.25, 14:05:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yh same, it took me hours to figure out but the best way is to put each and every single detail of the static story board at the first prompt to get the results, 

And if you want revisions you have to type the requirements and restrictions again. Still it will do number of mistakes

Its too good and annoying at the same time.
[1.04.25, 14:07:50] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Also guys this nerd, started ghosting me now, delaying stuffs, not worth it paying him

I have a friend in the GC I asked him, he is responding him at the same time but not me after paying 500$ for the onboarding.

Also even after he does it after this, his communication is too bad doesn't even listen you properly.
[1.04.25, 14:08:03] ~ Rick: did you guys already find a way how to make GIFs/ animations/ videos from the generated AI images? I am looking for ways to do this, would be awesome if people can point me in the right direction here!!
[1.04.25, 14:08:18] ~ Rick: or anyone else that found how to make videos from static images? :)
[1.04.25, 14:08:29] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I feel he will scam me further and I would have got approved easier if I did it normally with airwallex haha
[1.04.25, 14:10:00] ~ Omar: @⁨~Antonio Celani⁩ u sure u used him
[1.04.25, 14:38:41] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: He just responded me

[1.04.25, 14:41:49] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: No i paid for private onboarding on airwallex so he is my account manager and anything happens further he will handle it
[1.04.25, 14:42:14] ~ Omar: What’s benefit of that
[1.04.25, 14:42:23] ~ Omar: What special service can he do over the other guys

[1.04.25, 14:46:36] ~ Omar: hmm
[1.04.25, 14:46:39] ~ Omar: call him
[1.04.25, 15:51:02] ~ DD: nobody writes “hello dear”, 99% scam 🙁

[1.04.25, 16:00:20] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: no its my partner, me and him
[1.04.25, 16:00:50] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: im waiting for him to approve my account so I see his name on my airwallex account as a account manager is the only way to prove he is legit
[1.04.25, 16:00:59] ~ N: How does that work you didn’t sign up under airwallex first
[1.04.25, 16:01:18] ~ N: Ask airwallex does he work for them
[1.04.25, 16:01:18] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: he sent me a custom airwallex onboarding link though
[1.04.25, 16:01:44] ~ N: Hmm then you can’t really falsify this
[1.04.25, 16:02:30] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: yh exactly that's why I am waiting to see his name on the airwallex account.

[1.04.25, 16:07:19] ~ Arad Khazabi: Okay thanks
[1.04.25, 16:07:37] ~ Antonio Celani: Subi ( ex subify ) also very good i have it for my supps
[1.04.25, 16:08:16] ~ Nicolò: why bro?
[1.04.25, 16:08:58] ~ Ryan Leven: Because you don’t fully own your data / subs / have control over your business. 

Checkout champ gives you full control and ownership of your business.
[1.04.25, 16:16:40] ~ OB: looking at this nerd, I would never even get remotely close to doing any sort of transaction/business with him
[1.04.25, 16:23:37] ~ Jonny: Hi guys, anyone got a good broker they can recommend? We are looking to get our business valued and potentially sell. (Already been recommended KH Brokers, in talks with him)
[1.04.25, 16:39:17] ~ Jonny: anyone got a connection to help get a trademark set up?
[1.04.25, 16:41:49] ~ Rick: do it with amazon
[1.04.25, 16:44:06] ~ Jonny: even if you don't sell on there?
[1.04.25, 16:44:33] ~ Rick: yes, but why don't sell on amazon as well?

[2.04.25, 21:19:05] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: hey guys, here is a media buying question I would need help with. 

I use single cbo strategy and I do each concept in its individual adgroup. ido flex ads and 3-5 creatives per flex ads. 

now I have a winner adgroup and I see whenever I was making a winner ad variations I was doing it in different adgroup and then it always used to go learning phase first. 

so shud I just make a new flex ads with winner creatives variations under the same adgroup would be better instead of doing it under new adgroup?

For me the error was I put UK as country code instead of GB when selecting country

[2.04.25, 23:50:44] ~ Jonny: Had the same thing. Wanted to book a call with my meta rep, went through business manager to book a call. On the booking page it said to download webex for screen share. I never actually went ahead with the call as the reps are fucking useless…but I don’t think there’s anything to worry about IMO. Could be wrong, but I triple checked all links on the pages I went through to book the call and all were meta. It’s common practice for marketing reps to want to get on screen share to help optimise your performance , although most of them have zero knowledge on actually scaling campaigns properly.
[2.04.25, 23:51:48] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Is this tariffs imposed again??

[3.04.25, 1:04:27] ~ RS: If package is sent Through courier services like yunexpress, 4PX, then there will be applied regular import duties. If you send Through China post or epacket ( or something like that) then there will be 25$ fee per item or 30% value whichever is higher. That is how chatgpt interpreted it 😁 25$ on top of product cost if my COGs are 5$, its totally fucked up 😁

[3.04.25, 1:09:56] ~ Omar: cant do nothing about it thats out of our control
[3.04.25, 1:10:02] ~ Omar: need to find the solution asap
[3.04.25, 1:10:25] ~ Omar: taiwan 3pl
[3.04.25, 1:10:33] ~ Omar: taiwan to usa must not count?
[3.04.25, 1:10:33] ~ Mason Schulze: Sounds like will add a couple dollars of cost to each order
[3.04.25, 1:10:47] ~ Mason Schulze: Will just increase shipping price a couple dollars easy
[3.04.25, 1:11:56] ~ Steve: Next he will probably do something like massively lower US corp taxes - then those of us with Chinese suppliers and US companies won't know if we should like him or hate him
[3.04.25, 1:13:30] ~ N: whats the best place to get b roll from for VSLs?
[3.04.25, 1:13:51] ~ Nico: hi guys anyone have a tiktok ads insider?
[3.04.25, 1:13:56] ~ Nico: for spy
[3.04.25, 1:16:16] ~ Wouter: 30%
[3.04.25, 1:16:28] ~ Carlos: From the text, I don't see why it got interpreted as _whichever is higher_. I hope it isn't, it would completely kill shipping from China
[3.04.25, 1:17:26] ~ Carlos: The only bright side on this one is how dumb all those e-commerce gurus who suck  Trump's dick at any opportunity will look, when it was clear this was gonna be a disaster for this space since the beginning
[3.04.25, 1:17:58] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey but why is it a problem we just use yunepress, 4px no? I didn't get this
[3.04.25, 1:19:00] ~ Wouter: It’s not saying that
[3.04.25, 1:19:03] ~ Wouter: Just 30%
[3.04.25, 1:19:04] ~ Bryan T: I think he just slapped Taiwan with an extra 25% tariff
[3.04.25, 1:19:09] ~ Wouter: I can deal with that
[3.04.25, 1:19:22] ~ Jonny: Are the tariffs going to be placed on shipping cost, or product cost, or both?
[3.04.25, 1:19:34] ~ Nal: ive had a very similar thing with Webex, nothing ended up happening
[3.04.25, 1:20:03] ~ RS: Dont know man, I put it in chatgpt and asked to interpret it in simple words. Probably gpt fucked up😁
[3.04.25, 1:20:25] ~ Jonny: Trumps about to fuck up the whole eco system. And to think I thought he’d be good for the worldwide economy smh
[3.04.25, 1:20:28] ~ RS: . Total cost is product+shipping I guess
[3.04.25, 1:20:52] ~ Carlos: It says either 30% or 25$ per item, but it isn't clear when is each duty rate applied? How do you interpret it?
[3.04.25, 1:21:11] ~ Jonny: That sucks if it is. Customer will bare the increase as usual
[3.04.25, 1:25:29] ~ Jonny: Anyone been offered and taken Shopify capital before?
[3.04.25, 1:26:09] ~ Phil: Yeah bro I have. Loaned 17k ‎<This message was edited>
[3.04.25, 1:26:19] ~ Phil: ‎This message was deleted.
[3.04.25, 1:27:40] ~ Jonny: We just got offered quite a big chunk
‎[3.04.25, 1:28:19] ~ RS: ‎image omitted
[3.04.25, 1:28:28] ~ Phil: Yeah after I paid that back I got offered 120k or something
[3.04.25, 1:28:52] ~ Phil: @⁨~Jonny⁩
[3.04.25, 1:29:40] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: @⁨~RS⁩
[3.04.25, 1:30:42] ~ Wouter: The interest is insane
[3.04.25, 1:30:53] ~ Wouter: Look at things like wayfligher if you meed a loan
[3.04.25, 1:31:17] ~ Phil: Yeah it is
[3.04.25, 1:31:25] ~ RS: Yunexpress and 4PX are courier services and gpt said that this 30% or 25$ does not apply to this. It applies to international postal network shipments. But lets wait what chinese Agents say.
[3.04.25, 1:31:26] ~ Ben Mansour: Best way
[3.04.25, 1:31:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Is to ask supplier for credit line
[3.04.25, 1:31:41] ~ Ben Mansour: Usually 0% interest
[3.04.25, 1:31:47] ~ Ben Mansour: If you make more money they make more money
[3.04.25, 1:32:09] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: They probably be sleeping and waking up to heartattack
[3.04.25, 1:41:15] ~ Carlos: Yes, it's insisting in this interpretation for me as well.

_This is consistent with how minimum duty thresholds are usually enforced — a flat fee is used when the percentage is too low to meet it._
[3.04.25, 1:42:42] ~ Carlos: If it's right, it actually insane. It's effectively kills dropshipping to the US but it affects retail in general and many other industries as well
[3.04.25, 1:45:11] ~ Aaron Ware: Not really…increase your conversion rate 30% + increase AOV 30% with upsells and increase LTV 30% and you’ve doubled your store.
[3.04.25, 1:45:21] ~ Aaron Ware: Or decrease CPA 30%
[3.04.25, 1:45:27] ~ Aaron Ware: Just focus on what you can control
[3.04.25, 1:45:36] ~ RS: 😁
[3.04.25, 1:46:09] ~ Aaron Ware: 😘
[3.04.25, 1:48:07] ~ Carlos: 30% is fine, we can all deal with that. I'm talking about a 50$ fee per product
[3.04.25, 1:49:02] ~ Mike Ramsey: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hM1O7_hkl_CxIb8j_FWQmwHi6i8A4ppDg4yd7xQvtnE/htmlview
‎[3.04.25, 1:49:14] ~ Mike Ramsey: ‎image omitted
[3.04.25, 1:49:27] ~ Carlos: If that is the case then this industry is dead and we have to wait until a entire new logistical system of products imported in bulk and shipped from the US is created
[3.04.25, 1:49:32] ~ Mike Ramsey: Today’s updates on Tariffs
[3.04.25, 1:56:37] ~ Bryan T: Shoutout @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ For making this group, if I was on my own without the info in here i'd probably be losing my shit rn over all this
[3.04.25, 1:58:10] ~ Wouter: It’s not saying which is higher
[3.04.25, 1:58:21] ~ Wouter: It’s 30%
[3.04.25, 1:59:18] ~ RS: It says either 30% or 25$.  In trade terms it means which is higher
‎[3.04.25, 2:00:04] ~ RS: ‎image omitted
[3.04.25, 2:01:28] ~ Wouter: That’s what chatgpt is saying lol it’s not saying it on the doc
[3.04.25, 2:01:32] ~ Wouter: But will see
[3.04.25, 2:01:47] ~ Wouter: Last time it got rolled back
[3.04.25, 2:02:30] ~ Wouter: $25 would kill everything from china not only dropshipping. And 30% is shit but if your business can’t handle 30% on the cogs you run a shit business
[3.04.25, 2:02:54] ~ RS: In the doc they dont literally write it
[3.04.25, 2:03:13] ~ Carlos: I thought so as well. However ChatGPT says that usually duty fees are enforced the other way around though, with the flat fee being the minimum tax applied and that the percentage is only used if it's higher than the minimum fee.

It makes sense to be like that as well with the increase to 50$ in June.
[3.04.25, 2:03:27] ~ RS: Because “either 30% or 25$” means whichever higher also in other trade terms 😁
[3.04.25, 2:04:13] ~ RS: But gpt says that this does not apply to you if you ship with yunexpress or 4px or other courier networks. It applies to international postal networks
[3.04.25, 2:05:04] ~ RS: So if you ship with yunexpress, you will have regular duties and taxes. ~30% fee and fixed fee for every shipment
[3.04.25, 2:05:39] ~ RS: Previously, it was around 3$ fixed fee for every shipment. So just force people to buy bundles and its ok. Or just add a few dollars to Shipping cost or tax
[3.04.25, 2:05:58] ~ Wouter: I don’t think it will be $25 per item but will see
[3.04.25, 2:06:04] ~ Wouter: Will chat in may 😉
[3.04.25, 2:08:19] ~ Carlos: It's actually 50$ from June on as well lol. I think it's too ridiculous to be true, but I do think it is the correct interpretation of what's written.

We can probably expect rollbacks and new exemptions in the meantime anyway, so we really can only wait and see
[3.04.25, 2:09:36] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I don't think trump even sees what he signs
[3.04.25, 2:09:46] ~ Ben Mansour: It will never be 25 or 50$
[3.04.25, 2:10:18] ~ Ben Mansour: That‘s crazy, 95% of ecom business will go out of business like that
‎[3.04.25, 2:10:40] ~ RS: ‎image omitted
[3.04.25, 2:12:01] ~ RS: So there will not be any 25$. The same is for temu and aliexpress shipments. There will not be 25$ fee to some aliexpress product that is worth 1$ lol
[3.04.25, 2:16:56] ~ Steve: - Announce crazy tarrifs
- Market tanks 
- negotiate hard with countries to reduce tarrifs for 2-4 weeks
- claim W for every deal "negotiated"
- Market bounces a month later
- Claim W for stock market boom
[3.04.25, 2:17:16] ~ Steve: ^my personal thoughts on how it might go. Ego. Lots of ego.
[3.04.25, 2:22:01] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: now I literally regret why that sniper missed the shot that day...
[3.04.25, 2:24:33] ~ Steve: I dunno man that sounds pretty wild to say. You will never have a year in business where you don't have to deal with changes, challenges or surprises. Just gotta roll with it. Focus on what you can control
[3.04.25, 2:25:51] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: yes that's facts bro but all this happening every two weeks is crazy
[3.04.25, 2:34:35] ~ Mason Schulze: anyone else seeing dip in performance from today with all of this announced again?
[3.04.25, 3:26:10] ~ Fabian: I have not
[3.04.25, 3:28:28] ~ Fabian: Has anyone been running engagement campaigns on your winning ads?

I dont want to ruin the ad i already is scaling, thats why im asking. If no one have the experience with this, ill have to test it anyways.

Some people is saying it will hurt your ad, trick facebook into thinking the people that engage with your ad is your potential buyers. I highly doubt this. 

Let me know what you think!
[3.04.25, 4:09:01] ~ Al: Meta is only getting better and better bro, you're better off putting your focus on making better ads (aka better content) than on finding ways to trick the algo
[3.04.25, 4:15:27] ~ Mo: talked to them after this, they said they dont accept credit cards
[3.04.25, 4:25:18] ~ Guy Edan: We had a campaign do well in the last 2 days, increased the budget and it went flat today. 1 sale on $350 budget + CPC tripled. Would you let it run another day to see if stabilizes?
[3.04.25, 4:42:24] ~ Fabian: Is this an answer to my question? If it is, you did not answer my question
[3.04.25, 4:43:56] ~ Fabian: ‎This message was deleted.
[3.04.25, 4:52:52] ~ Fabian: It’s not about tricking algorithm, it’s about getting good engagement on the ads. 

It’s proven to convert better with a lot of good engagement
[3.04.25, 5:07:41] ~ Charles: Hey guys just heard about the tariffs again… do you think this will be true this time? 54%… we’re f*

[3.04.25, 6:45:12] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Bro pls do it, also i dmed you
[3.04.25, 7:15:16] ~ Mo: bro make sure ur domain is updated in airwallex. changed my domain and forgot to update it in airwallex. so got mine shut down just for that. pay attention to that.
[3.04.25, 8:01:55] ~ Gordon: hello does anyone please have the benchmark numbers for these metrics? i.e what % should we be aiming for?
Retention
Hook rate

50%
75%

[3.04.25, 9:06:48] ~ Jonas M. Arnold: Did you re-publish any ads recently?
[3.04.25, 9:07:45] ~ Jonny: We have a media buyer so not sure. I can confirm we don’t run traffic to china though
[3.04.25, 9:34:24] ~ Jonas M. Arnold: Yes - can be crawlers
[3.04.25, 10:42:00] ~ Filippo: who here is using Funnelish?

for credit card payments, do PURCHASE ATTEMPTS only show when people click the buy button and transaction doesn’t go through? ‎<This message was edited>
[3.04.25, 10:42:26] ~ Filippo: Where can I buy instagram followers?
[3.04.25, 10:50:10] Carlos Leeseman: Correct
[3.04.25, 10:50:57] ~ Filippo: insane, i got NMI and I had 4 purchase attempts, only 2 show on NMI and they are flagged as fraudolent
‎[3.04.25, 10:51:22] ~ Arad Khazabi: ‎image omitted
[3.04.25, 10:51:44] Carlos Leeseman: Could be several reasons. Are you cross-border selling?
[3.04.25, 10:51:54] ~ Filippo: US LLC - US customers
[3.04.25, 10:52:12] ~ Filippo: I tried with my revolut card and payment did go through. I dont get it
[3.04.25, 10:52:33] ~ Filippo: im 99.99% sure those purchase attempts were legit purchases
[3.04.25, 10:54:23] Carlos Leeseman: Hmm no idea. Maybe @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ can help you
[3.04.25, 11:17:53] ~ Arad Khazabi: *also anybody knows people that do photoshop for cheap?*
[3.04.25, 11:48:53] China Bigboss: Fiverr bro

[3.04.25, 11:50:13] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Gpt
[3.04.25, 11:50:41] ~ Arad Khazabi: Tried already, unfortunately didn’t worked
[3.04.25, 12:15:00] ~ M A N U E L: Yo guys, for the ones selling worldwide, have you split tested using a currency converter on the store but letting customer checkout only in USD vs using their own currency at checkout?
[3.04.25, 12:22:24] ~ Rick: @⁨~Mark⁩ can i talk to you in private?
[3.04.25, 12:35:41] ~ Mo: any example of a very good converting cart drawer ?
[3.04.25, 12:38:23] ~ harshil Thummar: Using own currency
[3.04.25, 12:40:04] ~ Mason Schulze: using shopify markets and no converter app worked better for us
[3.04.25, 13:00:55] ~ M A N U E L: so letting them checkout with their own currency?
[3.04.25, 13:06:42] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh
[3.04.25, 13:18:41] ~ M A N U E L: ok thanks guys
[3.04.25, 13:59:40] ~ Robin: Hey guys, does anyone know a talented copywriter or consultant who excels at training/customizing GPTs for deep research, creating custom avatars, copywriting, and similar tasks? We're happy to compensate for their expertise!
[3.04.25, 14:04:10] Topi: yeah

[3.04.25, 15:23:21] ~ Jonny: anyone got any templates for a 5 reasons why style page?
[3.04.25, 15:23:56] ~ Phil: Instant page builder have some nice ones
[3.04.25, 15:25:04] ~ Jonny: building it inside shopify for testing purposes for now
[3.04.25, 15:31:07] ~ Mithiran: does anyone have a contact for setting up a usa company from australia?

[3.04.25, 16:42:10] ~ Bazeed: Anyone has a contact for cheap trustpilot reviews that stick?
[3.04.25, 16:45:19] ~ OB: haha just sell high quality products, and have stellar customer support, do these 2 things for at least 2 years
[3.04.25, 16:56:46] ~ Mo: anyone set up Sonar ( Triple whale capi) with funnelish ?
[3.04.25, 17:04:48] ~ Seth: Our brand page got taken down for copyright because it was reported by a fraudulent verified page pretending to be us.

Anyone have same issue? Already submitted counter so we’ll get it back, I’m just confused what the motive behind this is… They literally link to our domain, so it’s not like they’re stealing our traffic.

Is it for phishing or?
[3.04.25, 18:33:53] ~ Kyle Twohill: for the people running the one cbo strat, I created a bundle offer with my product with a bunch of other products I sell at a discount on a new LP. Do you run this in a new CBO or just keep it in the same
[3.04.25, 18:37:20] ~ Jacobo Uribe: ‎~ Mark added ~ Jacobo Uribe
[3.04.25, 18:49:43] ~ Bojan: Hey guys, I started a beauty store and my ads are getting rejected so hard.

I already switched few ad accs, but no improvement.

Are you using agency ad accs for this niche?
 
Any advice is appreciated!
[3.04.25, 18:53:52] ~ Charles: I would do another if different LP or different objective
[3.04.25, 18:54:39] ~ Matt: Even if you do a split test on new LPs?
[3.04.25, 18:54:55] ~ Matt: Wouldn’t it make more sense just split testing LP in same CBO
[3.04.25, 18:54:56] ~ Matt: ?
[3.04.25, 18:55:54] ~ Charles: For split test yes, but completely new LP like a prelander different CBO
[3.04.25, 18:56:32] ~ Matt: And all same creatives just different target LP?
[3.04.25, 19:02:55] ~ Charles: You want to try the same creatives on multiples LPs?
[3.04.25, 19:17:54] ~ Matt: Yh so same creatives but test maybe a pre sales page to sales LP
[3.04.25, 19:18:11] ~ Matt: Usually I just set up a traffic redirect test instead of new campaign
[3.04.25, 19:25:53] ~ Charles: Maybe I would test in the same one. Let us know the results!
[3.04.25, 19:40:37] ~ Kyle Twohill: So the ads in the main cbo talk about just the hero product not the bundle. So I assume split testing that wouldn’t work compared to using the ads I had made where it talks about and shows the whole bundle.
[3.04.25, 20:06:49] ~ Matt: Yh I would consider that a separate product almost so best to separate
[3.04.25, 20:08:17] ~ Al: better ads get better engagement. Think about great content and great ads as the same thing. A great ad is only great not only because it gets conversions but also because people enjoy watching it. 

Great content + great performance = great ad

Average content + great performance = good ad

The first will always get more favor from Meta because Meta doesn't just reward ads that make sales, it rewards ads that people have a good time consuming
[3.04.25, 20:12:29] ~ Al: An answer to your question won't solve the problem you're trying to fix by asking this question, so I thought I'd try to help instead. Ask better questions get better answers
[3.04.25, 20:13:44] ~ Al: If you don't understand this you'll always be chasing rabbits and having "ad fatigue"
[3.04.25, 21:33:41] ~ Kyle Twohill: how aggressively will you guys scale in a day if your like 30% above your target roas
[3.04.25, 21:37:46] ~ Fabian: @⁨~Al⁩ “better ads better engagement” of course, but you’ll get a lot more by having engagement as the campaign goal
[3.04.25, 21:40:01] ~ Fabian: @⁨~Al⁩ let’s say I have all these “requirements “ or whatever I call them.

Good content , good performance , good ad overall

If I can buy good engagement thru an engagement campaign, what’s wrong with it?
[3.04.25, 21:40:41] ~ Fabian: Feels like you answered my question assuming my ads are bad
[3.04.25, 21:42:24] ~ Fabian: If I have a good ad , good content as you say. People enjoy it, it would still not get as much engagement as in an engagement campaign
[3.04.25, 21:43:23] ~ Fabian: I have seen strategies like this and basically my question is if anyone have tried it.
[3.04.25, 22:36:32] ~ Al: yes I've tried them, no they haven't worked. I didn't assume your ads were bad, I assumed you were looking for a hack to improve meta performance, and my point is that Meta will always correct for this bs sooner or later. In my opinion, and what's helped our team improve, has been to focus our efforts into leaning toward what Meta wants instead ‎<This message was edited>
[3.04.25, 22:40:09] ~ Fabian: Thank you for your opinion on this
[3.04.25, 23:14:07] ~ Matt: For people doing single cbo campaign, If you guys have a bunch of new creatives (30-40) do you upload them all at once or do you spread them out each week ?
[3.04.25, 23:14:16] ~ Matt: Doesn’t even matter or will the best ones rise to the top
[3.04.25, 23:14:50] ~ Phil: Ones that have same concept but different hooks chuck them in one ad set, then so forth so forth with different ad sets
[3.04.25, 23:14:54] ~ Phil: You can put them all in one
[3.04.25, 23:15:11] ~ Phil: You can use that as a testing campaign then use your top performers to scale in ASC+ ‎<This message was edited>
[3.04.25, 23:22:25] ~ Damjan Topalovic: 3 Scripts 3 Hooks 3 Scroll Stoppers Test ABO or CBO?
[3.04.25, 23:23:10] ~ Phil: If your testing then CBO
[3.04.25, 23:23:28] ~ Phil: Within this you could have over 30 videos
[3.04.25, 23:26:24] ~ Damjan Topalovic: yep
[3.04.25, 23:48:48] ~ Filippo: most of my transactions are declined and mark as ‘suspected fraud’…on a new processor..who can help?
[3.04.25, 23:53:39] ~ Filippo: anyone has direct contact with someone at Payarc?
[3.04.25, 23:57:36] ~ Mike Kasdorf: We do 1 script, 3 hooks/script, 5 scroll stoppers/hook = 15 variants per ad. ABO for testing, CBO for scaling.
[3.04.25, 23:58:18] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Each hook gets its own ABO for testing
[4.04.25, 0:06:33] ~ Matt: But would you launch them all at once or spread out over a few weeks?
[4.04.25, 0:15:47] ~ Kyle Twohill: what about primary text/HLs
[4.04.25, 0:16:52] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Fixed, not flex. Usually an iteration of the hook, or a statement/question that is drawn from the copy within the ad.
[4.04.25, 0:25:43] ~ Al: if you have many iterations of the same concept, you can also cheaply run them in an awareness campaign with adset goal "ad recall lift" to pick the potentially best. We make ~10-20 variations of a concept (hook, ad length, etc), run them all for 5k impressions each in this way, and pick the 3 with the lowest cost per unique click all
[4.04.25, 0:26:06] ~ Al: but all this really depends on what those 30-40 ads are and at what scale you're at
[4.04.25, 0:26:32] ~ Al: oh then the 3 best ones for each concept we run them in the CBO as an adset
[4.04.25, 0:31:26] ~ Matt: Yh my question is more on if you have say 10 unique concepts with 4 hook variations each do you launch them all at once or spread out over 2 weeks
[4.04.25, 0:32:52] ~ Mike Kasdorf: 3 concepts per week. Possibly a 4th on the weekend.
[4.04.25, 0:32:58] ~ Al: depends on your scale tbh if you're at bigger scale, you can likely afford to test 10 unique concepts with decent spend/day without this ending up being a huge % of your total budget
[4.04.25, 0:33:14] ~ Al: but if testing 10 concepts and giving them enough budget/day is gonna take a significant chunk of your budget, it could hurt you
[4.04.25, 0:33:22] ~ Al: yeah simple answer, I agree
[4.04.25, 0:33:50] ~ Mike Kasdorf: we got pretty aggressive a month ago and launched 4 in 4 days and it didn't go well for any of them.
[4.04.25, 0:36:10] ~ Al: for us the most important things are that 
(1) we can comfortably leave them for long enough - at least 1 week, ideally 2
(2) we can give them enough budget/day - we go with a minimum spend of $50/d and let fb give them more if it likes it
(3) the testing budget doesn't go higher than 10% of account spend
[4.04.25, 0:38:55] ~ Mike Kasdorf: These are solid tips. Starring it. We usually start at $100/day, but that can burn things up a little more quickly and makes it so we can't test as long.
[4.04.25, 0:44:05] ~ Matt: Ok thanks Yh I usually launch 4 concepts / 4 hooks per week Sunday midnight but have just received another batch from strategist early so wondering whether to just launch them all straight away 👍
[4.04.25, 5:47:57] ~ Mo: currently stuck with this : video editor make creatives ( but sometimes they get rejected for compliance meta, snap, tt… ) so need someone to double check the creatives and work with video editor to make sure creatives are compliant. how do u guys get around that ? u hire someone for this position, or u just train your video editor ?
[4.04.25, 5:48:35] ~ Phil: Are you sure it’s not the primary texts headlines etc??
[4.04.25, 5:49:52] ~ Mo: its both actually, for script i can take care of it, but for visuals …but if i can find someone who can check both, thats ideal
[4.04.25, 8:19:06] ~ Mithiran: How much do you guys pay a good philippines video editor?
[4.04.25, 8:36:24] Carlos Leeseman: $1000-1500 a month for full-time
[4.04.25, 8:37:01] ~ Mithiran: Usd?
[4.04.25, 8:37:56] Carlos Leeseman: Yes
[4.04.25, 8:38:53] ~ Ben Mansour: @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩ how many scripts can he edit per week?
[4.04.25, 8:39:54] Carlos Leeseman: Depends how long. Our KPI is 2-minutes a day. So if script is 2 minutes long, 5 per week.

Iknow seems a bit long, but they don’t understand the language, so takes little bit more time
[4.04.25, 8:40:52] ~ Mo: Do u have scripts/briefs ready each week for them, like a weekly plan? ‎<This message was edited>
[4.04.25, 8:42:20] Carlos Leeseman: What do you mean? 

We have 3 full time editors, so based on that we can do 10 new concepts a week + iterations on winning concepts we have running.

We have for each script a briefing/storyboard for the editor
[4.04.25, 8:59:11] ~ Mikael: Anyone who have some Data or split tested whats working best to send back data to FB pixel? Weetracked, any other or just simply Facebook Conversion API?
[4.04.25, 9:15:30] ~ Mo: For script/briefing do u have them ready prior the week, so they know exactly what they will be working on each week.  Do u have a weekly plan or sth for them ? Sometimes i get left behind & video editors kinda wait for me to make the briefs.
[4.04.25, 9:18:53] ~ Mithiran: How much do you pay for a creative strategist
[4.04.25, 9:45:03] Carlos Leeseman: We’re working with task management system Click Up. Here they can see their tasks, deadline, next task, etc
[4.04.25, 9:45:24] Carlos Leeseman: I’m doing copywriting and strategy by myself
[4.04.25, 9:52:59] ~ Mo: got it , clear ! thanks bro
[4.04.25, 12:16:19] ~ Alexander Sundström: For e-mail marketing:

What is a good percentage or acceptable percentage coming out of campaigns
[4.04.25, 12:16:51] ~ Alexander Sundström: Right now we have 80% from flows and 20% from campaigns. Overall 25% of revenue
[4.04.25, 12:20:27] ~ Bazeed: For people using bestfulfil here as their supplier, is it safe to use stripe with their shipping time (10-12 days)? Has anyone had issues because of the risk factor from stripe
[4.04.25, 12:22:23] Carlos Leeseman: No, just make sure your communication with customers is high level. 

- Great email shipping flow
- ⁠Fast customer support
- ⁠Offer REAL solutions when people complain about shipping time
[4.04.25, 12:23:34] ~ Mithiran: What do you normally put in the email flows? And what are the solutions you give when people complain?
[4.04.25, 12:23:37] ~ Bazeed: Amazing thanks man
[4.04.25, 12:28:40] Carlos Leeseman: First email: Thank you for your order, our team is wrapping your order immediately
Second email: Your order has been shipped
Third email (halfway through shipping): Your order is on its way from our manufacturer to our warehouse
Fourth email: Your order has arrived at our local center
Fifth email: Your order is ready for delivery

——

If people have paid for shipping, we refund them if shipping takes longer than what we say on our website. Furthermore, if they get really angry, or want to complain to the bank, we sometimes refund 20/30%. But 9/10x this is not even necessary if communication is good, clear and honest with the customer and especially if you call the customer. I really NEVER get disputes/issues with payment processors because of “long” shipping.
[4.04.25, 12:32:55] ~ Mithiran: How do you setup those emails to send when order is at local center & ready for delivery?
[4.04.25, 12:34:35] ~ Gideon: Send more campaigns. We have 50 50. We do 2 campaigns weekly. Make a calendar for campaigns. 2 with value and more sneaky/undercover selling. then 1 sales mail. Do story telling on the same days so you cam connect with tour sibscribers and stay on top of mind
[4.04.25, 12:36:41] Carlos Leeseman: Connect with tracking app on Shopify
[4.04.25, 12:37:22] ~ Alexander Sundström: Cool! We do 3 campaigns a week, just sales mail. I thought the campaign percentage was low on our end. I will have to get that up. Thanks for your response
[4.04.25, 12:39:20] ~ Gideon: Okay. I think people get tired of 3 sales mail per week. Tell a backstory about your company. Depending on the niche give some tips. Make it interesting
[4.04.25, 12:40:51] ~ Aaron Ware: https://www.luminskin.com/pages/led-mask-lp?country=AU&ttclid=E_C_P_CtMBO1l02d1q9qD9MkUzW1EtA3P1fDijesrULJpGwluOuiiZ5kz2Jzkp23AVLwdrT-Kmjd5OtiZR4HnhhRaTdAc8NZqGgBQY13dcvK2DN7FYrb0_wQrPibUBJJPXCVagd5vvThWeYdtcraPCt7YQ54CptPUfqH1YiHdfhFPQNkoOjCK53lUO2xBD2eYDkAbz71AUVTUvy5-nZQ4-u2A4hZ-FhHbBLtkyKCD2HHki5xFRm7LAfuHAtppA5hruBAJafQqlZL9g5iynzahrUT2pbSrsQwZ7tBIEdjIuMA&utm_campaign=L344_9x16_V2.mp4_001&utm_content=US%2BAU%2BUK%2BCAN_Prospecting_Website%20Conversion_SC&utm_medium=Paid%20Social&utm_source=Tik%20Tok

[4.04.25, 12:46:00] ~ Aaron Ware: Does anyone have a contact for reddit agency? Get some decent articles published that look organic
[4.04.25, 13:53:54] ~ Matt: Hey has anyone got a good email marketing freelancer that has worked in supps before?
[4.04.25, 13:54:35] ~ Arad Khazabi: *everyone that is working with creators on influee, is it normal for them to be so unresponsive?*
[4.04.25, 13:57:13] ~ Mason Schulze: normal they can be a pain
[4.04.25, 15:19:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone here running ads on applovin?

[6.04.25, 13:00:31] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hmm, also i had a question. People using third party payment processing for stores shipping to multiple countries
- how do you split revenue between different payment processors (manually changing it every week on the store or?)
- people shipping to multiple countries using third party processors do you guys just use the $ for checkout or it shows a huge difference and y'all have seperate store for each country with good revenue?
[6.04.25, 13:19:47] ~ Vish: Ideally recommend having a separate store for each country. Keeps the structure very clean without a mess.
[6.04.25, 13:20:59] ~ Vish: I recommend doing a HK setup with nominee.
[6.04.25, 13:21:17] ~ Vish: The Airwallex and PayPal reps help you out
[6.04.25, 13:21:28] ~ Vish: Stripe just bans you without any reason
[6.04.25, 13:21:31] ~ Vish: Always a headache
[6.04.25, 13:21:53] ~ Filippo: Airwallex for US only transactions is trash
[6.04.25, 13:22:55] ~ Vish: At least better than a random ban 😥😥
[6.04.25, 13:23:56] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Not really if u get a HK airwallex they have collaborated with paypal, klarna, etc and that's good. U need to check it out
[6.04.25, 13:24:11] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I'll let you know about the approval rate once I use it 😂😂
[6.04.25, 13:24:17] ~ Vish: Yep agree
[6.04.25, 13:24:28] ~ Filippo: I’ve heard bad things about Airwallex lately
[6.04.25, 13:25:51] ~ Vish: HK Airwallex or Airwallex in general?
[6.04.25, 13:29:25] ~ Filippo: in general
[6.04.25, 13:29:59] ~ Vish: I personally didn't have any bad experience, maybe others might have
[6.04.25, 13:33:42] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Thats true but using a $ at checkout for all countries what do you think the drop-off would be? Bc i wanna make it like i only seperate the stores for countries generating me over 3k a day.
[6.04.25, 13:34:07] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Bro you're processing with airwallex? How much revenue are you fluently processing a month?
[6.04.25, 13:40:45] ~ ...: Is there any course or framework for creative strategy you would recommend?
[6.04.25, 13:41:44] ~ Vish: Yeah you ideally test it out first. And only if it makes some sales then separate it out
[6.04.25, 13:42:10] ~ Vish: Currently 250k+
[6.04.25, 13:42:46] ~ Vish: Had initial hiccups but then it becomes smooth eventually

[6.04.25, 21:51:05] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey everyone i need a advice on this please.

So today I got my business manager hacked and page, I have no access to it (no cards attached and i used that bm just for pixel so my cards are safe)

I wanted to change the page so regardless Idc about it, but I lost access to my pixel with the bm (yes I'm dumb I didn't share it to other bms for backup)

Now I just have the pixel connected to my main ad account, so I am going to keep running from it but I want advice on how should I transition to a new pixel from this bc if I ever face a ad account ban, I will loose all data and this brand is new (its been a month only).

Should I just get one more ad account with new pixel and run ads on it and as it gets traction in a week or few I should transition?
[6.04.25, 21:51:18] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Please let me have advices on this guys, thanks!
[7.04.25, 2:43:37] ~ Charles: Hey guys with a LLC in Wyoming do you really pay 0% taxes? I cant believe it’s that simple. Or it depends where you’re coming from?

[7.04.25, 3:41:21] ~ Aaron Ware: Dude you need to speak to a qualified professional. Paying $0 tax legally ? Does it sound correct to you?
[7.04.25, 3:47:46] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey guys, anyone that's moved from US, AUS, UK to dubai, I have some questions regarding bank accounts, payment processing, etc if someone is willing to chat with me would be much appreciated  🙏
[7.04.25, 4:05:33] ~ Wouter: Nobody is really talking about what will happen on may 2? But how are you guys going to deal with this? $25 per order is a lot.
[7.04.25, 5:37:08] ~ Mo: bro did u make a training/sop for ur employees on how to use clickup ?
[7.04.25, 10:27:02] ~ Mithiran: Isnt it 30% of good value or $25?
[7.04.25, 10:27:48] ~ RakanGammoh: Feel free to DM me, I can help out!
[7.04.25, 10:29:49] ~ Steve: We already have established a 3PL in California. We know overall this will eat into our margin, but will work to find cost savings in other areas and negotiate better terms with the supplier. 

Then, once we are moving more volume on a trailing 90-120 days, we will begin speaking to US supplement manufacturing. They will be more expensive of course than our current manufacturing - but when you approach them with volume you can negotiate better and drive down COGS
[7.04.25, 10:30:59] ~ Steve: We're a US company with US based founders - I think something that's coming from Trump that people are not listening to is after tarrifs he is going to massively slash taxes. He has stated for a long time he wants corporate tax down to 15% and maybe even 12% so it's as low as some European countries offer.
[7.04.25, 10:31:34] ~ Mason Schulze: This is correct, and would be declared value right?
[7.04.25, 10:31:45] ~ Steve: That stuff would be beneficial if we are a 100% American company making 100% of our goods in the US. 

Probably things like our custom water bottles we will still do in China and just bite the bullet
[7.04.25, 10:33:12] ~ Wouter: Do you really think he can do this? I personally think he won’t even get the chance. The USA (and probably the world) is going into a recession. The USA customer will pay  a way higher price for everything.
[7.04.25, 10:34:43] ~ Steve: Yes he's going to do this. He doesn't give a fuck now. He doesn't have to win reelection, and shockingly I actually think some of these moves longer term will benefit the US working man instead of the US Investing man. Might even benefit young people long term - and I'm all for that because FUCK the boomers and their investments. Most selfish generation that ever existed. They can withstand some pain
[7.04.25, 10:34:52] ~ Steve: This is just how it's going to be for now
[7.04.25, 10:35:12] ~ Steve: So it's best to just adapt, make moves and not try and guess what comes next. He seems pretty serious to me
[7.04.25, 10:35:21] ~ Mithiran: Yeah declared value, but which one would it be? The 30% or the $25 - is it based on whichever is higher?
[7.04.25, 10:39:18] ~ Mason Schulze: Agree, it's a smart tacticle move imo. And a great chance if you invest also to get into the market low and make a lot of money when it bounces back. Will also force interest rates to drop, which I think is part of the plan.
[7.04.25, 10:42:24] ~ Steve: Yes - and based on the amount of complaining i see in many groups/social media from business owners I have a feeling most won’t be able to survive this, which is great news for the ones who adapt and make it through.

It’s like Tony Robbins says guys, if you build your businesses to survive during the winter of bad economic times, then you thrive during the spring and summer of economic booms. I see it as if we adapt as a business, survive and thrive through this and then he changes his mind on tarrifs etc - who cares, we already figured out the hard part
[7.04.25, 10:43:17] ~ Steve: the good news is A.I. is also making it easier to run your team leaner and leaner than ever
[7.04.25, 10:44:12] ~ Wouter: Good to see some positivity around this 🙂
[7.04.25, 10:45:26] ~ Mason Schulze: There is a lot of positivity that will come from it, and some big opportunities
[7.04.25, 10:46:33] ~ Mason Schulze: Have already seen CPMs dropping big time past couple days as competition folds and leaves the market
[7.04.25, 10:48:23] ~ Steve: Yeah we saw this during covid.

At the start, more ecomm style brands got scared and first thing they cut was ad spend because they are risk adverse.

But the hardcore direct response brands know when there is blood in the water and they increased spend. At the time I was only doing Copywriting for 8 and 9 figure supplement brands. 

Between 2020 and 2021 I made 5x more money than between 2015-2-2020 LOL it was nuts
[7.04.25, 10:48:51] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you ship with Yun/4px is 30% of declared value (usually they under declare). So more or less should be a 3/4$ price hike.

If you ship with China post and stuff like that, then is 25$

I think is due to the cost of inspection
[7.04.25, 10:49:24] ~ Steve: smart brands get aggressive when everyone is scared. Vshred went from 100m company to 400m company during covid for example. lots of examples of that. Brand I was with was doing $5-$15m per year, by 2022 was doing 15-20m per month!
[7.04.25, 10:49:59] ~ Mason Schulze: Exactly the details i have from our supplier already, so have increased shipping price early by 4$ with no negative effect
[7.04.25, 10:50:43] ~ Phil: You can hide a few dollars in product price and shipping won’t make a big difference
[7.04.25, 10:50:49] ~ Wouter: I don’t think it’s that - what about the $25?
[7.04.25, 10:50:56] ~ Wouter: Like if it’s that there is no stress at all
[7.04.25, 10:51:10] ~ Wouter: We would that kill ecommerce like everyone is saying
[7.04.25, 10:51:15] ~ Steve: We’re testing Tarrif ads this week. We have room to play on margin so we’re actually going to lower price, run ads “This brand is crazy, while everyone is raising prices during tarrifs, they’re actually lowering prices. I don’t know if someone is gonna get fired over there but this is crazy guys check this out..."
[7.04.25, 10:51:15] ~ Wouter: If it’s just 30%
[7.04.25, 10:51:22] ~ Steve: hooks like that - aggresive AF
[7.04.25, 10:51:37] ~ Wouter: That’s interesting
[7.04.25, 10:52:04] ~ Mason Schulze: Better to do in shipping IMO people are more dedicated to purchasing at that stage
[7.04.25, 10:53:50] ~ Alvaro De Prada: What most brands are stressing about (and with good reason) is that from one day to another they got a 45% increase in COGS when importing.

So if you made an order on March and you paid 100k for cogs, while the boat is in the water you get tariff hikes. You gotta pay 45k when it lands in US. 

So is a big unexpected cost
[7.04.25, 11:00:46] Carlos Leeseman: I actually think this all is a huge advantage for anyone running a brand. A lot of the competition, especially dropshippers, won’t be able to keep up and will eventually leave the market. 

That creates a lot of opportunities for you. Chinese suppliers will be more open to offering better prices to reliable brands like yours. CPMs will drop, and ultimately, you’ll see better CPAs as a result.

So instead of seeing this as a rise in expenses, try flipping the perspective, this shift could actually benefit your business if you play it right I think
[7.04.25, 12:20:28] ~ Filippo: People with US LLC, I have a PayPal with my old italian company, I cant change the tax id to US..how can I fix this?
[7.04.25, 13:11:08] ~ Marlon Martinez: Somebody here got a payoneer contact?
[7.04.25, 13:11:20] Fabian: +1
[7.04.25, 14:05:34] ~ Nal: We are trying to file Forms 5472 & 1120 as a non-US resident operating a US LLC. We asked the person who helped us to form the LLC to help us with this and they are charging $200, is this a fair price?
If anyone has a better, reliable contact, would appreciate an intro
[7.04.25, 14:09:15] ~ Alvaro De Prada: price is good. I paid double haha
[7.04.25, 14:12:36] ~ Nal: Thank you
[7.04.25, 14:20:42] ~ Alexander Sundström: what do you guys think about "maximize number of conversions" vs "maximize value of conversions"? on meta
[7.04.25, 14:20:58] ~ Alexander Sundström: i mean what is your take on that
[7.04.25, 14:21:55] ~ Wouter: What do you guys think about selling electric products from china. The supplier says it has CE certificate and the product would be a good addition to our range. But I’m concerned about electric items
[7.04.25, 14:23:43] ~ Alexander Sundström: it works well, test it yourself and ask your supplier for CE-certificate. We have been selling electronics for years
[7.04.25, 15:09:57] ~ Mo: been some time i didnt do this, when u buy a new fb profile, after u sign in, can u accept invites to join BM + launch ppe campaign same day or better to wait a bit ?
[7.04.25, 15:33:17] ~ Santi Roa: Be VERY careful! I did this with my Danish company and a few months later they blocked my account.

I spoke to a rep at the time and he told me to create a new one for the llc (that got me blocked)
[7.04.25, 15:33:22] ~ Santi Roa: I think you need to close the current account and open a 100% new one
[7.04.25, 15:35:22] ~ Santi Roa: You can definitely keep one open while you open the other, but running 2 simultaneusly will give you problems in the near future
[7.04.25, 15:37:30] ~ Filippo: great thank you. Waiting on ITIN to get the US paypal
[7.04.25, 15:43:49] ~ ….: anyone having telegram agency ad account?
[7.04.25, 15:45:44] ~ Charles: No but that’s what I heard again and again so I was just asking here cause I know a lot of you have LLC and do not come from the US
[7.04.25, 16:08:19] ~ Brice: Does anyone have a contact for removing Reddit posts / comments?
[7.04.25, 16:09:46] ~ Firass: dm me
[7.04.25, 16:31:41] ~ Jonny: hi guys, got a demo call with Disputifier tomorrow. Anyone recommend these? Or are there any better alternatives?
[7.04.25, 16:36:17] ~ Alvaro De Prada: they are pretty good
[7.04.25, 17:00:00] ~ Austin: Does anyone have a good competitor analysis template they wouldn't mind sending me?
[7.04.25, 17:34:07] ~ Al: hahaha this is crazy let us know how it goes Steve!
[7.04.25, 17:35:06] ~ Al: I don't think you can bro - you have to open a US paypal with your US company details

[7.04.25, 19:22:02] ~ Alex Elfi: Yo guys wanted to get your thoughts on something. We have some super virals IG reels like 1m+ views that we tried launching in ads on Meta but they just wouldn't work. Ironically on platforms like Applovin and Pinterest they are crushing. We are in the home niche btw. Any recommendation on what you would do to make them work on Meta?
[7.04.25, 19:22:14] ~ Rick: you have to ask to your supplier in wich code his your prodcut, and they gonna tell you
[7.04.25, 19:23:06] ~ Rick: mirror it

US is a big country and selling there from China would never stop, US citizens have good money and we need it, have a look at this guy it's just for time being and I think everything will be settled

[7.04.25, 20:28:12] ~ Nal: We just cleared a False DMCA by submitting a counter.

Had to wait 2 weeks for it to clear.  

3 days later, the same people DMCA us using Bustem agency for “using an unlicensed
version of the following theme: (links their pdp)” 

Anyone had this before? ‎<This message was edited>
[7.04.25, 20:29:57] ~ Steve: we have been dealing with DCMA recently, it crushed us. Wasn’t fake, was from actual person, and they hit everyone in our market, we weren’t even using much. A single 3 second clip - some people were full using AI on the clips of the guy to make him say their product lol
[7.04.25, 20:30:38] ~ Steve: but it giantly fucked us - 15k+ days down to like 0, we’re climbing back now though - our insider told us someone was going into our meta account every 48 hours to put the DMCA notice back on the account AFTER our insider had removed it
[7.04.25, 20:30:49] ~ Steve: so, yeah, it can be a huge pain in the ass.
[7.04.25, 20:31:07] ~ Nal: Yeap, everytime we gain momentum we get fucked by DMCA
[7.04.25, 20:31:18] ~ Nal: Worst part is it’s not even legit lol we haven’t stolen their content
[7.04.25, 20:31:36] ~ Steve: yeah platforms like this Bustem and others need to be shut down
[7.04.25, 20:31:39] ~ Rick: Do you have trademark?
[7.04.25, 20:31:45] ~ Steve: they created it to be “helpful” but its just getting abused

[8.04.25, 0:45:03] ~ Powa: Hey guys, just wanted to ask if anyone’s experienced something similar.
I stopped buying Facebook feedback scores since February, and since then, my performance has dropped significantly. Not sure if it’s just a coincidence or if it’s actually affecting my ad account performance.
The reason I stopped is because Facebook hasn’t been updating the page score since October anyway, so I figured it didn’t matter anymore.
Curious if any of you are still buying scores or have seen anything similar since stopping? Would really appreciate your thoughts on this
[8.04.25, 3:22:12] ~ Seth: Looking to implement subscriptions & switch to US manufacturing for supplement brand.

[8.04.25, 14:35:22] ~ UHO: Hey everyone, I could use some advice and support.

I’m currently going through a tough situation with a co-founder I brought on board in November 2024. Due to ongoing issues around attitude and performance, I’ve decided it’s best to dissolve the partnership and return to running the company solo.

What I need right now is a neutral mediator—someone with a good understanding of business and partnerships who can help facilitate a fair and respectful conversation. You don’t need to be a legal expert, just someone experienced and objective enough to help both sides reach clarity.

As a thank-you, I recently invested in a local creative agency and I’d be happy to offer a month’s worth of static design content in exchange for your time.

If this sounds like something you can help with, please reach out. I’d really appreciate it.
[8.04.25, 15:37:14] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Just asking... why not an actualy mediator/lawyer?
[8.04.25, 15:46:12] ~ Jonny: Hi guys, anyone recommend a dev for speed optimization for shopify store?
[8.04.25, 16:19:15] ~ Zsombor: Hey guys! I have a question regarding facebook. 

So I have multiple stores and some of the stores run on different companies. 

My question is that do I need to have seperate Facebook BMs for the companies, or is it okay to just create different ad account for the different stores/companies. 

The BM would be verified with one of the companies. In the ad accounts I would use different credit cards for the different ad accounts. 

Is this totally okay or facebook will recognize I am using multiple companies’ credit cards inside one BM? And would that be a problem?
[8.04.25, 16:19:46] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Is not a problem. It becomes one if you want to sell any of those stores
[8.04.25, 16:20:12] ~ Alvaro De Prada: But the problem is because you need to sell the BM with the store
[8.04.25, 16:26:39] ~ OB: Why I'll never have a business partner
[8.04.25, 16:28:08] ~ Bazeed: Hey guys, whats the best oneclick upsell app on shopify which is fully customisable?

[8.04.25, 18:35:46] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. 
We had a banger week this last 7 days where we kept increasing budgets and ROAS stayed high, but today where we would have a good amount of orders already, we only have 1 order and conversation dropped to 0.5% where last few weeks it was averaging 3.5%.

Checked funnels and recordings and all seem to be working fine. Any thoughts what to do? Would u cut budgets to limit loss?
[8.04.25, 18:39:15] ~ Yente Dhooge: Cut budget by half, mostly works
[8.04.25, 20:00:37] ~ Charles: could just be a bad day too

[8.04.25, 20:06:03] ~ Max: Microsoft clarity 100% free and does enough for recordings for sure

[8.04.25, 20:53:01] ~ Kyle Twohill: with checkout champ if I have a pre selected subscription at the checkout page. Like a box where its ticked off and describes it will this get me banned on shopify? as shopify is my front end store. I think its against their terms of service is there risk to this?
[8.04.25, 20:56:05] ~ Kyle Twohill: probably should have unchecked yes?

For ex. do you always charge someone again exactly 30 days after they purchase?

[9.04.25, 7:31:52] ~ Mikael: Anyone else saw a drop in sales starting from Monday in sales from meta? Our google is performing super good but Meta dropped in performance starting on Monday.

[9.04.25, 15:56:18] ~ Charles: 75% USA
[9.04.25, 15:56:48] ~ Filippo: I went from 35% profit to -38% overnight
[9.04.25, 15:57:02] ~ Wouter: Why not target Europe?
[9.04.25, 15:57:52] ~ Filippo: if i had a legit brand yeah, but i dont wanna deal with vat for pump and dumps
[9.04.25, 16:01:25] ~ Charles: Every day over the past four months has been profitable for us, until yesterday
[9.04.25, 16:20:20] ~ Growg: I have been seeing tarrif discussion all over the feed but to understand tarrif you need to understand countries GDP and per capita income, so this tarrif BS will just make sure most of store either substantially earn leas profit or simply move to US manufacturers which is indeed costlier. So at current point there is no win win or win loss situation and this will surely end in Tarrif war.

So whatever side you are, just now we need to focus on the funnel leakage to minmize this. 

Thats my overall thought. ‎<This message was edited>

[9.04.25, 16:24:35] ~ Growg: They won’t as China has made their path technically and Economically in last decade. so all the talk about if its good or bad. Its really bad and soon in next 3-4 months if this war doesnot substantiate than most of dropshipping business margin will be less or eventually will get out of the market due to big players using this as benefits

[9.04.25, 17:43:02] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes
[9.04.25, 17:43:12] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Yes. This makes it clean and simple.
[9.04.25, 17:43:35] ~ Filippo: so u have like one holding company and then different LLCs ?
[9.04.25, 17:44:33] ~ Josiah: good for liability protection but doesn’t matter for exit, I used to work for an aggregator and they would only ever buy brand assets never the entity
[9.04.25, 17:45:38] ~ Mike Kasdorf: For optimal tax purposes (US-based), the best way to go is LLC holding/parent Co, and then each brand owned by a c-corp that's in WY, NV, TX, etc.
[9.04.25, 17:47:27] ~ Josiah: regular import tariffs are live as of today, extending to direct or dropship from china de minimis <$800 plan to be eliminated as of May 2, yes so will apply then
[9.04.25, 17:55:50] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hmm, thanks for the info.
[9.04.25, 17:57:08] ~ Mithiran: What are the fees for <$800 de minimis the website isn’t very clear
[9.04.25, 18:00:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: President Trump’s retaliatory tariffs of up to 104% against China are set to go into effect in roughly two hours, at 12:01am EST. Additional measures have also been put in place to prevent companies from circumventing the tariffs, including a 90% or $75 per package tax on all goods coming from China or Hong Kong beginning May 2, 2025 at 12:01am EST, which will then increase to $150 per package on June 1, 2025. These taxes will apply to any goods ordered from China that are transferred by a Chinese national carrier to the U.S. Postal Service, it does not apply to goods which are transported completely by private companies like FEDEX, UPS, or DHL.
[9.04.25, 18:02:33] ~ Josiah: presumably the same as b2b imports which are 104% as of today + potential per order custom processing fees. open question as to if that will be determined on cogs or retail. $75 and $150 charges are for shipments via postal like epacket not private carriers like yunexpress based on our current understanding
[9.04.25, 18:03:53] ~ Mithiran: I’m just confused by the 90% or $75 charge, which one is it? How do they choose it doesn’t say
[9.04.25, 18:04:44] ~ Josiah: whichever is greater
[9.04.25, 18:05:18] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Also what actions are you guys taking over this? I'm really confused as well for now and to be honest I don't have much information from my supplier yet they said the best thing is to wait for now.
‎[9.04.25, 18:06:39] ~ Matthew Martorano: ‎image omitted
[9.04.25, 18:20:16] ~ Josiah: to be honest it's also a waiting game for us, of course there could be a last minute deal but that's in the realm of political speculation - the way it works is that US customs will provide guidance to customs agents who provide it to shippers who provide it to fulfillment operators like us on how it will be implemented.
At the very least I would expect and prepare for the eventuality that B2C shipments from China will be treated the same as B2B for tax tariff purposes - the US isn't going to allow Chinese Amazon sellers Temu Shein etc to have better deal than US importers and retailers who are eating the tariffs now
[9.04.25, 18:21:04] ~ Bryan T: We gotta hope they each up the rate to 500% in 3 days and then are like wtf are we doing and both call it off
[9.04.25, 18:21:45] ~ Josiah: our guidance to clients is run margin scenarios with new inclusive COGS + tariff, and know your HST codes by SKU
[9.04.25, 19:05:26] ~ Bazeed: Anyone has a contact for inbound call center for u.s?
[9.04.25, 20:01:20] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Hey Guys. Apologies for the long message and being a bit MIA in the group. The tariff stuff has been keeping us busy. Here are 10 things we’ve been thinking about and sharing with our clients and we wanted to share it here too in case it’s helpful.

1. No One Knows the "Final" Tariff Details Yet
There’s still no clarity on how high the new tariffs will be — they could be 104%, 129% (still unknown if section 301 is still in place as an FYI), or something else entirely — or how broadly they’ll be applied (just China, or China plus other parts of Asia?). We also don’t know which product categories will be affected or how implementation will roll out. We anticipate uncertainty to continue for the near-future.

2. While Tariff Numbers Are Unclear, Plan for De Minimis to Be Removed
Tariffs may still be TBD, but de minimis removal is looking very likely. This means all shipments into the U.S. under $800 could now be taxed — a big hit to brands relying on direct-from-China fulfillment. And it’s not just about cost: longer delivery times from China could lead to more refund requests, lower customer satisfaction, and fewer repeat purchases — all of which hurt your LTV and CAC efficiency.

3. Work Directly With Factories — Not Just Fulfillment Companies
Fulfillment partners help with logistics, but not your product costs. Good quality factories are very collaborative and will help you come up with ways to reduce your costs by purchasing certain raw materials or buying at certain volumes to help bring down your cost. From our experience, fulfillment and trade companies typically mark up prices by 30%-100+%

4. Consider Hybrid Fulfillment or Fulfillment from the U.S.
Consider taking a hybrid fulfillment model (fulfill from US and China-based warehouse based on location of the customer) or consider fulfilling directly from the US (bulk ship to US 3PL). Yes, tariffs still apply when importing in bulk — but there are ways to consolidate shipment to lower tariff/duty payment. There are 2 benefits - lower per unit fulfillment cost and faster delivery to the customer - which means fewer refund requests, which prevents your CAC from creeping up. 

5. Diversify Market (look beyond US)
Scaling into international markets (like the EU, UK, or Canada) can help offset U.S. margin compression. If you’re currently U.S.-only, you’re more exposed to changes in domestic logistics and trade policy.

6. Diversity Manufacturing (Where Numbers work out)
Diversifying doesn’t mean ditching China — it means adding a second factory base (like the U.S., Mexico, or Europe) for flexibility and regional fulfillment. This doesn’t apply for every industry, but for some industries like skincare and supplements, this is very doable. This can significantly bring down your cost due to the tariffs. That said, this is NOT a guarantee b/c of the changing policies. Manufacturing costs in the US are increasing due to greater demand and their reliance on China for ingredients and machines. 
-If you're targeting Europe, Australia, etc. you’ll need to still produce in China since the numbers make sense. 
-Anyone thats selling gadgets will still need to produce in China since the US is not set up properly, nor is it even cost effective to produce gadgets. If you sell apparel, you can explore working with other countries since they’re more competitive than China on price. 
(We’ve been working with a lot of skincare and supplements brands to set up U.S. production and making sure it makes sense economically— you'll need to carefully compare total landed cost, not just per-unit price.)

7. There’s No One-Size-Fits-All Strategy — You Need to carefully compare numbers
Every brand is different. What works for a $60 skincare serum won’t work for a $20 phone charger. A lot of what we've been doing with brands is to help them figure out steps 4-6 (fulfillment strategy, target market and manufacturing strategy) to optimize for cost and on-time fulfillment.  Make decisions based on your numbers — not someone else’s playbook. 

8. Review and Optimize Your HTS Codes to reduce cost
While the tariffs are applied across all product categories, they are not the same when it comes to duties. Sometimes an HTS code for a product falls under two HTS codes. One could be a common HTS code used for the exact product, but another could be used due to the products function. In some cases, like we’ve seen in the past, the difference in duties can be in range of 6%. If you’re importing large volumes of product into the US, the duties savings can be significant. 

9. Negotiate Better Payment Terms With Manufacturers
For those that have an established relationship with their manufacturer, try working on paying a 20% deposit for your order. Then paying 50% upon completion of production and paying the final 30% 30 days after delivery. If you’re placing orders valued at $300k, for instance, that’s $90k of money freed up for a month that you can put into marketing and scaling up your business. 

10. Smaller Dropshipping Brands Are Most at Risk; opportunity for medium-large brands.
Smaller businesses, especially pure dropshipping businesses (that are not focused on building a brand and scaling) are most likely going to die out with the de minimus removal. They'll have to pivot to selling in other markets, such as the EU, UK, Canada and Austrailia. This is a tough period for everyone, but could allow 8-9 figure brands to gain more market share in the US in the long term. This of course hinges on them having good control over cashflow and production cost. 

Hope this is helpful and stay strong everyone. Hit me up if I can be helpful with anything. I’m also going to be doing a live call with @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ tomorrow to talk about this stuff.

[9.04.25, 23:10:54] ~ Yusuf: i haven't questioned reasoning too much but mainly we are considering a tool that also automates customer support workflow a bit such as integrating suppliers and having conversation threads on order numbers, etc.

[10.04.25, 5:40:20] ~ Mithiran: personally i dont like adding in minimum spend into a CBO cause it messes it up. I just move it into a seperate CBO
[10.04.25, 5:48:33] ~ Guy Edan: Thanks! If there’s a winner in the new CBO, do you transfer it to the main CBO or keep it there and keep opening new CBOs for new creatives?
[10.04.25, 5:57:13] ~ Mithiran: I just keep it in the new CBO, used to do one campaign but it wasn’t working out for us. So I took all the ad sets that weren’t spending and put it in new campaigns and most are working really well. Just have to be careful on bad tests and cut them quickly cause they can burn a lot of money

[11.04.25, 0:53:58] ~ AJ: Is that an easier solution than opening german company?
[11.04.25, 1:03:40] ~ Mike Ramsey: In most cases, yes.   You will need to have POC in that market to get an MOR solution however.  It is not for testing.
[11.04.25, 1:10:47] ~ Bretten Hadley: Could a virtual office suffice as a POC? @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩

[11.04.25, 2:30:19] China Bigboss: hey bro they will make under thier name or under you name does it include company setup in HK ?
[11.04.25, 2:31:53] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: No it doesn't  include hk company because I already have it but i see at Ocean payments website they also charge around a 1000$ in fees for setup, also they promise me to add in a groupchat with insider reps of ocean payments on whatsapp.

[11.04.25, 6:06:26] ~ Mikael: Is it beneficial to have US LLC on a Nominee? or is it just better to have it on your own name?
[11.04.25, 7:38:41] ~ Jonny: Anyone seeing terrible META performance the past 2 days?
[11.04.25, 9:09:32] ~ Mikael: since Monday. but thursday was better so far. Monday-wednesday was shit. This was same on all our stores

[11.04.25, 15:55:40] Carlos Leeseman: When you want to grow organic, want to become more engaging with your fans, etc
[11.04.25, 15:56:32] Topi: Thats so broad question its impossible to give good advice
[11.04.25, 15:56:35] Topi: But if youre dropshipping
[11.04.25, 15:56:36] Topi: Never
[11.04.25, 15:58:48] Carlos Leeseman: I think it’s nice when you have a big follow base. Then it’s important to post daily stories, giveaways, etc. 

But agree, if you do dropshipping, is waste of time and money
[11.04.25, 16:38:24] ~ Musawer: Anyone using softwares for creating surveys at funnelish?
[11.04.25, 17:26:28] ~ Guy Edan: I’m curious, why not if you’re drop-shipping branded products? (Or is the assumption that it’s not branded)
[11.04.25, 17:40:52] Carlos Leeseman: As dropshipper you’re often not focused on creating a fan base, long term relationships, returning customers, etc
[11.04.25, 18:02:15] ~ Alexander Sundström: We have customized all products, but yes, we do dropshipping.
[11.04.25, 18:21:29] ~ Moonis Ali: When you want to turn your regular store into a brand with loyal customers. It helps in building a community and getting organic sales

[12.04.25, 4:18:31] ~ Mo: Im using 2 HK paypal accounts ( to disperse my funds, and not have all in one acct) , tried creating a 3rd acct but got terminated couple of days after. Anyone using multiple HK accounts ? do u experience same issue ?
[12.04.25, 6:45:17] ~ Mithiran: We pay hourly, $30 USD per hr it’s way more cost effective and u can get 10x the amount of footage

[12.04.25, 10:21:01] ~ Zsombor: Well that could be the problem no? I think 2 paypals under the same structure is the max
[12.04.25, 10:26:48] ~ Mithiran: How do you guys keep track of whether your 3PL actually ships all orders? Sometimes we go out of stock, and the 3PL say they shipped everything once it's in stock, but I still see some unfulfilled orders in Shopify. 

I was thinking of doing a weekly report of unfulfilled orders and tagging them to track, but is there a better way to do this?
[12.04.25, 10:34:10] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: We do daily report of unfulfilled orders, so everythings on track
[12.04.25, 10:40:06] ~ Mithiran: Are you mainly just checking what’s unfulfilled each day and then asking the 3PL why those ones haven’t gone out yet? Or is there other things to track
[12.04.25, 10:47:44] ~ Mo: I dont know tbh
[12.04.25, 22:23:17] ~ OB: Looking for one too
[12.04.25, 22:39:09] ~ Brett Fallarino: @⁨~Bazeed⁩ @⁨~OB⁩ My email guy’s a beast. I’m sure he most-likely has time for 1-2 more clients if you want. We recently lowered his hours bc we’re prioritizing more front-end customer acquisition for our biz model. So want to make sure he still has work
[12.04.25, 22:54:22] ~ Kyle Twohill: Anyone running a vip members store? I have a few questions about it looking for someone who has done that before
[12.04.25, 22:56:53] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I saw some stores doing that too, that's considered in grey hat no?
[12.04.25, 22:57:03] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Those brands are actually exitable?
[12.04.25, 23:18:50] ~ Davide: anyone is using https://akool.com/? ‎<This message was edited>
[12.04.25, 23:40:58] ~ Henry: Hey guys, wanted to ask for advice since we are scaling to other Big 5 countries outside of US. How do you deal with returns in countries you don’t live in? I’ve basically been having my US customer send returns to my home address because I live in US so that is easily covered. Not sure about other markets tho
[12.04.25, 23:42:27] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you clearly show that are a US store. Just tell them they need to ship to US address
[12.04.25, 23:42:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Europeans are sort of used to it when the store is in english
[12.04.25, 23:48:07] ~ Henry: Wow really? What about Aus and NZ if you know?
[12.04.25, 23:49:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Same thing. Just put your US address on the footer
[12.04.25, 23:49:33] ~ Alvaro De Prada: so they "should know" that you are a us store
[12.04.25, 23:49:55] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can also say, you can ship to our warehouse in USA or in China which is tecnically closer to them
[12.04.25, 23:49:58] ~ Alvaro De Prada: and let them decide
[12.04.25, 23:51:37] ~ Brett Fallarino: You can also offer them the option to keep the product for 50% refund to lessen returns if they get upset about the US Return option
[12.04.25, 23:54:26] ~ Max: We set up an anytime mailbox address in prague. Most customers don’t end up actually going thru the hassle of returning but depends on your product price and shipping costs
[13.04.25, 3:00:12] ~ Phil: To anyone using airwallex. Did you guys have a problem activating apple pay from shopifys end at all. It wont let me save apple pay as a payment option. Looked into it and apparently shopify have to unblock us from their end which is what Ive been told by airwallex support. Ive now opened a 4th ticket now and they always give the generic message “Our internal team will have a look into this and get back to you via email” Its pretty much been 2 weeks and 4 live chats later and they still have not gotten back to me. If anyone has had this issue and got it resolved please let me know!
[13.04.25, 5:03:43] ~ Mo: i had some winning VSLs but got rejected, tweaked them to be compliant, but they are not as performing as the others. thinking abt hosting the VSL in my landing page , i see some brands doing same ( where they go a bit harder) . Would you recommend that ? any workarounds ?
[13.04.25, 7:02:09] ~ Phil: hey guys, does anyone have a standard theme they use for testing beauty products. Just want a theme that has everything on it thats needed to convert and enough on it to test and all I will have to do is change the info to fit the testing product then can optimize later when its proven. Any one thats able to send or know a good theme i can buy lmk please
[13.04.25, 7:43:49] ~ Mithiran: Has anyone split tested increasing prices for different variants? Our products cost more as they increase in size but we have one selling price for all
[13.04.25, 9:02:39] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I use Dawn with Sections app
[13.04.25, 9:06:25] ~ Ry: How do u guys handle wholesale enquiries?
[13.04.25, 9:32:30] ~ Moonis Ali: Yes I have You should definitely test different prices for different sizes
[13.04.25, 11:27:10] ~ Nal: Definitely worth the test bro
[13.04.25, 20:09:39] ~ Tijn Fortuin: Having an general google-fashion dropship store for sale, very good price! Pb if you are intrested
[13.04.25, 20:14:25] ~ Filippo: For guys building high quality brands with long term vision:
What are your thoughts regarding the following: cheap dropshippers "putting pressure" so you can't focus on improving the product cause they will scale faster with a crap product ‎<This message was edited>
[13.04.25, 20:33:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Crap products don’t last
[13.04.25, 20:33:45] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Just focus on yourself and your product and try to improve it the best you can
[13.04.25, 20:36:21] ~ Filippo: you dont think someone running a cheap version of your product is going to kill the market ?
[13.04.25, 20:36:36] ~ Filippo: assuming theyre running ads you dont cause ure working on the product
[13.04.25, 20:38:31] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you are developing the next Vaginal gummy bear you might have sort on an issue but not because of cheap dropshippers but established brands.

If you are solving a problem, there will always be new people with the problem. 

@⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ has scaled products that were more “saturated” than the back corrector in 2018
[13.04.25, 20:39:09] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you have a new angle or new mechanism of the product, you are good to go. Don’t worry about dropshippers too much unless they are ripping your creatives
[13.04.25, 20:54:19] ~ Filippo: Im talking more like weighted blanket , people start selling it, then you launch a better high quality brand
[13.04.25, 20:55:09] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You aren’t new to the party. Amazing brands out there selling it. If you can handle the CAC and yours is amazing… I wouldn’t worry about dropshippers but the quality brands
[13.04.25, 20:55:34] ~ Filippo: That was just an example
[13.04.25, 20:55:40] ~ Filippo: Great
[13.04.25, 20:56:17] ~ Filippo: Cause if your product is not a serum, cream, or a pill, the mechanism will always be one for the product , like the weighted blanket
[13.04.25, 20:57:16] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah but you can sell them to babies, kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, couples, queers, gays, trans ecc
[13.04.25, 20:57:24] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Each has its own angle
[13.04.25, 20:57:56] ~ Alvaro De Prada: So out of one product I got 9 brands you can launch. And I didn’t start with animals
‎[13.04.25, 20:58:43] ~ K: ‎GIF omitted
[13.04.25, 20:59:57] ~ Filippo: Yes 100%, I was just strictly talking regarding having people selling to same customers as I plan to
[13.04.25, 21:00:35] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I know what you mean. I just say… be better at something that they are not
[13.04.25, 21:00:46] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Don’t overthink it
[13.04.25, 21:01:01] ~ Filippo: Im a pro at that ‎<This message was edited>
[13.04.25, 21:01:31] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Welcome to the club 😂
[13.04.25, 22:00:27] ~ Brett Fallarino: This is key 🔑 Learn from the industry leaders and reverse engineer why they earned their spot. Don’t overthink the little stuff. While you’re worried, they’re working @⁨~Filippo⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[13.04.25, 22:02:58] ~ Brett Fallarino: There will always be competition and people copying/ripping you.

If you have better unit economics, better offer, more authority, better systems, more capital, better team, etc. you will simply outlast them. Play the long-term game and pay these little players (who copy you) no attention. Now if someone is a serious threat to your biz, game-on. The better team will win ‎<This message was edited>
[13.04.25, 22:20:27] ~ Jeb: Make a wholesale shopify store and have them fill out an inquiry before they can log into it and see your wholesale prices
[14.04.25, 0:38:09] ~ Patrycja: Hi everyone, does anyone know a good in house email marketing person? We currently use an agency and it’s not working for us anymore
[14.04.25, 1:41:14] ~ OB: Had the exact same issue. Took 10 chats to get it sorted. It's just a waiting game it took 3 weeks to get sorted ‎<This message was edited>
[14.04.25, 4:30:08] ~ Mo: i have a long voice over , and id like to split it into small sentences, is there a tool that help with that ?
[14.04.25, 10:18:59] ~ DD: hey bro, chats with shopify or airwallex? issue is about domain verification to enable apple pay, shopify tells me there is nothing they can do ‎<This message was edited>
[14.04.25, 10:19:50] ~ Phil: Okay as long as it got sorted. Now I got some hope. Appreciate you getting back to me
[14.04.25, 10:39:17] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If I’m not mistaken CapCut can do that automatically
[14.04.25, 11:33:41] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Hey guys I’m sure someone here has dealt with uploaded ads stuck at 0% and then takes hours and hours to get to like 20-30% uploaded, anyone have a solution for this? I’ll wise someone $100 straight away if they have any idea getting sick of this lmao
[14.04.25, 11:40:01] ~ Phil: Happened to me when my internet was shit 🤣
[14.04.25, 11:40:10] ~ Phil: I had no choice but to wait ahaha
[14.04.25, 11:40:34] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Does it have something to do with servers?
[14.04.25, 11:40:38] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Or any thing else
[14.04.25, 11:40:57] ~ Phil: I’m not sure tbh. We got our internet box changed after months and that fixed the issue bro
[14.04.25, 11:41:13] ~ Phil: So I think mine was just a wifi issue
[14.04.25, 11:41:17] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: What if it’s just stuck at 0?
[14.04.25, 11:41:22] ~ Phil: But waited ages even just for images to load
[14.04.25, 11:41:24] ~ Phil: Yes sometimes
[14.04.25, 11:41:42] ~ Phil: I was refreshing the ads manager etc
[14.04.25, 11:41:46] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Is there anything else you recommend this is getting ridiculous
[14.04.25, 11:41:57] ~ Phil: Have you reset the ads manager?
[14.04.25, 11:42:18] ~ Phil: Or tried different wifi to see if its your connection ‎<This message was edited>
[14.04.25, 11:43:07] ~ Mithiran: Go here https://business.facebook.com/asset_library/business_creatives/ upload the file and name it properly, then when you're in adsmanager you can search the name and it comes up when your in the upload creative section. you can upload multiple creatives at a time through that folder as well
[14.04.25, 11:51:23] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: I see even this didn’t work + internet is very fast
[14.04.25, 11:51:36] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: we r running through a proxy could it be that ?
[14.04.25, 11:55:21] ~ Rustam: bro, I had a similar issue. Ads wouldn’t upload and I would receive an error. I just gave it some time, then refreshed the adsmanager. The ads were already uploaded. Some kind of bug. Maybe you have this too?
[14.04.25, 11:58:34] ~ Mithiran: how longs the videos?
[14.04.25, 11:58:48] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Like a minute
[14.04.25, 11:59:21] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: It’s been 3 days lol
[14.04.25, 12:00:51] ~ Adam K.: its first thing to check/replace with such issue. Try to upload video with any profile not using proxy and then you have an answer where to dig deeper :)
[14.04.25, 12:23:23] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: 🐐
[14.04.25, 12:23:45] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: So I used my a profile with no proxy and upload speed was fine, if anyone ever dealt with this, this is the solution
[14.04.25, 12:36:14] ~ Gideon: Maybe remove cache/cookies
[14.04.25, 12:46:16] ~ Jonny: anyone used a translation app like weglot or shopify translate app?
[14.04.25, 12:47:31] ~ Jonny: anyone seen an uplift in CVR using shopify plus checkout?
[14.04.25, 12:48:57] ~ Mason Schulze: Tried it for a while and added trust badges, guarantee + a review but saw a decline in CVR
[14.04.25, 12:49:40] Fabian: Yes
[14.04.25, 12:51:25] ~ RakanGammoh: I’ve tried them all .. LangShop has been the best option so far.
[14.04.25, 12:53:03] ~ Jonny: thanks
[14.04.25, 12:53:10] ~ Jonny: whats the best split test app in shopify?
[14.04.25, 12:53:22] ~ Jonny: we've used visually In the past, its decent but not amazing
[14.04.25, 12:55:38] ~ Cocow😈: Try this

https://business.facebook.com/asset_library/ad_accounts

Choose the right ad account, then upload or images or videos in bulk

Works really well for me and simple, then you can search ads easily when choosing assets in ad manager. 

If first upload does not do anything, then just cancel and do it again it will work
[14.04.25, 15:16:04] ~ Guy Edan: That’s a good idea. Will suggest that
[14.04.25, 15:20:51] ~ Cocow😈: May I ask you where you source this content ? Backstage ? Thanks
[14.04.25, 18:12:10] ~ Mithiran: Yeah backstage, make sure to sell them on how it’s a long term project, how it’s not just a couple hours of work. Cause some actors are hesitant at the price
[14.04.25, 20:57:36] ~ Nils: yo! anyone know someone that can take down reddit threads?
[14.04.25, 21:46:27] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Dmed u
[14.04.25, 22:24:57] ~ Cocow😈: Ok thanks mate
[15.04.25, 6:01:15] ~ Aaron Ware: Anyone had domain and events blocked by meta?
[15.04.25, 11:14:34] ~ Michael: Hey guys what's the easiest way to open a new PayPal account with LLc as non resident without itin number?
[15.04.25, 11:15:02] ~ OB: You can't event with ITIN
[15.04.25, 11:22:29] ~ Michael: What's the easiest way to solve that ?
[15.04.25, 11:24:28] ~ Filippo: why?
[15.04.25, 11:24:56] ~ Filippo: by the way, something strange is happening on my US store, now 70% of my sales are from paypal
[15.04.25, 11:25:04] ~ Filippo: used to be 70% credit card
[15.04.25, 11:25:14] ~ Felix: Does anyone have a tracking expert in here?
A person that can set up custom serverside tracking, etc.
[15.04.25, 11:26:58] Topi: I know ex meta tracking engineer
[15.04.25, 11:27:15] Topi: not sure if its for your needs but feel free to dm
[15.04.25, 11:29:02] Carlos Leeseman: We are testing Aimerce at the moment. They offer 30 day free trial and they are great CAPI solution at the moment for businesses that are affected with the new health restrictions. They offer custom events with pretty good results what we’ve seen, but we will see. Will send update later this week how it goes for us. ‎<This message was edited>
[15.04.25, 11:31:20] ~ Felix: Sadly not, more about overall tracking -> Outbrain, Taboola, gAds and Meta

But thank you!
[15.04.25, 11:34:43] Carlos Leeseman: They also offer Funnelish tracking and a third-party cookie extension.

Normally, Klaviyo's flows, like browse and abandon cart flows, only work for up to 7 days, based on the standard cookie tracking window. But with Aimerce’s CAPI solution, they extend this cookie lifespan significantly, sometimes even up to several months or a full year.

This extended tracking period ensures that more of your site visitors can be identified and retargeted by Klaviyo, even long after their initial visit. It's especially powerful for improving the performance of your browse and abandon cart flows. So this can add huge extra revenue to your flows. ‎<This message was edited>

[15.04.25, 11:36:21] ~ Bazeed: hey guys, can anyone recommend an app where you can fully customise the cart drawer inside shopify

thanks
[15.04.25, 11:36:40] ~ Bazeed: yes dm
[15.04.25, 11:36:41] Carlos Leeseman: Upcart
[15.04.25, 11:36:48] ~ Bazeed: Thanks man
[15.04.25, 12:08:04] ~ OB: I opened one with ITIN got shut down in less than a week, called paypal, they said I have to be US citizen ‎<This message was edited>
[15.04.25, 12:20:59] ~ Bony Ghadiya: I have a couple PayPal accounts and all of them I created using ITIN

Same with Stripe, I have like over a dozen

Or HK paypal - alternative

You can also go for private payment providers if none of those options work for you. 

Payment processors is an easy problem to solve fr

[15.04.25, 13:34:06] ~ Jonny: anyone here got a recommendation for an agency/freelancer that helps get set up on amazon us?
[15.04.25, 13:36:53] ~ Bazeed: For people with foreign based us llcs here, do you have to file the taxes which are on 15apr as the deadline?
[15.04.25, 13:39:44] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes
[15.04.25, 13:58:06] ~ Jonny: we're trying to set up our brand on amazon US market but can see a Chinese seller has used our brand name and product name, we able to report to amazon even though we don't sell on the platform yet?
[15.04.25, 13:59:01] ~ Nebil: Going through the same thing, we added a slight variation to our name and are working on legally getting them removed. I don’t think Amazon will be much help
[15.04.25, 13:59:33] ~ Nebil: It’s most likely still “pending” but it makes it unusable
[15.04.25, 15:08:39] Alex  Fedotoff: good evening good morning legends
[15.04.25, 15:09:04] Alex  Fedotoff: recently broke down amazing hair loss VSL on twitter, few people loved it
[15.04.25, 15:09:28] Alex  Fedotoff: if you guys haven’t seen it please check it out here and use for your VSL ads: https://x.com/FedotOff90/status/1910327765611463043
[15.04.25, 17:50:06] ~ Mithiran: hey guys at what chargeback rate does stripe hold your money?
[15.04.25, 20:27:48] ~ Guy Edan: Hey good people.
For those of you who use funnelish, how do you go about Klaviyo email flows?

For example, they abandoned cart, do you use a trigger that sends them to the Shopify checkout (comfortable and easy integration/trigger), or do you manually put the funnel checkout URL? ‎<This message was edited>
[15.04.25, 20:50:29] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Is there a link somewhere to the actual VSL? That would be great to see.
[15.04.25, 21:17:33] ~ Cody Chaffee: My google performance is tanking because of some copycats that are running defamation ads, ripping my product and putting it up at a lower price, etc. Does anyone have a solution?
[15.04.25, 21:21:33] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Dmca, lawsuits
[15.04.25, 21:31:16] ~ Mike Ramsey: Not necessarily a rate where it auto triggers shutdown as it greatly depends on your region, product, scaling percentages month over month and overall online feedback.  

1% or above is considered high risk threshold but based on patterns recently with Stripe, .75 is probably threshold if less than 6 month old account
[15.04.25, 21:37:00] ~ Mike Ramsey: I just had a client come to me doing 1.5M per month on less than 6 month old brand who had chargeback alerts and rate was below .60% and they were triggered with 25% reserve due to high refund rate exceeding 10%.

They had aggressive upsells and funnel so even high refund rates trigger reserves / shut downs.  Have to manage both pieces here and not just look at CB rate only.  Alerts cannot be a blanket ‘catch all’ for disputes - need to focus on customer experience above all else and the numbers will be in your favor.
[15.04.25, 21:40:16] ~ Shri Kanase: Change your product image, easiest way to do this if you have limited resources is to flip the product in the image
[15.04.25, 21:40:35] ~ Shri Kanase: Can be done via canva, increases CTR by having your ad stand out. Not long term solution but good for now
[16.04.25, 2:01:18] ~ Henry: Hey guys, I’m looking to expand my brand into doing PR articles on magazines to get that “as seen on…” badge on my website. Does anyone know any contacts to get this done?
[16.04.25, 2:42:57] ~ Mike Kasdorf: really strong day on Meta today. All campaigns except 2 are between 3x and 6x ROAS. Anyone else seeing this?
[16.04.25, 2:56:51] ~ Steve: Run ads on native to those networks. Then put the banner "Ads Seen On:" instead of "As Seen On"
[16.04.25, 4:58:50] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Really? How long have you been running for? And is it converting the same still?
[16.04.25, 4:59:47] ~ Phil: Metrics are really good today for me too. Getting like $9-$12 CPMS
[16.04.25, 5:59:19] ~ DD: hey, anyone spending 500k/mo+ on meta and actually using “agency” ad accounts?
[16.04.25, 6:02:40] Topi: Not sure what “actually” here means but yes for sure
[16.04.25, 6:03:24] ~ DD: why not using your own ad accounts?
[16.04.25, 6:05:03] Topi: Found good accounts just been scaling with them, no bigger reason. Time to time we test against our own accounts but we don’t see any difference in performance
[16.04.25, 6:08:02] ~ DD: what % your paying if I may ask?
[16.04.25, 6:08:47] Topi: very low
[16.04.25, 7:54:51] ~ Aaron Ware: 3%
[16.04.25, 7:56:31] ~ DD: sounds a lot
[16.04.25, 7:56:53] ~ DD: do you see less ad rejections, any benefits?
[16.04.25, 7:56:54] ~ Aaron Ware: What you paying
[16.04.25, 7:57:04] ~ DD: I am using our own BM accounts
[16.04.25, 7:57:17] ~ Aaron Ware: Some charge 5%
[16.04.25, 7:57:49] ~ Aaron Ware: I’ve tried a few different ones. They are stronger and better cpm
[16.04.25, 7:58:09] ~ Aaron Ware: Some have been no better sometimes not worth the hassle
[16.04.25, 7:59:00] ~ DD: I think lower CPM is a myth. its all about auction and your ads. imagine meta creating specific “cpm lower systems” for certain BM’s just to earn less
[16.04.25, 8:04:16] ~ Wouter: Anyone got the notification from the 3pl that from 20april the shipping companies will start charging the 140%?
[16.04.25, 8:23:38] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Shameless plug!

If anyone wants to test out premium agency accounts we're running this offer:

First 3k spend no fees

Then 199/month and 2% fee up to 60k spend
After 60k spend is 1500/month and 1% fee of spend

This offer is only for dark lords💪 hit up @⁨~Andrew⁩ for more info 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ‎<This message was edited>
[16.04.25, 8:24:51] ~ DD: can attach our own CC?
[16.04.25, 8:36:34] ~ Aaron Ware: Have you tested it?
[16.04.25, 8:39:19] ~ Aaron Ware: Every single ad account is different and unique
[16.04.25, 8:39:48] ~ DD: Exactly
[16.04.25, 9:00:03] ~ Bazeed: Bestfulfil?
[16.04.25, 9:00:05] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Hey @⁨~DD⁩! Great question, right now we stopped allowing credit cards on the BMs we provide because we’ve seen it cause too many stability issues that affect ad performance and constant payment issues... Our focus is on giving you accounts that are super stable and built to scale hard without those headaches
[16.04.25, 9:01:50] ~ Bazeed: why not use bestfulfill, i think they dont charge any fee on their ad accounts
[16.04.25, 9:07:14] ~ DD: then you lose cashback on the adspend
[16.04.25, 9:11:32] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Totally get you @⁨~DD⁩ correct, you do lose out on cashback, that’s 100% true... but we’ve found that trying to squeeze out cashback often leads to way bigger issues, disapproved payments, random BM shutdowns, unstable ad delivery... we’d rather give you peace of mind with stable BMs that can scale hard without surprises and good performance…

At scale, the ROI from consistent performance and fewer account issues far outweighs the cashback trade-off... we’ve seen it firsthand with our clients. You can’t scale broken setups, right?
[16.04.25, 9:14:35] ~ Mo: I see cheaper metrics cpc, cpm ( 50% cheaper ) and higher ctr when running same ads to funnelish vs shopify , anyone have an idea why ?
[16.04.25, 9:37:09] ~ Damjan Topalovic: same thoughts here
[16.04.25, 9:54:46] ~ Jeremy Khattar: More than happy for anyone to come try our Ronin free of charge as well to have a benchmark and comparison of accounts on performance - no fees, no risks, just come test
[16.04.25, 9:55:10] ~ Jeremy Khattar: if you guys are happy my team would be more than willing to go above and beyond and make sure the performance supersede any fees charged
[16.04.25, 11:35:29] ~ Alexander Sundström: What is the best way of getting selfies from customers using your product and video testimonials? We have been trying to request this by giving a discount code, but with very little success
[16.04.25, 11:36:23] ~ Mason Schulze: Give them a full refund works a charm
[16.04.25, 11:36:26] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Try % cashback
[16.04.25, 11:38:24] ~ Alexander Sundström: Thanks! Our aov is 150 usd, maybe we are being cheap on this, but would you say it is worth it still? Some customers have orders for 300-400 usd.
[16.04.25, 11:39:15] ~ Mason Schulze: Give them even 50% and they would do it for sure
[16.04.25, 11:39:25] ~ Mason Schulze: They won't say no to cash back
[16.04.25, 11:39:39] ~ Alexander Sundström: Haha, thanks man! I appreciate that
[16.04.25, 11:39:42] ~ Mason Schulze: May aswell get TP review at same time
[16.04.25, 13:11:45] ~ Jonny: Hi guys, can anyone recommend a good payment processor that has a very good acceptance rate ?

[16.04.25, 15:43:35] ~ Nicolò: hi guys, does anyone know a good way to do dmca on the creatives that my competitors stole from me?
[16.04.25, 15:44:23] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: try adyen is best if u r doing huge volume

If anyone else is interested, dm me
[16.04.25, 16:43:03] ~ Matt: For anyone on meta invoicing how quickly do they shut your acc off if you don’t pay it on due date?
[16.04.25, 16:43:11] ~ Matt: Google is 25 days after it’s actually due

[16.04.25, 17:18:16] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: That's true. But i am a little worried because my current supplier is a nerd with no other warehouse than China. And this is my first and only brand so I was stressing a bit
[16.04.25, 17:18:38] ~ Rick: and?
[16.04.25, 17:18:46] ~ Rick: change supplier 🤣
[16.04.25, 17:19:15] ~ Rick: you have to add "for now"
[16.04.25, 17:19:21] ~ Rick: keep pushing bro
[16.04.25, 17:20:02] ~ Rick: don't create mental barriers
[16.04.25, 17:20:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yes you're definitely right I am unnecessarily stressing.
[16.04.25, 17:20:15] ~ Rick: trust me
[16.04.25, 17:20:21] ~ Rick: i was like you

[16.04.25, 21:17:41] ~ Guy Edan: How do you guys go about iterating winners?

We had a big 40 sec video winner we found 2 weeks ago, tested at least 10-15 different iterations on it (changing the first 10 seconds mostly) and they all flopped.
[16.04.25, 21:22:48] ~ Bazeed: hey guys. if you launch a vsl with 10-15 hooks each, would you launch all in 1 adset or divide it into 2 adsets for giving enough spend opportunity to each?
[16.04.25, 21:41:03] Carlos Leeseman: Launch 1 VSL with 10-15 hooks? I think that’s too much. We always do 3 hooks with 3 visual scrollstoppers per hook. So that’s in total 9 ads. This is good enough to validate a VSL.

Each hook gets 1 adset with a budget of your breakeven CPA. That’s how we normally do it.
[16.04.25, 21:46:40] ~ Jeremy Khattar: in case everyone is seeing better cpms - here’s why

They purchased my domain with a different extension, copied the entire website and left my details on the website.

So now I’m getting their customers complaining to me 😂

[17.04.25, 11:17:45] ~ Rick: do you have an agency for this? or all in house?

[17.04.25, 16:48:01] ~ Gustavo Drumm: I had great results surf scalling in the past by doubling budgets every 1-2h. But now the performance absolutely tanks. How much are you guys increasing without seeing a big increase in CPA? ‎<This message was edited>
[17.04.25, 18:07:56] ~ J: Hey guys, we’ve received a ban on our HK PayPal account since yesterday and we’re trying to figure out what our options are.
	1.	Is there any way to appeal or lift the ban?
	2.	Is it possible to open a new PayPal account under the same company?
	3.	Or would we need to set up an entirely new company to be able to use PayPal again?
Appreciate any input!
[17.04.25, 18:08:44] ~ Vish: @⁨~J⁩ do you have connection with the reps?
[17.04.25, 18:08:54] ~ Vish: You can not open new one, it will be banned straight away
[17.04.25, 18:09:32] ~ Vish: So either rep connection could help or new company under some nominee and then paypal
[17.04.25, 18:09:39] ~ Vish: First figure out why it was banned
[17.04.25, 18:13:54] ~ J: That’s the problem, they havn’t told us why we got the ban and the reps just said they can’t help us with this for some reason. @⁨~Vish⁩
[17.04.25, 18:14:30] ~ Zsombor: We had the same before. Was your chargeback rate high?
[17.04.25, 18:14:54] ~ Antonio Celani: you cannot use same ibo, you need a new setup
[17.04.25, 18:20:54] ~ J: Was a new company we where only live for a week. We wanted to respond to our first chargeback and got told that we where blocked
[17.04.25, 18:21:33] ~ Vish: Naah, your rep is garbage in that case
[17.04.25, 18:21:47] ~ Vish: Because one chargeback wouldn't lead to suspension
[17.04.25, 18:22:15] ~ Vish: Either you have too many open cases as well or something else is wrong
[17.04.25, 18:24:07] ~ J: Would say the same
[17.04.25, 18:24:35] ~ Vish: DM, I will connect you with someone
[17.04.25, 18:24:55] ~ Zsombor: who is your rep? ours sucked as well lol
[17.04.25, 18:25:22] ~ Vish: I have couple of guys
[17.04.25, 18:26:24] ~ Zsombor: Can you connect me too? Thanks bro
[17.04.25, 18:26:43] ~ Vish: Sure, what is your reps name though?
[17.04.25, 18:29:30] ~ Damjan Topalovic: got a problem guys

when an order goes through in funnelish my payment is captured through stripe but no notification or order creation on the shopify side. started happening like 2 days ago.

any ideas?
[17.04.25, 18:30:05] ~ Rick: do you change the product? in connected in the right way?
[17.04.25, 18:30:21] ~ Damjan Topalovic: everythig connected perfectly
[17.04.25, 18:30:39] ~ Rick: you already try to disconect the store and reconnect it?
[17.04.25, 18:31:12] ~ Damjan Topalovic: when i go check the order in funnelish it says ‘’shopify create order failed, shopify returned an error’’
[17.04.25, 18:31:17] ~ Damjan Topalovic: yep
[17.04.25, 18:31:48] ~ Rick: strange
[17.04.25, 18:35:01] ~ Guy Edan: Does anyone have a upsell advertorial template they can share?
[17.04.25, 18:35:06] ~ Mithiran: Crazy, same thing happened for me with Lightfunnels also 2 days ago. Could be a change in Shopify API which caused all the 3rd party checkouts to go wrong?
[17.04.25, 18:35:56] ~ Filippo: Yes, happened to me for a few orders, funnelish support said it was Shopify problem
[17.04.25, 18:36:17] ~ Damjan Topalovic: how did u solve?
[17.04.25, 18:36:21] ~ Filippo: Nothing
[17.04.25, 18:36:29] ~ Mithiran: I reached out to lightfunnels devs and they fixed it. There's still some other issues but theyre getting it done
[17.04.25, 18:36:33] ~ Filippo: Didn’t happen again
[17.04.25, 18:36:39] ~ Damjan Topalovic: how long did it last?
[17.04.25, 18:36:54] ~ Filippo: Only one order
[17.04.25, 18:37:07] ~ Filippo: But it I did see this with another store I had 3 weeks ago
[17.04.25, 18:37:11] ~ Filippo: For like 4 orders
[17.04.25, 18:40:36] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: It has happened to me, try deleting and downloading Shopify app again and it would work. Even when everything is perfect the chaching wouldn't work ‎<This message was edited>

[17.04.25, 19:41:44] Topi: yes going, its cool but I’d say have intention why you go there

[17.04.25, 20:57:12] ~ M A N U E L: I think is a facebook bug tbh
[17.04.25, 22:15:24] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, what is your experience with facebook Advantage+ creative enhancements? By default a lot of things are on, but we’re always turn off everything.

Are there specific enhancements that actually are helpful for better performance or engagement?

[17.04.25, 23:27:18] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Anyone here got a TikTok account manager or agency they'd recommend?
[18.04.25, 2:32:51] ~ Christopher Murphy: Having a cpm issue in one of my accounts - seeing $200+ CPM.

I’ve been told countless times that CPM doesn’t matter. But I did a Meta spy on our competitor that sells same product to the same audience and they get a $25 cpm.

Any clue how to fix this?
[18.04.25, 2:38:15] ~ Nico: you may have shadow penalties
[18.04.25, 2:38:24] ~ Nico: try other ad acc aswell
[18.04.25, 2:45:32] ~ Phil: CPM does matter in my opinion. Cheaper traffic defs makes a massive difference
[18.04.25, 2:56:08] ~ Christopher Murphy: Yea lol, especially when competitor is getting 10x cheaper traffic than me😅
[18.04.25, 2:57:21] ~ Guy Edan: Is it a new brand/account?
[18.04.25, 3:02:46] ~ Christopher Murphy: Yes, relatively new
[18.04.25, 3:05:13] ~ Mason Schulze: Are you using your own content or ripped content
[18.04.25, 3:11:20] ~ Guy Edan: When i launched my skincare brand a few months ago, i had $300-$500 CPMs for 2 months. Tried many things and nothing worked, eventually did a new ad account, new pixel, new FB page, new copy in the landing page to ensure everything is FB compliant, and after a few rounds of creative testings we found a winner that finally had a low CPM, and since that one, most ads after that had lower CPMs as well. We still are getting $60-$100 CPMs but we can work with that as opposed to $300-500 lol
[18.04.25, 3:11:59] ~ Guy Edan: Unfortunately can’t pin point exactly what fixed it but u can test those
[18.04.25, 3:17:35] ~ Christopher Murphy: Own content
[18.04.25, 3:17:48] ~ Christopher Murphy: Okay, thanks for the insight! Super frustrating aha
[18.04.25, 3:20:20] ~ Guy Edan: It really is but you’ll figure it out eventually 💪🏼
[18.04.25, 6:52:23] ~ Mo: guys do u know how get post IDs when running dynamic creative campaign/ads ?
[18.04.25, 7:09:49] ~ Michael: How did  u do the meta spy
[18.04.25, 7:11:49] Topi: insider
[18.04.25, 10:39:36] ~ Gord JB: Hi guys 
We’re trying to transfer design from figma into Shopify code for desktop & mobile. 
Dev is having trouble with the mobile side. 

Are there any new tools out there that copy the design into nice code well?
[18.04.25, 11:16:16] ~ Gord JB: How would you get shadow penalties? 

We experience higher cpms 
5 year old account 

But bought some followers on insta back in the beginning. Would that affect?
[18.04.25, 12:10:13] ~ Filippo: hey guys, Im creating a US PayPal, I dont live in the US and they ask for home address in United States, cant select country, any solution?
[18.04.25, 12:15:43] ~ Matt: You can buy reports to see if you do
[18.04.25, 12:15:51] ~ Matt: Could be fake followers
[18.04.25, 12:27:07] ~ Gord JB: Cheers!
[18.04.25, 12:27:25] ~ Gord JB: Where can I buy reports from?
[18.04.25, 12:30:23] ~ Matt: I’ll DM you
[18.04.25, 12:35:27] ~ Gord JB: Thanks
[18.04.25, 16:04:42] ~ Nico: report with insider cost aprox 250$ don't pay too high
[18.04.25, 16:05:06] ~ Nico: also Hiva score mostly impact ad approval, its the shadow penalties that needs to be checkd
[18.04.25, 16:27:42] ~ Gord JB: Thanks
What sort of ad penalties are common offences?
[18.04.25, 17:05:38] ~ Bazeed: for people using bestfulfil ad accounts here, is it normal to take 10+ hrs for them to topup wire transfers? (after its settled on your end) ‎<This message was edited>

[18.04.25, 19:00:30] ~ Caesar: hmm not really man, but on weeekends they can be slow sometimes, also they work on chinese timezone so keep that in mind
[18.04.25, 19:10:58] ~ Davide: hey guys, anyone knows a tool/software/extention that works very well to extract all the reviews from amazon and create an CSV or text file putting everything together?

[18.04.25, 19:14:29] ~ Davide: yeah downloaded it before and paid pro version. The thing is… it’s able just to download 100 reviews, not more. 
if there are 1000+ reviews on a product, I would like to have all of them
[18.04.25, 19:15:22] ~ Kyle Twohill: ahh I see
[18.04.25, 20:05:58] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Anyone here got an electronic product with an app? I have a brand that's looking to add a new electronic product and offer an app with it. We're looking for input related to customer service, etc. Is this going to be too burdensome? Are we going to get inundated with stupid customers who can't connect their product to the app or WiFi or other stupid crap like that?

Obviously, we're assuming it's a good product that will work. Unfortunately there are a lot of stupid consumers out there.

I appreciate any thoughts. Thanks y'all.

[19.04.25, 5:04:39] ~ Wouter: We’re going to target Europe but need to translate all content in the native languages. Anyone knows a good app that is accurate?
[19.04.25, 8:42:41] ~ Bazeed: having an app where they can control the device works good, most manufacturers dont have that option youll need to hire devs. can cost anywhere from 5-20k depending on the app
[19.04.25, 11:56:25] ~ Filippo: whos got Paypal USA as a non US resident?
[19.04.25, 12:45:45] ~ Vish: I have it
[19.04.25, 12:46:10] ~ Filippo: im trying to create an account but PP asks me for a home address and I can only provide a US address
[19.04.25, 12:46:29] ~ Vish: Yes provide business registration address
[19.04.25, 12:46:31] ~ Filippo: do u just provide the company’s address? technically the address should be eprsonal
[19.04.25, 12:46:32] ~ Filippo: ok
[19.04.25, 12:46:35] ~ Vish: They accept that
[19.04.25, 12:48:08] ~ Filippo: thank you
[19.04.25, 13:08:42] ~ Felix: This is just a smart way meta squeezes some money out of you
[19.04.25, 13:11:46] ~ Bazeed: does this make any difference in performance, never noticed it
[19.04.25, 13:26:58] ~ Felix: Not a big difference, but it depends on the creative output you have. If you have 1000 ads online, this can sum up to the monthly salary of a personal assistant

It's just an unecessary thing ‎<This message was edited>
[19.04.25, 13:28:54] ~ Fabian: I need agency for FB ad accounts asap. If you know any please dm me with recommendations.
[19.04.25, 13:30:22] ~ Mithiran: Hey guys does anyone here do product seeding? Do you give creators any sort of brief or get them to do whatever?
[19.04.25, 14:00:22] ~ Musawer: Hey guys, since we use Funnelish, when our customers purchase upsells, Facebook tracks it separately and that's why our CPA on Facebook appears lower than normal. 

We use cost cap in campaigns but we set the target CPA according to the real CPA and that's why Facebook Dont reduce spend on days when performance is bad. 

Now, if we lower the cost cap, will there be a problem because we will set a lower CPA target than our competitors and average market?
[19.04.25, 14:02:59] ~ Mithiran: Someone i know who used funnelish, found a way to not report upsell sales to facebook. Not sure how but maybe you can try?
[19.04.25, 14:03:24] ~ Filippo: i know people who dont report post purchase upsells back to FB
[19.04.25, 14:05:07] ~ Mithiran: Ive heard that reporting it can cause facebook to raise your cpa cause they know you're making more money? im not sure if its true or not
[19.04.25, 14:13:53] ~ Musawer: Yeah but it would decrease the ROAS at facebook if we not track the upsells revenue
[19.04.25, 14:27:24] Carlos Leeseman: There is a easy solution guys. Make sure you put time delay in the product automations in Funnelish, so Funnelish push it as 1 order to Shopify instead of multiple
[19.04.25, 14:39:28] ~ Filippo: Idk I scaled a product where each sale was like 2-3 conversions on fb
[19.04.25, 16:17:43] Carlos Leeseman: That’s why I’m not tracking upsell orders, because it’s raising CPA
[19.04.25, 18:29:08] ~ Filippo: I used a service on Fiverr, received it after 6 weeks ‎<This message was edited>

[20.04.25, 8:57:41] ~ Ben Mansour: Income tax depends on where you live and your country laws when you pay yourself
[20.04.25, 8:57:54] ~ Ben Mansour: Corporate tax is 0% if you set up in wyoming
[20.04.25, 8:58:17] ~ Ben Mansour: Sales tax yes, if you hit a certain threshold in every state
[20.04.25, 8:58:46] ~ Ben Mansour: But the threshold is big
[20.04.25, 9:12:27] ~ Michael: as far as i know, the income tax is based on the country of residence as long as you don't have clients in the USA. If you have US clients, I thought the income tax still applies, regardless of the country of residence?
[20.04.25, 10:56:42] ~ Bazeed: u dont have to pay personal income tax with us llc as long as you dont have physical presence there, like a physical warehouse office, can you still have a 3pl and pay no tax
[20.04.25, 10:57:04] ~ Bazeed: corporate tax is also 0% as long as the same applies, only sales tax like @⁨~Ben Mansour⁩  said
[20.04.25, 10:58:00] ~ Bazeed: however for us citizens this dosent work they have to pay income tax regardless
[20.04.25, 11:13:27] ~ Michael: Thanks guys! And how do u Deal with the Import tarrifs ? What needs to be taken into account?
[20.04.25, 11:15:05] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Deepl to start. Also ChatGPT
[20.04.25, 11:15:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Need to pay only sales tax
[20.04.25, 11:20:36] ~ Wouter: Yeah but no apps?

[20.04.25, 16:44:23] ~ tommy: how do you offer Klarna to US shoppers if my WooPayments account is based in europe?
i noticed that at checkout, if the shopper’s address is european, klarna is shown, otherwise is hidden
[20.04.25, 17:32:02] ~ Mithiran: what do you mean by what needs to be taken into account? in terms of taxes?
[20.04.25, 17:53:24] ~ Michael: In terms of the Import tarrifs? Do I need to increase the prices or what are you guys doing? I never sold to usa before and have no clue how the tarrifs will effect the business
[20.04.25, 17:54:26] ~ Michael: Or do u let the business run as usual?
[20.04.25, 17:54:39] ~ Michael: Like nothing happened
[20.04.25, 21:55:02] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: So if I am not from the US with a US LLC and working with a us based factory that is also the 3pl, I would still not be liable for income tax because it’s not my own warehouse?
[21.04.25, 0:07:03] ~ Brian: We use Langify to do translations.
[21.04.25, 2:32:12] ~ Wouter: Works well
[21.04.25, 4:22:14] ~ Mithiran: For us we just have to ship to USA by boat DDP. It hasn’t raised our costs at all but it’s a pain planning 90 days ahead
[21.04.25, 4:26:07] ~ Aaron Ware: Samezies
[21.04.25, 4:27:13] ~ Wouter: Why? It’s only a couple of $ that’s going to be added.
[21.04.25, 4:27:30] ~ Wouter: Price is changing today for my 3pl and it’s definitely managable
[21.04.25, 4:30:08] ~ Aaron Ware: Instead of going up couple bucks ours will go down couple bucks and be faster = no brainer
[21.04.25, 4:33:01] ~ Wouter: Perfect
[21.04.25, 4:33:06] ~ Wouter: But hard to plan for 90 days.
[21.04.25, 4:33:15] ~ Mithiran: Yep - just have to be really good at planning
[21.04.25, 4:33:40] ~ Mithiran: Are you talking about through air shipping like Yunexpress?
[21.04.25, 4:33:41] ~ Aaron Ware: Ours is closer to 60
[21.04.25, 5:14:14] ~ Michael: So I don't need to do any adjustments so far if I also want to sell to US market regarding the tarrifs ? Nothing has changed?
[21.04.25, 6:02:49] ~ Aaron Ware: Expect delays and prices to go up
[21.04.25, 6:03:17] ~ Bazeed: Factory not sure but 3pl yes, u can double check with a tax advisor.
[21.04.25, 7:48:04] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: Ok thank you
[21.04.25, 7:52:43] ~ Michael: Thanks!
[21.04.25, 10:46:27] ~ Riccardo Sonetti: Hey guys, my agent just told me that starting from the 24th, they won’t be able to ship to the US for a few days, until the tariff regulations are clarified.
Are you experiencing the same issue?
[21.04.25, 10:49:36] ~ Mithiran: Yep I think yunexpress is stopping that shipping line

"Most [audience] think [common belief], but [contrarian insight]. I discovered this after [specific experience/data point]."

‎[22.04.25, 3:54:29] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
[22.04.25, 3:56:21] ~ Caesar: so hard to say because all you show is metrics and without context they mean nothing

you can for example improve checkout cvr% by actually improving copy on the advertorial and sales page for example

you can also qualify better on advertorial, which would increase your checkout cvr% but not neccessarily keep the adv% the same either

[22.04.25, 21:56:07] ~ Davide: Do you guys have started to pay tariff or not right now?
[22.04.25, 21:58:42] ~ Jeb: I pay a 15% one
[22.04.25, 22:02:09] ~ Charles: They arent affective yet… Why do you already have to pay more?
[22.04.25, 22:02:32] ~ Jeb: I pay part of a china one from a supplier. I pay 15% they pay 29% ‎<This message was edited>
[22.04.25, 22:03:15] ~ Davide: Do you pay 15% from each order?
[22.04.25, 22:04:14] ~ Jeb: I make manufacture my own products in USA. Part of my ingredients come from china. And of those some are exempt and some I pay 15% and the supplier pays 29%
[22.04.25, 23:41:50] ~ Kyle Twohill: for anyone using checkout champ with a shopfiy PDP were you able to make it work with a slide out cart. I was told it has issues but need to make it work
[22.04.25, 23:55:24] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone know how to stop Facebook reporting upsells as purchases?
‎[23.04.25, 1:54:22] ~ Phil: ‎image omitted
[23.04.25, 1:55:05] ~ Phil: It’s pretty broad my question but if it helps I’m in the jewelry and clothing niche
[23.04.25, 2:02:57] ~ Harrison: Look’s like a lot of people are dropping off at your cart, maybe adding a free gift shown in your cart may help if you haven’t done so already
[23.04.25, 2:05:50] ~ Phil: Yeah my offer is but 2 get 1 free
[23.04.25, 2:06:36] ~ Phil: Cart I tried to optimize 2 days ago but I’m getting just under 50% going to checkout from cart so not sure if my checkout needs more optimising
[23.04.25, 2:13:28] ~ Harrison: I would say as checkout’s are tough to optimise further than the standard, maybe revise your offer as clearly people are getting second thoughts before pressing buy
[23.04.25, 2:15:24] ~ Phil: Yeah true
[23.04.25, 2:15:27] ~ Phil: Thanks for the tips
[23.04.25, 3:06:06] ~ Brett Fallarino: We had the same issue not too long ago. We changed the price and it fixed the issue. The old price wasn’t resonating with the customer
[23.04.25, 3:06:51] ~ Brett Fallarino: Or your ads suck haha
[23.04.25, 3:42:32] ~ Phil: Ads are getting really good metrics I think I may change the pricing think it’s throwing customers off
[23.04.25, 3:57:33] ~ Mo: just wondering u decreased the price ? by how much ?
[23.04.25, 3:59:19] ~ Brett Fallarino: We tested multiple price-points. Higher and lower. 

Ours is higher AOV $150+ so we’re testing in increments of $10 (e.g. $10 lower, $20 lower, $30 lower and vice-versa/(higher))
[23.04.25, 4:00:04] ~ Mo: got it bro, which ones worked out , higher or lower ?
[23.04.25, 4:00:32] ~ Brett Fallarino: Slightly lower unfortunately
[23.04.25, 4:01:17] ~ Brett Fallarino: We’re going to test extreme price-spikes when we build more momentum + build a better product. $50+ / $100+ and see take-rate / RPI
[23.04.25, 4:22:24] ~ Mo: yes makes sense bro !
[23.04.25, 7:16:31] ~ Henry: Hey guys, what’s a good open and click rate for campaign emails? Looking to assess my email marketing agency’s performance
[23.04.25, 7:18:38] ~ Mithiran: We just recently tested reducing our product price by 2 dollars and adding in $4.95 shipping. So overall the order value is still higher. add to cart rate increased and checkout barely dropped. So far so good.
[23.04.25, 7:26:50] ~ Brett Fallarino: Also add Shipping Protection toggle-on
[23.04.25, 7:27:25] ~ Phil: Okay thanks for that
[23.04.25, 12:17:44] ~ Deividas Tokaris: Hey, does anyone need some extra creative output?

I've got some extra capacity from my creative team and would like to test some batches for different ecomms.

I can do a batch for free, if interested feel free to DM.
[23.04.25, 12:18:21] ~ Phil: DM^^
[23.04.25, 12:28:48] ~ Deividas Tokaris: It seems a lot of people are interested in creatives.

If that's the case, then catch this 😂

[23.04.25, 12:40:37] ~ Jonny: hi guys, can anyone recommend a solid media buyer. Our current one is just massively under performing. Ideally looking for a freelancer with proven track record of scaling, will consider an agency but have used a few in the past and they were all average
[23.04.25, 13:05:08] ~ Omar Tayara: Hey guys i built a new landing page but the problem is it’s wayyy too slow. 33 overall score on pagespeed insights. What do you guys suggest i do? Tried to hire someone from speed optimisation but they didnt change shit
[23.04.25, 14:50:49] Alex  Fedotoff: legends! i’ve replaced quite a few people with AI and just made a video on top 5 hires that would be worth replacing

[23.04.25, 16:09:46] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I'm using https://apps.shopify.com/elevate-ab-testing
[23.04.25, 16:09:48] ~ Alvaro De Prada: is pretty nice
[23.04.25, 16:10:22] ~ Rick: better than intelligems?
[23.04.25, 16:11:48] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Depends on what you define by better
[23.04.25, 16:11:57] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I was paying 1.7k for intelligems
[23.04.25, 16:12:01] ~ Alvaro De Prada: now 299
[23.04.25, 16:12:06] ~ Alvaro De Prada: for basically the same types of test
[23.04.25, 16:12:20] ~ Rick: price and speed
[23.04.25, 16:12:57] ~ Rick: i know that the snippet of intelligems slows down the site

[23.04.25, 18:13:24] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I got this this morningh:

Latest News From couriers
1. 4px will pre-collect taxes and fees based on 160% of the declared value, and shipping costs will see a slight increase.

2. Yanwen charges 23.5/kg + 2.8 per parcel based on weight, with no additional taxes or fees.

3. YunExpress has not yet announced a detailed plan.

All these policies apply only to ordinary products. Additionally, all logistics companies recommend that sellers stop shipping orders to the U.S. by the 25th.
[23.04.25, 18:15:35] ~ Timur: Yeah, same
[23.04.25, 18:16:42] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Is going to be a wild ride for a bit until Trump brings them down to 10% 🙏🏻
[23.04.25, 18:18:15] ~ Timur: Is there anyone planning to stop selling to the US? Increasing prices is the best option for now, but it's still a big mess
[23.04.25, 18:24:52] ~ Mithiran: Ship by boat to USA and get a 3pl there
[23.04.25, 18:27:58] ~ Brett Fallarino: Bulk-order Sea Freight to 3PL. I recommend Amazon AWD / MCF. It’s been great for us

YunExpress's US tariff solution online interaction 🫡 ‎<This message was edited>
[24.04.25, 3:57:26] ~ Fabian: 2 years ago i had an app on shopify that allow the customer to chose one type of shoes, one type of pants etc in a bundle. someone know the name of an app like this?
[24.04.25, 3:58:44] ~ Fabian: most mix and match apps just allow you to chose 1 type of pants, instead of chosing beetwen 5 diffrent pants. 

so i need a bundle app that allow you to chose product 1, product 2, product 3. but 1,2,3 is each diffrent type of products
[24.04.25, 4:05:56] ~ Joshua: Are you not just paying the same tariffs?
[24.04.25, 5:03:37] ~ Mithiran: Does anyone know what they said? I didn't get a chance to join
[24.04.25, 5:06:04] ~ Mithiran: DDP price for boat only increased by $1 per kg for us and either ways its a lot cheaper to ship by boat to usa compared to straight from china, so it kinda evens out including the tariffs. But im not 100% sure if these ddp prices will stay constant
[24.04.25, 5:08:09] ~ Joshua: Guessing your product is relatively light?
[24.04.25, 5:09:42] ~ Mithiran: No its like 1kg
[24.04.25, 6:18:51] ~ Austin: How do you guys create custom GPT’s I hear all kinds of talk but no implementation. If you could DM and share that’d be awesome.
[24.04.25, 12:55:45] ~ Mikael: Hey. I have a BM on FB with old company info. Is it okey to just run ads on this with another company card paying? Or is it also okey to switch company info to a HK company with nominee? Would it be any issues?
[24.04.25, 13:13:37] ~ Phil: I honestly don’t think it matters
[24.04.25, 13:14:01] ~ Phil: Most BMS have many ad accounts that link to different stores and company’s
[24.04.25, 13:14:08] ~ Phil: With different payments. Shouldn’t matter
[24.04.25, 13:19:51] ~ Brett Fallarino: Around 25 days for us
[24.04.25, 13:21:42] ~ Brett Fallarino: Swapd.co
[24.04.25, 13:24:02] ~ Brett Fallarino: Our landed costs are much cheaper for now. Good question, we’ll look deeper into it in the coming days
[24.04.25, 13:32:00] ~ Ben Mansour: Guys who are shipping from china to usa currently
[24.04.25, 13:32:06] ~ Ben Mansour: What are you going to do?
[24.04.25, 13:32:38] ~ Phil: For US tariff, we got a tariff-free shipping line but it is currently only for clothing products, the price is similar as now, the new shipping line will be opened on April 28, so we will suspend shipments from April 25 to April 27
The tariff-free scheme for other products is expected to be released in the next few days. I will notify you immediately if there is any update.
[24.04.25, 13:32:42] ~ Phil: My supplier sent me this^^
[24.04.25, 13:36:02] ~ Ben Mansour: Nice!
[24.04.25, 13:36:20] ~ Ben Mansour: So better to wait a bit now
[24.04.25, 13:36:28] ~ Ben Mansour: Before making any decisions
[24.04.25, 13:36:31] ~ Phil: Seems like it yeah bro
[24.04.25, 13:36:55] ~ Phil: DM me in the next week and I’ll get the updates for you
[24.04.25, 13:38:24] ~ bowen: Our company already has multiple logistics solutions for the United States, and we will continue to Available.
For clothing is always available.
[24.04.25, 13:39:14] ~ Phil: There will always be ways around things. The Chinese are very smart people ahaha
[24.04.25, 13:43:39] ~ Wouter: I’ve got 2 3pl’s in china and all recommended to pause usa from today till the 5th may
[24.04.25, 13:43:41] ~ Wouter: At least stop ads
[24.04.25, 13:46:42] ~ Kimmo: We'll keep shipping using a cheap carrier from China and hope for the best. We also have stock on a boat to US so we can keep shipping and see what happens
[24.04.25, 13:52:41] ~ Wouter: Be careful with that ‎<This message was edited>
[24.04.25, 13:53:04] ~ Kimmo: Yep - gotta monitor closely
[24.04.25, 14:08:07] ~ Ben Mansour: Does anyone have good examples of pre order banners
[24.04.25, 14:11:10] ~ Phil: I wouldn’t bro. I heard they are going to stop orders from China for now once they hit US
[24.04.25, 14:11:17] ~ Phil: Not worth the risks and chargebacks honestly
[24.04.25, 14:11:56] ~ Phil: We can still continue to ship, but if the package arrives in the United States after May 2, there may be customs clearance issues and the package will be returned. But if the package arrives in the United States before then, there will be no problem.

This is also from my supplier^^
[24.04.25, 14:13:19] ~ Ben Mansour: I want to know
[24.04.25, 14:13:26] ~ Ben Mansour: What are the exact current tax rate?
[24.04.25, 14:13:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Is it 145%
[24.04.25, 14:13:35] ~ Kimmo: Yeah I'm talking to a couple different people and it seems like no-one in China knows what'll happen. But yeah we'll definitely keep our hand on the pulse - I just rather take on a bit of risk than lose momentum on ads
[24.04.25, 14:13:44] ~ Ben Mansour: Or 25$ or what exactly
[24.04.25, 14:20:02] ~ K: So just every package that’s from china is gonna send back?
[24.04.25, 14:20:11] ~ K: Automatically?
[24.04.25, 14:43:31] ~ Zsombor: Do you know any info about a possible solution for sunglasses?
[24.04.25, 14:44:04] ~ Phil: Unfortunately not brother sorry. Best ask your supplier im sure they have something ready or in place already for it all
[24.04.25, 15:19:19] ~ tommy: clear the cache

[25.04.25, 15:01:53] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yep
[25.04.25, 15:08:55] ~ Jonny: Did it impact CVR when you started collecting?
[25.04.25, 15:09:34] ~ Alvaro De Prada: A bit but nothing too concerning. US is used to it
[25.04.25, 15:16:58] ~ tommy: you mean that you add sales tax on top of the displayed price when shoppers add their address at checkout?

[25.04.25, 16:46:57] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Might be a bit of a broad question but how do you prioritize iterating on a winning ad VS working on new creatives? Would you focus on iterations until they stop working?
[25.04.25, 16:51:58] ~ Matt: We had this for £10k on cost caps and they still haven’t paid us
[25.04.25, 16:54:19] ~ Gustavo Drumm: Did they said they would pay?
[25.04.25, 16:54:44] ~ Gustavo Drumm: Here they outright refused to acknowledge the situation

[26.04.25, 20:00:45] Alex  Fedotoff: I broke down our OTO1 vsl structure on twitter that’s doing pretty well for us. Check out here: https://x.com/FedotOff90/status/1915482158426214796
[26.04.25, 21:17:58] ~ Kyle Twohill: Question for people using checkout checkout champ linked to shopify. On my checkout page I have shop pay/apple pay activated in addition to the standard credit card entry. I noticed customers who use payment options besides just credit card entry cant buy post purchase upsells. Is it worth it to deactivate shop pay/apple pay as the aov is significantly higher when they can take the upsells. or is there some sort of workaround
[26.04.25, 21:25:19] ~ Ben Mansour: I have 2 manus invitation codes
[26.04.25, 21:25:21] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone wants?
[26.04.25, 21:47:03] ~ tommy: what’s the % of shop pay orders?
i moved from shopify to woocommerce and I know that my Apple pay % is ~12%
i didn’t notice any CR decrease without shop pay, on the contrary I think that the WooCommerce checkout actually converts better
[26.04.25, 21:50:22] ~ Kyle Twohill: around 55% use either shop pay google pay apple pay etc. and interesting
[26.04.25, 22:31:24] ~ Matt: For people testing LPs does a redirect test affect meta results at all?
[26.04.25, 22:31:48] ~ Matt: I have a winning LP and want to redirect old ads that went to the old LP to the new one
[26.04.25, 22:44:12] ~ Felix: Can't you redirect on the backend to the new LP if someone gets on the old LP?
[26.04.25, 22:56:14] ~ Matt: Yh that’s what I’m doing
[26.04.25, 22:56:26] ~ Matt: But this can signal to meta cloaking some people say so CPMs go up
[26.04.25, 22:56:37] ~ Matt: But I wanted to see if anyone’s actually seen that themselves
[27.04.25, 0:27:06] ~ Alexander Sundström: anybody here sees high cpm, cpc for delivery on ads to instagram? our cpc on good ads has gone from 0.80 usd to 20 usd. we have never seen anything like it
[27.04.25, 0:28:49] ~ Alexander Sundström: and meta is spending 90% on instagram, cpm and cpc are good for facebook
[27.04.25, 0:34:16] ~ Matt: Have you changed anything on the website? Copy perhaps
[27.04.25, 0:34:50] ~ Alexander Sundström: nothing
[27.04.25, 0:36:37] ~ Alexander Sundström: website is fine, atc, ic, cvr is the same. the traffic from instagram is just really expensive.
[27.04.25, 0:37:25] ~ Alexander Sundström: did meta do a big change a few days ago? i heard something about adding threads to placements
[27.04.25, 4:01:48] ~ Mo: how do u know which platform a funnel is built in ?
[27.04.25, 4:01:54] ~ Mo: is there a tool
[27.04.25, 4:26:40] ~ Mo: i want to have an advertorial with a video only ( video about 3min) , they watch the video then straight to rest of the funnel ( sale page, checkout..), any idea where its best to have sth like this, funnelish, checkout champ, others….  ( terms of page speed… ) thanks !
[27.04.25, 6:29:36] ~ Austin: I hear most guys going with funnelish
[27.04.25, 6:33:46] ~ Mo: it doesnt slow down the page when u host a 3-4min VSL ?
[27.04.25, 6:36:49] ~ Austin: I’ve heard funnelish is great on page speed
[27.04.25, 6:37:31] ~ Mo: awsome thanks for the feedback man

[28.04.25, 14:33:24] Topi: trademark your stuff and take them down, not a big deal, only trademark application can be enough

[29.04.25, 1:53:19] ~ Guy Edan: A bit of a newbie question perhaps but do u guys test background music when launching new VSL? To some degree I think music and effects can set the tone for a vid, but on the other hand, not sure if it’s worth focusing on too much. What are your thoughts? ‎<This message was edited>
[29.04.25, 7:17:31] ~ Bazeed: ofc music plays a big role, u can send your vsl script to gpt and ask it to provide timeframe for each section and what kind of music to add.

storyblocks has amazijg music for vsls
[29.04.25, 7:18:48] ~ Bazeed: but also keep it very sutble and low volume, it should should be an addition to your whole story and getting audience to flow with the vid
[29.04.25, 7:22:01] ~ Bazeed: https://youtu.be/ewH5uZVjaAY?si=1PixDuf12DktXmH8

great example of a proper story flow

[29.04.25, 17:41:09] ~ Bryan T: For anyone selling to the US, has anyone experimented with seperating the product price and the tariff price? Amazon is now adding that so it seems like a no brainer to follow.

[29.04.25, 17:44:28] ~ Bryan T: They just announced it, they’re going to list the cost of tariffs on every product

[29.04.25, 19:54:20] ~ Fabian: Anyone have good contact for DMCA takedowns? Competitor is stealing all our content
[29.04.25, 20:51:07] ~ Brian: Just do this: https://x.com/stefangeorgi/status/1915394266425143409?s=46. It's what we do as well instead of just swipe files. Just remember to use a US VPN when visiting the editoral sites.

[30.04.25, 2:57:28] ~ Brett Fallarino: It’ll fix itself in a few days if not tmmo. These things happen all the time when Meta rolls out updates. Focus on more important things in the meantime
[30.04.25, 3:07:32] Amit Wadhawan: Thanks for the input guys! Found another way to turn off the ad sets. For anyone else interested, 
- Select the ad
- ⁠click the dropdown next to the “Edit” button and then you can choose to turn in on/off

[30.04.25, 11:30:06] ~ Brice: I've seen some of the big SEO platforms like SEMrush are starting to roll out tools for AI search rankings
[30.04.25, 11:33:03] ~ UHO: Agreed. If you’re a Google consultant, it’s time to pivot, clients will soon ask for visibility within AI ecosystems, not just search engines. Think beyond ranking on Google…start thinking about how your content shows up in ChatGPT or Claude’s responses.

[30.04.25, 12:32:17] ~ ECOM BULLS: also should we lower the price of upsell compared to main product ?
[30.04.25, 12:32:33] ~ ECOM BULLS: upselling same product didn't work for me
[30.04.25, 12:32:47] ~ Rick: same for me
[30.04.25, 12:33:07] ~ ECOM BULLS: so what offer are you running for upsell and is it lower price than main product ?
[30.04.25, 12:33:34] ~ Rick: it's a complementar product, have a lower price that the main one
[30.04.25, 12:33:40] ~ Rick: so have less friction
[30.04.25, 12:33:46] ~ ECOM BULLS: yeah same for me
[30.04.25, 12:33:49] ~ Rick: but is very high complementar
[30.04.25, 12:34:30] ~ ECOM BULLS: okay so you probably tested the upsell product too
[30.04.25, 12:34:58] ~ ECOM BULLS: with other product or directly chose it cuz it was the best complementar ?
[30.04.25, 12:35:29] ~ Rick: yes the first upsell test is always quantity of the main ‎<This message was edited>
[30.04.25, 12:35:32] ~ Steve: Headline, top image, lead drive most of the results
[30.04.25, 12:35:52] ~ Steve: if youve not written winning advertorials before i high recommend you swipe ones you know converted well and work within that framework for yours
[30.04.25, 12:36:12] ~ ECOM BULLS: got it
[30.04.25, 12:36:27] ~ Steve: advertorials are hard, most people screw them up just guessing how they should come together. Follow proven structure then iterate leads and test leads against each other
[30.04.25, 12:36:44] ~ Steve: mostly the copy/messaging matters way more than design at first, so don’t sweat design too much until later
[30.04.25, 12:37:12] ~ ECOM BULLS: choosing the angle to approach is confusing tbh
[30.04.25, 12:37:33] ~ Steve: pull from your ads and other data points
[30.04.25, 12:37:36] ~ ECOM BULLS: like should i base it off of fear angle, money saving or story based
[30.04.25, 12:37:58] ~ Steve: if you have stuff in ads that is working or things you see over and over again from customers or comments, those are good places to start for advertorial angles
[30.04.25, 12:38:48] ~ ECOM BULLS: okay got it
[30.04.25, 12:39:16] ~ ECOM BULLS: maybe i should run quiz to find what people are lean towards and then create funnel based off it, do you suggest ?
[30.04.25, 12:39:31] ~ Steve: you can do post purchase surveys too, those help
[30.04.25, 12:40:16] ~ ECOM BULLS: surely will try it
[30.04.25, 12:40:16] ~ Steve: for me, i’ve written so many hundreds of advertorials I just start a new product with an advertorial or two right away. I will do my research and go with the best angles I think are gonna work. Maybe test a long form ADV vs a listcle to start, have done that before
[30.04.25, 12:40:26] ~ Steve: then just watch the clarity data
[30.04.25, 12:40:49] ~ Steve: see if its a winner or loser or what’s resonating, also just run tons of ads and get data there too, the update the advertorial accordingly
[30.04.25, 12:41:08] ~ ECOM BULLS: what do you look for in clarity like the most clicked area, scroll depth any more pointers ?
[30.04.25, 12:41:15] ~ Steve: basically just never stop testing the advertorial level because once you crack the advertorial it changes everythng. Better customer, better AOV, lower refunds, etc etc
[30.04.25, 12:41:37] ~ Steve: I watch scroll depth. like someone said about 30/40% CTR is good baseline, above that is very solid.
[30.04.25, 12:41:48] ~ Steve: I want to get 50% of people making it to the first major CTA
[30.04.25, 12:42:07] ~ ECOM BULLS: so you place your first cta at 50% ?
[30.04.25, 12:42:07] ~ Steve: if I have below that then I know I have work to do, or if a huge amount drop off after the first image and headline, then I know my lead sucks
[30.04.25, 12:42:09] ~ ECOM BULLS: not at the end ?
[30.04.25, 12:42:17] ~ Steve: not always
[30.04.25, 12:42:26] ~ ECOM BULLS: okay understood
[30.04.25, 12:42:28] ~ Steve: Usually my long form ones have 3 CTA
[30.04.25, 12:42:43] ~ Rick: sticky as well?
[30.04.25, 12:43:02] ~ Steve: one at the very top right (which is a low quality CTA but handles people just ready to move on), then I have one shortly after the product introduction, like maybe around the first testimonials area, and then one at the end
[30.04.25, 12:43:10] ~ Steve: Have seen ones with the sticky do well as well
[30.04.25, 12:43:40] ~ Rick: i do that apper sticky after like 30/40% of scroll
[30.04.25, 12:43:50] ~ Steve: thats a good idea
[30.04.25, 12:44:50] ~ ECOM BULLS: do you see similar ctr in performing advertorial in most cases ?
[30.04.25, 12:45:17] ~ ECOM BULLS: do you write short pdd after long advertorial ? ‎<This message was edited>
[30.04.25, 12:45:32] ~ Steve: no, i dont use short pdf
[30.04.25, 12:45:37] ~ Steve: i just drop them on the PDP
[30.04.25, 12:45:43] ~ ECOM BULLS: i mean pdp
[30.04.25, 12:45:45] ~ ECOM BULLS: my bad
[30.04.25, 12:45:48] ~ Steve: ad > ADV > PDP
[30.04.25, 12:46:01] ~ ECOM BULLS: do you keep the pdp short or long ?
[30.04.25, 12:46:18] ~ ECOM BULLS: at the start do you reveal price at pdp ?
[30.04.25, 12:46:21] ~ Steve: pretty standard length, similar approach to most
[30.04.25, 12:46:24] ~ Rick: how many post P do you have?
[30.04.25, 12:46:41] ~ Steve: checkout Nooro’s funnels they’ve obviously tested the crap out of theirs, thats a pretty proven format
[30.04.25, 12:46:58] ~ Steve: i like to go with proven formats, especially for new product or if I were new to advertorials and PDP pages
[30.04.25, 12:47:16] ~ Steve: just so you can get something up and get data back and be confident your structure doesn’t suck or isnt tripping you up
[30.04.25, 12:47:28] ~ Steve: then just pay attention to data and make iterations quickly based on what youre seeing
[30.04.25, 12:47:37] ~ Steve: copying others only gets you so far, but its good way to go 0-1
[30.04.25, 12:48:01] ~ Steve: depends on product, as many as 4 sometimes as many as 1, me personally i take a much different approach to upsells than most
[30.04.25, 12:48:12] ~ Steve: i dont even worry about upsells on a new offer until the new offer is working
[30.04.25, 12:48:35] ~ Steve: whats the point? The only thing that matters is making the offer work, everything else is a distraction to that, if you cant make the main offer work than you upsells don’t matter
[30.04.25, 12:48:50] ~ Steve: just crack the offer, then add upsells, that’s aways been my approach, even on 40 minute VSL funnels
[30.04.25, 12:49:30] ~ ECOM BULLS: lastly do you run any pre purchase upsell like order bump or cart slide ?
[30.04.25, 12:49:45] ~ ECOM BULLS: so just straight clean funnel and only upsell after the purchase ?
[30.04.25, 12:50:02] ~ Steve: otherwise you end up in a mess - you’re testing ads, you’re split testing advertorials, testing your PDP and then working on upsells all at the same time. Unless you’re super experienced that’s just a lot of variables at once
[30.04.25, 12:50:29] ~ ECOM BULLS: right
[30.04.25, 12:50:37] ~ Steve: Again, depends on the offer I am running. Usually yeah like to add some sort of order bump or cross sell product on the checkout, but that all comes after i know the offer is gonna work
[30.04.25, 12:50:54] ~ ECOM BULLS: okay
[30.04.25, 12:52:07] ~ ECOM BULLS: thanks guys
[30.04.25, 12:58:25] ~ Matt: How do you approach the images? Do you make them look kinda low budget as I’ve seen a fair few advertorials with kinda crappy looking images
[30.04.25, 12:59:06] ~ Rick: depends on product, for me half img and half video works good
[30.04.25, 12:59:23] ~ Rick: or ai image with the pain point very visible
[30.04.25, 13:01:04] ~ Matt: Supps where it might not be visible in a clear before/after image/video
[30.04.25, 13:02:15] ~ Rick: like this https://get.trybello.com/cc-trybello-hair-helper-spray-adv-a10
[30.04.25, 13:02:30] ~ Steve: yeah, just like….more real, authentic looking does well - but also like on native images, weird works great
[30.04.25, 13:03:07] ~ Steve: https://mynuora.com/pages/gummies-listicle-for-vaginosis
[30.04.25, 13:03:19] ~ Steve: here’s one I’ve seen recently that I saved that i like
[30.04.25, 13:04:17] ~ Steve: it’s a “listicle” but it takes a proven listicle approach that doesn’t feel like a listicle out of the gate. It has a long form adv style headline, strong subhead, weird almost gross image, then a strong little lead that mentions the product and the USP

You don’t have to mention the product upfront always. You can keep them “blind” and sometimes this works better, good to test blind sometimes
[30.04.25, 13:04:47] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: this is very good
[30.04.25, 13:04:48] ~ Steve: but then it goes into the full 7 reasons why of a listicle, have seen this method work well for beauty too. Brunches and Crunches one crushed for a long time with that style
[30.04.25, 13:05:21] ~ Steve: Standard and proven format, works - even in beauty
[30.04.25, 13:06:03] ~ Steve: they also don’t have to be “ugly”, though “ugly” style pages do work very well esp if you’re selling to boomers
[30.04.25, 13:06:25] ~ Steve: if you’re selling to younger audiences, I’ve seen more branded ones do well too - Javy Coffee, Shine Armor etc are good examples
[30.04.25, 13:07:47] ~ Matt: Oh Yh I’ve seen this 👌
[30.04.25, 13:08:27] ~ Matt: Yh im selling to 55+ women
[30.04.25, 13:09:37] ~ Matt: And (I know this is case dependant) but have you seen any difference between founder style, voice of customer and an authority written advertorial?
[30.04.25, 13:09:51] ~ Matt: If we are selling supps for cats
[30.04.25, 13:09:58] ~ Matt: 50+ women mostly
[30.04.25, 13:10:02] ~ Steve: all those styles work, founder stuff doing very well right now especially at the ad level
[30.04.25, 13:10:20] ~ Steve: Cat vomit? Do this every day
[30.04.25, 13:10:25] ~ Steve: i get this email like 3 times a week lol
[30.04.25, 13:10:40] ~ Matt: Cheers I think I’ll start with that then (founder style)
[30.04.25, 13:10:42] ~ Steve: long form VSLs for pet have all pivoted to cat or dog teeth stuff
[30.04.25, 13:10:53] ~ Matt: People don’t trust vets as much anymore either
[30.04.25, 13:11:02] ~ Matt: Yh I’ve noticed that
[30.04.25, 13:11:10] ~ Steve: emotional “my pet almost died and we saved her” or “my pet died too soon i wish i knew this sooner” are proven pet angles over and over
[30.04.25, 13:11:18] ~ Matt: Easier to sell for sure as before and after images can be made via statics
[30.04.25, 13:12:16] ~ Steve: cat is just a way smaller market than dog when you compare, but i have found that cat owners are more likely to be multiple cat owners
[30.04.25, 13:12:26] ~ Steve: like a lot of people might have 1 dog, but tons of people have 2+ cats
[30.04.25, 13:12:52] ~ Steve: just something I’ve noticed, haven’t run a lot of cat stuff, but done plenty of pet stuff in general
[30.04.25, 13:23:19] ~ Matt: Yh I do dog stuff too, mostly joints but audience is super sceptical which is probs why major brands aren’t running it as their cold traffic hero product
[30.04.25, 15:19:07] ~ Rick: anyone have a good ref, where to buy trustpilot reviews?

[30.04.25, 17:39:23] ~ Brett Fallarino: How are you measuring KPI’s (CTR, CVR, etc.) from Advert > PDP? We are using GemPages for Advert
[30.04.25, 17:39:43] ~ Rick: heatmaps
[30.04.25, 17:39:52] ~ Rick: go on fb group
[30.04.25, 17:42:11] ~ Brett Fallarino: Thanks G
[30.04.25, 18:04:34] ~ Steve: Gem pages is great, just spoke at their ecomm event in vietnam, cool team and they are building out all sorts of new AI tracking tools and stuff
[30.04.25, 18:04:48] ~ Steve: I also use Replo, not as robust in the tracking but allows split tests and you can find super cheap devs for that everywhere
[30.04.25, 18:05:45] ~ Brett Fallarino: Congrats that’s sick
[30.04.25, 18:06:15] ~ Brett Fallarino: Any idea when they will roll-out their AI tracking?
[30.04.25, 18:07:00] ~ Steve: i think its coming, the founder told me they are rolling out upsells too
[30.04.25, 18:07:17] ~ Steve: they want people to be able to do advertorials, pdp pages and upsells all inside the same place and track them
[30.04.25, 18:09:13] ~ Brett Fallarino: It would be very convenient. I like they’re headed in this direction

[1.05.25, 4:54:35] ~ Adonis A: Thanks bro
[1.05.25, 9:40:28] ~ Anatoly: Thought I’d drop an update in case someone finds it useful:

1. Thanks to everyone who DMd me personally with some help or advise, you guys are legends.
2. ⁠I found out the breach happened through GoLogin proxy browser. Apparently their insider has been selling clients cookie data, making the access to profiles and ad accounts possible without passwords or 2FA. If you are using it, then stop and switch to something else immediately. After switching, change all your passwords and 2FA. Do not change it before you are on the new browser. Also see recent TP reviews backing this up. I am now back to using Incogniton, as many recommended.
3. ⁠Despite trying to find Meta insiders or some sketchy options to get my account and money back, I got help from the least expected place and this is - Meta standard support. Not sure if they upped their game or I just was lucky, but after reporting the incident, they even called me to discuss it on the phone. As a result, I have got a full refund, outstanding debt written off and my account is back and running. 

The moral of the story, do not disregard Meta support. Although they are shit most of the time, you might just get lucky every now and then.
[1.05.25, 15:05:01] ~ Bazeed: Has anyone had incredibly high decline rates from Stripe? Almost  50% payments are being declined from the “stripe radar”
[1.05.25, 16:18:49] ~ Al: Congrats man this is a highly unlikely happy ending in these situations
[1.05.25, 16:20:00] ~ Al: One thing I've started doing as well to stay safer is manually have to login every time I go into FB, and log out after. I sleep better lol
[1.05.25, 16:20:49] ~ Anatoly: Yes, thank you, I am well aware, which is why I wanted to encourage everyone to at least try this route, as initially it was not even on my list of options.
[1.05.25, 16:21:12] ~ Anatoly: I might start the same, makes perfect sense
[1.05.25, 18:18:03] ~ Matt: Anyone know a software or template I can use for meta style comment reviews? Something like this

"We’ve delayed the payout of one or more of your charges due to a risk of a fraudulent dispute."

Its happened to like half of my transactions

[2.05.25, 21:11:58] ~ Michael: Hey guys does the time zone in the ads manager  matter? For example run ads in US with German ad account and German time zone

[2.05.25, 23:24:50] ~ Brandon: Hey guys, quick question—what package tracking software do you use?

I heard some platforms keep the status as ‘Order Processing’ until the package reaches the local country. (So customer doesn’t see that the origin is china)

Is that true?
[3.05.25, 2:00:38] ~ Phil: Not too much but then again it would be spending in times you don’t want it to spend because it will go off germanys time. I recommend making a native ad account in the same time zone as your store

They seem solid. Most TT shop guys I've spoken to are super casual and like "yeah man, let's blow up TikTok, woo hoo!" Emplicit was very thoughtful, strategic, and had both numbers and experience that gave me a lot of confidence that they know what they're doing.
[6.05.25, 21:48:34] ~ Steve: Yeah that’s been my experience with TT guys as well lol “but like bro we’re crushing everyone wants to work with us right now so lemme know asap if we can onboard you” - its same every time lol

Thanks in advance ‎<This message was edited>
[7.05.25, 17:51:03] ~ Rick: anyone have like a sheet where to track all the CRO test and data?
[7.05.25, 19:42:17] ~ Cocow😈: What metrics of hook and hold rate ? you hold rate is it based on impressions or 3s video view ? 

Maybe analyse the drop off rate 25%->50%>75%>100% and check if you can do it better where the problem is. 

Maybe the hook and lead are great but rest of VSL is not related to these 15 first seconds. Make sure you have good close and CTA as well.

Finally, you can have good metrics, but just bad big idea so then people are not interested anymore maybe
[7.05.25, 19:47:11] ~ Bilal: Hey guys, anybody running issues with stripe in the EU market all of my transactions are getting blocked. Is there any workaround for it?

The hook and hold rate are based on 3 seconds video plays. Is that correct?
[7.05.25, 20:54:19] ~ Bilal: Thanks!!
[7.05.25, 21:12:09] ~ Cocow😈: Hold rate can be thruplay/impressions or thruplay/3 sec video plays. So if you benchmark, you really need to take the right one hahha

Thanks 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>
[8.05.25, 14:37:33] ~ Simeon Petrov: Collect only emails for prospects with 1 offer (10% OFF). Then have the Phone number collection on a different pop-up that is showed only in front of existing email subscribers with a better offer (15% OFF). This was you also facilitate repeat purchases via your phone number collection pop-up.
[8.05.25, 14:38:21] ~ Jonny: we offer 15% off for sms or email, our back end email numbers are very solid around 40%. working on improving margins so considering dropping opt in to 10%
[8.05.25, 14:39:01] ~ Simeon Petrov: Depends on your margins. Typically 5-10% for email and then 15% OFF for phone number collection where your phone number collection is on a different pop-up as I mentioned in the message above.
[8.05.25, 14:40:02] ~ Simeon Petrov: Trying to collect email and sms on same pop-up with 1 offer really decreases opt-in rates, subscription to conversion rates and causes friction. Even if you had the ability to offer people to skip the sms step if they didn't want to give their phone number, you'd still see lower opt-in rates in total.

[9.05.25, 1:13:49] ~ Jeb: Shipping question: 

What do you guys pay for shipping blended on average per order. So between your overnights, 2 day, and ground all blended. What is your average shipping cost per order
[9.05.25, 2:18:34] ~ Aaron Ware: Depends on weight
[9.05.25, 2:20:55] ~ Jeb: @⁨~Aaron Ware⁩ ahh ok, if anyone has like a blended average I’d be interested.

85% of my total order volume is fed ex 2 day. Flat rate anywhere in the USA, and I’m trying to decide if it’s worth the slight added expense of paying on average $9.62 blended to keep the brand strong.

It’s nice because they give all boxes, tape and shipping labels free. 

But I’m trying to decide if I should do more ground shipping ‎<This message was edited>

[9.05.25, 22:56:27] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Hey all, we're having issues with Meta lately. We have all kinds of different campaigns set up with multiple daily budgets, CCs, BCs, etc., and it's just not spending. Super frustrating - we've gone from ~$5k+/day spend down to $1k-$2k/day, not on purpose but because Meta won't spend our money. Has anyone else seen this? Any idea what's going on?
[9.05.25, 23:01:20] ~ Yuanda: are most of your campaign cost controlled ? 

If spend drop means the demand is lower and the cost controls are kicking in
[9.05.25, 23:01:36] ~ Nikola Petkov: I think that when you run CCs/BCs the campaigns won't spend budget if they're not gonna be able deliver results in the goal you've set. What I do when that happens is I raise with $1 the CC, usually that gives it more room to spend. Although lately since the last couple of meta updates we experience the same issue.
[10.05.25, 0:03:15] ~ Mike Kasdorf: I have CCs with multiple adsets inside. Each adset is a different $ level, and they go up pretty high. I've had other scaling campaigns at the same CC levels and have gotten good spend.

I also have bidcap campaigns with levels above the CC campaigns. Those aren't spending anything. It's ridiculous.
[10.05.25, 0:06:20] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Happens all the time, that's the advantage of cost caps, they spend when they're sure they can acquire a customer within our given CC. You'll have to raise the bid a little or just let it sit for a while
[10.05.25, 0:17:52] ~ Matt: Have you tried new creative styles VSLs, statics etc ? We have cost caps and nothing was working for months until we started running VSLs which tripled spend within a week
[10.05.25, 1:39:06] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Our ads are a mix of statics and videos. Video ads vary from 15 - 60 seconds. VSLs don't work for this particular product.
[10.05.25, 1:40:12] ~ Mike Kasdorf: I'm gonna raise the bidcap campaign for the weekend to see if we can get some action. Our testing campaigns are doing fantastic, so I know the ads aren't the problem.
[10.05.25, 2:59:26] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Duplicate them and raise it in that campaign, leave this on for now at current bid cap
[10.05.25, 2:59:50] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Make sure you're using post IDs so likes and comments are shared
[10.05.25, 3:37:35] ~ Mo: how many creatives ( approximately) a full time video editor should edit per week ( videos of 1 to 2min long ) ?
[10.05.25, 3:56:38] ~ Nils: depends on the video editor, what type of creatives and how detailed your feedback is. But we have a range of editors that edit 12-20 videos per month
[10.05.25, 4:49:11] ~ Yuanda: Full time editor I’d say atleast 1-2 a day or else wouldn’t make sense to hire full time and per project basis
[10.05.25, 6:23:38] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Personally, 1-2 is on the low side, it depends on what kind of video they're making, do they need to find different graphics for each or there are already presets of b-rolls, etc.  

VSLs take a long time, UGCs don't take that long, 4/day atleast, unless you're just testing new hooks, then 10 in a day and most of the time is spent on making the body of that video.
[10.05.25, 13:23:12] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: what are the cures to a ad account which literally does not spend no matter what I do.

Been using them, $2.5 per review :)
[10.05.25, 13:23:43] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: have never happened to me yet I know this is not a huge issue but don't know what the cure is, please help.
[10.05.25, 15:49:26] ~ Alexander Sundström: For asc on meta, we see lots of retargeting on several campaigns. How do you guys setup asc? Do you exclude some audiences?
[10.05.25, 16:34:46] ~ Gideon: I exclude 180d customers
[10.05.25, 16:35:29] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone here advertising E-books with Facebook ads?
[10.05.25, 16:35:45] ~ Gideon: I make audience in klaviyo of 180d customers and also in fb manager and exclude
[10.05.25, 16:36:33] ~ Ben Mansour: If it‘s asc+ campaign allocate 0% budget to existing customers
[10.05.25, 16:36:36] ~ Ben Mansour: If normal campaign
[10.05.25, 16:37:04] ~ Ben Mansour: Get a klaviyo list with all buyers (emails and phone numbers)
[10.05.25, 16:37:29] ~ Ben Mansour: And also exclude buyers last 180 days from facebook
[10.05.25, 16:37:40] ~ Ben Mansour: And update the klaviyo list every 6 months
[10.05.25, 16:38:39] ~ Gideon: You can make audience/segment straight within klaviyo and connect this to fb audiemce. It gets updated realtime. You do this on integraties tab in klaviyo.
[10.05.25, 17:32:42] ~ Alexander Sundström: Sweet guys!
[10.05.25, 17:34:19] ~ Alexander Sundström: We were looking at the numbers and ncpa was not good enough. That should probably be one of the reasons
[10.05.25, 17:46:29] ~ Nils: Is there any possibility you could share one of the videos, like a standard one that a video editor who does 1-2 per day is able to edit? I'm just thinking if we could improve our output without sacrificing quality. Feel free to send in DM and et cetera if the products are something you don't want to share.
[10.05.25, 17:47:10] ~ Nils: Same here man, would you be able to share the quality of those 4 videos per day?
[10.05.25, 17:53:07] ~ Yuanda: It’s a short TikTok style video

[10.05.25, 21:22:01] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hi guys, so far we've been running mainly videos ads for our brand. Recently we decided to start testing images and see good results. I was wondering if it's worth testing images and videos in same campaign considering videos always take the budget? Or it's best to just keep statics in separate campaign?
[11.05.25, 0:09:35] ~ Gordon: Hi everyone, we’re looking to bring on some more video editors full time. If anyone has any referrals or recommendations, would be much appreciated.

[11.05.25, 10:51:19] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: This is the right way ^^
[11.05.25, 12:04:40] ~ Cocow😈: Post id is automatic. You use it when you take a winning ad to a New campaign or adset to avoid lossing interactions because sometimes when you do just duplicate , the post id does not follow so you are scaling a “New ad”

[11.05.25, 12:12:54] ~ Garo Antossian: Hey everyone 👋

Quick question for those who’ve dealt with Shopify Payments issues before:
Shopify just disabled Payments on my store because I’m a non-U.S. resident and don’t have a direct physical presence in the U.S., even though I have a registered LLC and use U.S.-based fulfillment centers for shipping.

Has anyone managed to get Shopify Payments reinstated in a similar situation?
Or is there any workaround or legit path to get it back—maybe through a partner setup, local rep, or something else?

Would really appreciate any insights 🙏
[11.05.25, 12:20:28] ~ Mo: Guys selling in the EU, when testing new ads , is there any limits in terms of cpc, cpm, ctr… where u juts know that something wrong, ads suck and they will never gonna make it…. and at what spend u keep them running before shutiin them down. ‎<This message was edited>
[11.05.25, 12:34:05] Carlos Leeseman: Some countries in EU has higher CPM, like Germany for example.

But normally between €5-30
[11.05.25, 12:34:48] ~ Mo: Got it in terms of cpc ? ( beauty)
[11.05.25, 12:35:24] Carlos Leeseman: Depends on your CPM and CTR
[11.05.25, 12:35:28] ~ Mo: I have +2euro cpc and cpms around 40-60
[11.05.25, 12:35:42] ~ Mo: Ctr around 1.5%
[11.05.25, 12:35:46] Carlos Leeseman: New ad account?
[11.05.25, 12:36:05] ~ Mo: Have around 10k spend
[11.05.25, 12:36:09] ~ Mo: Yes new
[11.05.25, 12:37:02] Carlos Leeseman: Hmm okay, you can try another ad account and test if you’ll get better results there. I’m in health,  not beauty, so don’t know those CPMs. But €60 seems pretty high for me
[11.05.25, 12:39:11] ~ tommy: 2€ cpc seems a bit high 
considering a CR of 2% it means that your CPA is 100€
are you sure?
[11.05.25, 12:40:12] ~ Mo: My ctr is around 1.5
[11.05.25, 12:40:31] ~ Mo: Cpc is around 2.9
[11.05.25, 12:40:39] ~ Mo: Cpm +50
[11.05.25, 12:40:54] ~ tommy: what is your CR?
[11.05.25, 12:42:27] ~ Mo: 1%
[11.05.25, 12:45:06] ~ tommy: so you’re paying 2.9€ for every click, meaning that you pay 290€ for 100 clicks.
if your CR is 1% it means that your CPA is 290€
are you selling very high ticket items?
[11.05.25, 12:45:58] ~ tommy: correct?
[11.05.25, 12:46:54] ~ Mo: No my aov is around 100€
[11.05.25, 12:47:05] ~ Mo: Yes
[11.05.25, 12:47:30] ~ Mo: Im not way not profitable with those numbers btw
[11.05.25, 12:51:44] ~ Dorian: Hi guys, how are you ??
I’m launching on the Big 4 (US, CA, AU, UK) and currently testing creatives in ABOs without splitting by country.
The issue: Meta spends heavily on the US, while AU and CA, which show very strong results, get barely any budget.
Would it make sense to split winning creatives by country when I see clear spend imbalance, just to give them a real chance to perform in each market?
Curious how you guys handle this when scaling across markets. ‎<This message was edited>
[11.05.25, 13:23:01] ~ tommy: i see
how long have you been running ads on this product?
have you ever been profitable?
[11.05.25, 13:52:05] ~ Mo: im profitable on tiktok and snap but not on meta, been testing on meta for a month now, not profitable roas 0.4
[11.05.25, 14:01:09] ~ Phil: Tik tok and snap are very similar, targeting younger demographic etc. maybe you need to try completely different angles for meta
[11.05.25, 14:02:49] ~ Mo: snap and tiktok work for me for 40+ still , but yeah gotta try new angles etcc…
[11.05.25, 14:03:05] ~ Phil: Ahhh okay
[11.05.25, 14:03:12] ~ Phil: Yeah test test test I guess
[11.05.25, 14:03:38] ~ Phil: From past experience too what works on Tik Tok doesn’t always work on meta
[11.05.25, 14:12:27] ~ Damjan Topalovic: new campaign just with the wanted geo location
[11.05.25, 14:15:45] ~ Filippo: I had this problem but maybe was different.

I couldn’t verify my ID so when I hit up support they came up with the physical presence problem. I then went back on my Shopify dashboard and uploaded a new document and ITIN and it worked (for now) ‎<This message was edited>

I've personally shot hundreds of ads of myself and others and that'd take about an hour. Ideally I'd like to get this down to $150 for that ad, do you guys have any suggestions or is that what you should expect?
[12.05.25, 3:41:13] ~ Yuanda: Backstage is pretty good spot to look for content where it’s more affordable

They usually produce better ugc as well.

If anyone was planning to get this done you can speed up the process and take it over from me. Airwallex set up with it as well for HK entity.
[12.05.25, 7:20:26] ~ Mo: Do u have other shareholders/directors etc… involved or just you ?
[12.05.25, 7:26:02] ~ RA: 2 shareholders on the UAE company (me and another person) and HK is owned by UAE entity and has a Director from one of my team. But all shares will be transferred to the buyer and director of hk will be transferred of course.

[12.05.25, 14:51:21] ~ Mithiran: Check whether checkout conversion decreased but everything else stayed the same then it could be. But I think Shopify payments has a good acceptance rate because it uses stripe
[12.05.25, 14:56:26] ~ Mason Schulze: The reason I said is because even the slightest wording difference or appearance of checkout can cause issues

[12.05.25, 17:57:44] ~ Guy Edan: A bit technical but when I clone a voice on elevenlabs and use it on a clip that is 1+ minutes, the audio gets lower and lower slowly where by the end of the video it’s like the character is whispering. This is happening with all voices I clone. Did anyone experience something like this and was able to fix?
[12.05.25, 18:10:45] ~ Nikola Petkov: I use cloning a lot but haven't experienced it. What you can try is if the voice is just getting lower without changes in vocal quality - just raise it from the editing software. If the vocal is changing you can just cut the script in smaller pieces and generate it separately although it will take more time. You can also try new account if you haven't.

[12.05.25, 23:33:40] ~ Robert: just get positive YT reviews to outshine it. If your product is good (it should be) then this should come naturally. Negative reviews are part of ecom and shouldn't destroy your business. The best ecom companies in the world have negative YT reviews.

Does anybody have a contact with experience in OEM product designing (from scratch)?
[13.05.25, 12:40:18] ~ Daniel: Hi guys, anyone got a contact for getting Amex personal + business for a new Dubai resident with new LLC?
[13.05.25, 12:46:10] ~ Mason Schulze: Also interested if anyone has
[13.05.25, 12:59:26] ~ Bony Ghadiya: You can call Amex, get in touch with "global relationship department " and ask them to pre approve you for dubai if you have a good history with them in any other country, they will approve your first card
[13.05.25, 13:00:20] ~ Steve: We have someone who did al our prototypes, did insanely good work. then 3D printed us all prototypes with parts and shipped them to us
[13.05.25, 13:00:41] ~ Steve: we took them to China and was way easier meeting factories with the prototype in hand we could just directly start discussing materials instead of wasting time on design
[13.05.25, 13:00:51] ~ Steve: i dont know if hes taking on more work at the moment
[13.05.25, 13:00:55] ~ Steve: i will ask him and get back to you

[13.05.25, 23:08:22] ~ Guy Edan: How do you guys do animations for VSLs? Is there an AI tool or freelancers on fiverr/upwork?
[14.05.25, 0:33:52] ~ Jason: This happens when you upload a long script, usually vsl. To precent this issue you have to split the script up.

Whats the best way i can build a bundle & subscription section that intergrates this well like this on the product page?

app? developer? a mix of both?
[14.05.25, 0:37:58] ~ M: need advice
[14.05.25, 0:46:24] ~ Jose Miguel Lepage: I think that app is Subi Subscriptions if I’m not wrong. May need a little bit of custom though.
[14.05.25, 0:48:33] ~ M: Appreciate it man that does look like it, thanks alot!
[14.05.25, 5:55:33] ~ Mo: where do u look for stories ( for ur VSLs, adv, better understanding of customer persona… ) apart from quora, reddit, amazon… ?
[14.05.25, 13:04:48] ~ Mithiran: FB groups. Create a fake facebook profile and join if its for women

[15.05.25, 16:31:22] ~ Steve: Yep
[15.05.25, 16:37:53] ~ Ben Mansour: Our tax advisor told us beware of running supplements on mercury or any other american bank
[15.05.25, 16:38:19] ~ Ben Mansour: Because they consider it high risk and they shut down the account
[15.05.25, 16:38:22] ~ Ben Mansour: Is that true?
[15.05.25, 16:45:29] ~ Steve: It's always possible. Not something we're worried about as we're not running absurd claims
[15.05.25, 16:45:53] ~ Steve: Its more PayPal/Strip/Shop pay that pulls that stuff not the bank
[15.05.25, 16:46:05] ~ Steve: If you're extra worried then get some merchant accounts set up
[15.05.25, 16:46:39] ~ Steve: Mostly comes down to how agressive you're running on claims, not the fact that you're running supps
[15.05.25, 16:47:13] ~ Steve: If you're straight up lying about results people can get then eventually you'll get smacked but that can take a long time
[15.05.25, 16:47:50] ~ Steve: And 9/10 it's a warning letter from the FDA. Have seen a few of those in my time. Nothing to be worried about. They ask you to take the claims down and give you some time to do it
[15.05.25, 16:48:19] ~ Steve: But get too many of those and they'll forward the issue to the FTC and the FTC is who has the off switch for your bank accounts
[15.05.25, 16:49:56] ~ Ben Mansour: Got it
[15.05.25, 16:49:58] ~ Ben Mansour: Thank you!
[15.05.25, 17:04:28] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey bro what sort of claims would you consider overdone that can land you in trouble?
[15.05.25, 17:06:36] ~ Steve: In my experience.....whatever the FDA feels it wants to throw at you lol

But in general disease claims, implication of cures, implication of disease claims, testimonials that imply disease claims. Look up structure function claims
[15.05.25, 17:06:52] ~ Steve: Also....they can hit you for "wellness claims" whatever that means
[15.05.25, 17:07:21] ~ Steve: But I wouldn't stress if you're small (under 50m/year) you're just generally speaking not on their radar
[15.05.25, 17:07:33] ~ Steve: Unless you're just running the most aggro click bank type shit
[15.05.25, 17:08:09] ~ Steve: Cancer claims, blood pressure claims, etc get slapped often. Especially anytime you say that you're better than pharma drugs
[15.05.25, 17:08:12] ~ Steve: They really hate that
[15.05.25, 17:08:28] ~ Mason Schulze: So what about sleep support gummies, but claiming they assist sleep only not make you sleep.
[15.05.25, 17:08:41] ~ Mike Ramsey: Adding to this - Shopify payments is a bit more strict out of the group.  PayPal is not too bad comparatively.  Stripe is always a coin flip.  

Any crazy claims / guarantees or long refund windows / money back guarantee will trigger a review and potential high reserve.
[15.05.25, 17:08:45] ~ Steve: Yeah sleep is pretty fine
[15.05.25, 17:09:15] ~ Steve: Again it's stuff where it can hurt people or cause harm that they really look out for. Telling people not to take medication, telling people you can cure diseases with no cure etc etc.
[15.05.25, 17:09:37] ~ Mason Schulze: yeh got it
[15.05.25, 17:09:52] ~ Steve: This is generally true. But  I will note that shop pay is essentially stripe
[15.05.25, 17:10:00] ~ Steve: But they seem to operate independently
[15.05.25, 17:14:36] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yep - back end of shopify payments is stripe but based on shutdowns / holds it seems to be more shopify payments cases coming to me for supps sellers and stripe has been keeping them open when selling on checkout champ or funnelish.

The AI decision making on these is odd when it’s essentially the same decision engine. 🤷‍♂️

But I think it’s more of a shopify decision so recommend a funnel to diversity risk for supps.
[15.05.25, 17:16:35] ~ Mike Ramsey: And US PayPal is okay with it.  If anyone that does good volume (>150k PayPal month) with supps and wants AM assignment feel free to DM.  My contact has been good protecting and stabilizing these over the last year.
[15.05.25, 18:01:12] ~ m: guys, wt do u use as klaviyo alternative? anything cheaper and with flows and reliable etc?
[15.05.25, 18:01:26] ~ Simeon Petrov: Omnisend
[15.05.25, 18:03:42] ~ Bryan T: Is it up to par with Klaviyo? Was thinking about trying it out but was told their functionality/capability is still lacking compared to klaviyo
[15.05.25, 18:04:35] ~ Simeon Petrov: It depends on your needs. But in terms of flows, segmentation, campaigns, Sms, it’s all there. Also user friendly and cheaper.
[15.05.25, 18:34:22] ~ m: Awesome. What would you say is bad about it?
[15.05.25, 18:35:33] ~ m: Pretty soon, or even now tbh, we can code our own software to use in house with AI lol. And will cost almost nothing to run
[15.05.25, 18:50:25] ~ Simeon Petrov: I wouldn’t say there’s anything bad tbh. It lacks deeper analytical tools like Klaviyo cdp for example but the core product is super solid. We personally have had no issues/problems with it until now.

DM me ‎<This message was edited>
[15.05.25, 21:10:09] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Also does alerts?
[15.05.25, 21:10:34] ~ Ryan Leven: Yes alerts as well.
[15.05.25, 21:21:50] ~ Kimmo: What’s the benefit of having an integration with checkoutchamp? I thought these dispute alert softwares tie directly to the payment gateway
[15.05.25, 21:26:26] ~ Ryan Leven: 1. Automation for refunds / cancellations to save you and your team time. 
2. ⁠We push and pull data to/from checkout champ to provide to acquirers to optimize coverage and win rate.  
3. ⁠Every millisecond matters when it comes to CB protection and representments. 

There are a lot of other benefits I can go into on a call if you would like. ‎<This message was edited>
[15.05.25, 21:30:16] ~ Ryan Leven: We also have a no refund, no chargeback product ( replaces RDR to put it simply) that is HIGHLY reliant on strength and speed of data.  

Imagine instead of refunding all of your alerts… you keep the money AND stop the chargeback.
[16.05.25, 17:04:36] ~ Mert M: https://icon.com/

[16.05.25, 17:12:28] Bob: We use this, but has been so many issues, main thing that we now just use it for is as a creative library, but then something like air or recharm seems way better.

[17.05.25, 19:54:51] ~ Steve: her takes are easily the most basic marketing takes Ive ever seen. There are literaly 9 figure brand owners you can find on intro.com for what she charges or even less
[17.05.25, 19:55:17] ~ Steve: people who are actually runing a brand to the 8 and 9 figures rather than someone who’s whole schtick is “use psychology in your ads”
[17.05.25, 19:56:35] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone done A/B testing with or without using the dynamic checkout button on shopify, to see if it increases CVR but possibly also decreases AOV from skipping upsells or bumps in cart
[17.05.25, 19:58:06] ~ Davide: What is intro.com? Not able to open it
[17.05.25, 19:59:15] ~ Steve: intro.co

[18.05.25, 15:26:43] ~ Mikael: anyone that can recommend a app that works with Checkout rules (I want to edit a payment method name).
I tried several different but everyone of these messed with my checkout button in the cart drawer. (it stopped working properly)
[18.05.25, 15:39:14] ~ Cocow😈: Hidepay using for more than a year great app
[18.05.25, 15:41:10] ~ Cocow😈: Ping
[18.05.25, 16:18:40] ~ Mikael: Thx! Ill check these. I tried many different but each one messed with my checkout button in cart drawer
[18.05.25, 17:12:29] ~ Cocow😈: Hope it will be fine 🙏
[18.05.25, 18:31:14] ~ Max: half of the people here are dropshippers xD
[18.05.25, 18:31:22] ~ Max: so not sure if it was smart to share it here
[18.05.25, 18:40:47] ~ Steve: I hired him today for a test project
[18.05.25, 19:36:14] ~ Nim: Yo. Any dark lords in dubai ?! Lets meet up

[18.05.25, 23:21:20] ~ Nim: Cool. Will dm you guys 👍
[19.05.25, 1:30:15] ~ Aaron Ware: Anyone have a good app for product seeding ?
[19.05.25, 1:38:52] ~ Al: In what sense? CRM? Lead gen? All?
[19.05.25, 1:39:29] ~ Al: We do it all manually. VA doing lead gen, other VA doing outreach. We use Streak as a plugin to Gmail as CRM
[19.05.25, 1:39:32] ~ Aaron Ware: Ugc content in exchange for product = seeding
[19.05.25, 1:39:47] ~ Al: We use Refunnel to collect the content and to streamline the outreach a bit. Highly recommended
[19.05.25, 1:40:06] ~ Aaron Ware: Does it work at scale?
[19.05.25, 1:40:09] ~ Al: I mean more like what part of the process are you looking to use an app for
[19.05.25, 1:40:26] ~ Aaron Ware: There are apps that automate the whole process
[19.05.25, 1:40:41] ~ Al: Yeah streak basically turns Gmail into a CRM. Scales as much as you can scale VAs I reckon
[19.05.25, 1:41:00] ~ Al: I don't know any app that automates the whole process
[19.05.25, 1:41:05] ~ Aaron Ware: Not looking to have thousands of conversations manually
[19.05.25, 1:41:23] ~ Al: That's why you hire VAs bro
[19.05.25, 1:41:54] ~ Aaron Ware: Nah there’s ai software for it. Rather slam my dick in a door than training vas
[19.05.25, 1:44:56] ~ Al: Haha fair enough bro I don't know any but wouldn't be surprised. Let us know if you find one that works well 🙏🏼
[19.05.25, 1:57:00] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Try insense
[19.05.25, 2:10:30] ~ Mark Wagner: Hey Jonny, Mark here, founder at Disputifier. We offer this as well, it's called order insight and compelling evidence. It mainly works for subscription brands since it requires providing evidence in real-time of past undisputed transactions from that customer to prevent a refund. DM me if you want to add it onto your account!
[19.05.25, 2:17:50] ~ m: Anyone have a way of moving ppl who are subscribed to recurring orders from a UK PayPal to HK PayPal under a different company name? Tried with 2 “insiders” and hit a brick wall both times
[19.05.25, 5:33:23] ~ Mo: guys any examples of great comparisons charts/table ?
[19.05.25, 7:51:52] ~ Brett Fallarino: Hi guys. For those running a hybrid model (Amazon FBA + MCF + Shopify Dropshipping): How are you tracking daily net profit accurately across all channels? Would love to hear what’s working for you. — Thanks in advance
[19.05.25, 8:08:08] ~ Mikael: Same issue with thid app aswell. Anyone got a solution to this?

All Checkout rule apps mess with my cart drawer checkout button
[19.05.25, 9:22:21] ~ Cocow😈: Sorry , no possible to fix the cart drawer instead ? The problem may be in the other side
[19.05.25, 9:24:29] ~ Mikael: Yeah I dont know. Its simply the theme original drawer. Ill just contact the support and see if they can solve something 👍
[19.05.25, 9:25:11] ~ Cocow😈: Cause the apps hide the buttons on the cart drawer by them self ?
[19.05.25, 11:35:21] ~ Mo: looking for a great shopify dev who has experience working with brands ( not DS) , any recommendations ?
[19.05.25, 11:48:24] ~ Matt: I have a really good one for you and cheap based in Pakistan
[19.05.25, 11:48:32] ~ Matt: Custom coded our entire store
[19.05.25, 11:49:40] ~ Mikael: It causes the checkout button in cart not work if you add to cart then close the cart and open the cart again.

But if you add to cart then click straight to checkout when cart opens it works.
[19.05.25, 12:06:40] ~ Mo: thanks brother ! can I dm ?
[19.05.25, 12:29:46] ~ Cocow😈: Argh shit, maybe checking with the cart app if you have one or a dev 🙂
[19.05.25, 12:49:39] ~ Malik: Hi guys - Anyone knows a great Google Media Buyer ? Or even a German Speaker one ? Thank you !
[19.05.25, 13:27:06] ~ Fabian: Need lawyers taking % of frozen/lost funds. Airwallex can’t explain where 20.000 usd went

Please if you have recommendations dm me
[19.05.25, 13:34:38] ~ Mikael: If a store looses its payment method without given any reason (Klarna) for example). Can i sell this business to someone else and they can use Klaran? trought shopify payments etc.
[19.05.25, 13:59:25] ~ Brian: I have some recommendations from NZ or US they do a great job. But pricey.
[19.05.25, 14:01:36] ~ Mo: yes bro appreciate that can i dm ?
[19.05.25, 14:14:25] ~ Brian: Yea sure ping me
[19.05.25, 15:12:26] ~ Davide: I have my google media buyer, and he is a freelancer. He is very good and he knows what he does, like a nerd of Gads

[19.05.25, 16:23:26] Topi: Yes
[19.05.25, 16:48:07] ~ Rick: name?

[19.05.25, 16:58:54] ~ Rick: yooo ale
[19.05.25, 16:58:59] ~ Rick: how's going?
[19.05.25, 16:59:35] ~ AA: Sotto al pontos
[19.05.25, 17:32:56] ~ Filippo: getting $240cpm on a new product test in US, the fuck
[19.05.25, 17:33:10] ~ Adonis A: Good lord
[19.05.25, 17:33:41] ~ Adonis A: That’s insane man, did you check your ad acct and page health?
[19.05.25, 17:37:55] ~ Filippo: how do I check it? its been years since I did it
[19.05.25, 17:56:10] ~ Deividas Tokaris: We get it too.

Wait it out, it will go down in 2-3 days.
[19.05.25, 17:56:26] ~ Deividas Tokaris: Meta tends to start hitting 65+ super niched audiences in the beginning.
[19.05.25, 17:56:39] ~ Deividas Tokaris: Especially in the health and wellness space.
[19.05.25, 17:57:05] ~ Filippo: what about cpc day 1? lately ive always killed all products in US after $40 spend because of $6+ cpc
[19.05.25, 17:57:12] ~ Filippo: this is clothing
[19.05.25, 18:06:44] ~ Brett Fallarino: 2 options:
- keep spending, over weeks/months it’ll lower
- ⁠switch to new product and keep testing. Eventually one will be much lower
[19.05.25, 18:18:07] ~ Adonis A: Anyone here w experience running post pilot direct mail? Looking for some best practices as we launch this first test
[19.05.25, 18:22:51] ~ Alexander Sundström: How does your contract look with a video editor full time? Salaries? Bonus structure? Requirements for delivery per week, day, month?
[19.05.25, 18:47:35] ~ Brice: Same is happening to use right now. $200 CPM on a new product / acct. from experience keep spending and keep testing better ads. it will go down as the acct gets more history and ads improve
[19.05.25, 18:48:46] ~ Filippo: does this occur only when targeting US only? when i tried spanish or MX i didnt have problems day 1
[19.05.25, 18:49:05] ~ Filippo: how am I supposed to validate a product if day 1 barely give me clicks with $100
[19.05.25, 18:49:37] ~ Filippo: ive tested many products inside this ad account
[19.05.25, 18:58:07] ~ Cody Chaffee: Anyone know a good tt shop guy?
[19.05.25, 19:10:38] ~ Giuliano: Rob the bank
[19.05.25, 21:39:17] ~ Davide: Would love to know that as well
[19.05.25, 22:16:00] ~ Steve: I have 2 very solid editors. I pay them each $400 every 2 weeks. 5-7x VSLs per week each with 3 hooks on each and now asking them for 5 scroll stoppers variants per hook. We're looking to add 1 more in that range.

Also testing our first creative strategist who will (if hired) oversee entire video editing team. Expectation will be 20-30 VSLs per week with the same 3x hook/5x scroll stopper variants.
[19.05.25, 22:16:46] ~ Steve: However I personally write and storyboard all scripts in detail..so I expect high value and fast turn around from the editors since I am literally telling them what I want to see for each sentence in the VSL
[19.05.25, 22:22:14] ~ Alexander Sundström: Sweet man! Do you give them bonuses when they deliver winners?
[19.05.25, 22:25:02] ~ Steve: Not yet but I plan to. Bonuses will onto kick in on video editors after 6 months of consecutive work
[19.05.25, 22:25:55] ~ Steve: Editors are notoriously flakey. You can have 1 doing well for weeks then all of a sudden drops off the map, or gets sick or his mom is in the hospital or whatever 100th excuse they have. Happens often
[19.05.25, 22:25:58] ~ Filippo: Did you solve this ?
[19.05.25, 22:26:19] ~ Steve: So if they prove they're good 6+ months or linger then can consider bonus.
[19.05.25, 22:45:10] ~ Alexander Sundström: this is what happened to us today
[19.05.25, 22:45:55] ~ Alexander Sundström: thanks for sharing! I appreciate that
[19.05.25, 22:58:39] ~ Omar: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[19.05.25, 22:58:58] ~ Omar: Or the good old rain storm hit and no Wi-Fi but his phone works well
[19.05.25, 23:10:42] ~ Fabian: My video editor is going to be pilot so he quit🧑‍✈️
[19.05.25, 23:11:21] ~ Omar: That’s a new one
[19.05.25, 23:15:09] ~ Kyle Twohill: I have gotten the mom in the hospital excuse more times than I can count lol
[19.05.25, 23:15:25] ~ Omar: Motorbike accident or car accident
[19.05.25, 23:15:59] ~ Omar: Sudden death in the family too
[19.05.25, 23:16:12] ~ Omar: But will happily continue working the next day
[19.05.25, 23:16:36] ~ Bryan T: Yup, I get this from nearly every VA I get a month after hiring
[19.05.25, 23:17:00] ~ Omar: They must hate there family
[19.05.25, 23:17:26] ~ Molka Sghaier: Our main is forced to do military stuff in his country so every once in a while he disappears 😂
[20.05.25, 3:38:39] ~ Mo: I tested my website speed on mobile  (page speed insight: 65  & gtmetrix perf 70%) but still when i load my store its super slow, are these indicators relevant, if not is there a better tool to measure page speed ?
[20.05.25, 3:41:06] ~ Charles: I don’t think so
[20.05.25, 3:41:33] ~ Charles: Dr Squatch has like a 1 score and load really fast
[20.05.25, 3:53:09] ~ Mo: yeah exactly so how do we measure that any idea ?
[20.05.25, 4:19:47] ~ Phil: You can hire someone to code your store to make it faster
‎[20.05.25, 6:54:23] ~ Mithiran: ‎image omitted
[20.05.25, 8:31:22] ~ Steve: Just something they do lol i think they all keep a picture of their mom in the hospital on their phone and then use it for time off
[20.05.25, 9:15:46] Carlos Leeseman: We have exactly the same problem with our editing team there. We lost 2 editors within 2 weeks. They really don’t understand what “full-time” means.

They’re working not more then 20 hours and the other 20 hours they’re working on creating excuses, photoshopping hospital pictures, etc hahah.

Also most of them work at night. They say they do that to be able to work in EST/CET time-zone, however people told me the reason for this is because they have other work at day time or other projects they’re working on.

Last year I caught one of my editors working full-time and I checked his UpWork profile and saw he had 40+ pending projects lol.

We also have 2 editors from Madagascar and we see a significant difference. There communication is so good, transparent and really work hard
[20.05.25, 10:38:10] ~ Steve: The other thing we're planning to regularly do with video editors is track them by ROAS and every 60 days or less, remove the bottom 3 and bring 3 new ones in so we can keep styles fresh
[20.05.25, 10:39:01] ~ Steve: No matter how good the editor, they will get lazy and just sort of repeat style. So you end up with ads that look the same always. Really seems meta is rewarding high volume and variety of creative
[20.05.25, 10:50:45] ~ Mikael: Anyone in miami during this week and wana meet? Ill be staying in Fort Lauderdale
[20.05.25, 11:57:47] ~ m: btw be careful with those guys. They can make the score high on page speed testers but irl it’s slow af. They trick google etc with code
[20.05.25, 12:01:32] ~ Mason Schulze: Yeh I've been through this, with one developer that shit
[20.05.25, 12:01:56] ~ Mason Schulze: All you need to do is make sure all your images are JPG format and below 1mb as small as possible ‎<This message was edited>
[20.05.25, 12:05:48] ~ Mithiran: We went thru that too, had to delete our store and remake everything from scratch
[20.05.25, 12:36:40] ~ m: Yep. The pricks don’t care. Will destroy ur whole livelihood for a couple hundred $
[20.05.25, 12:43:16] ~ Brandon: When you duplicate the theme before letting them edit it - you’re safe no?
[20.05.25, 13:35:12] ~ Mikael: Anyone who can help with this? We just opened a new UK company and activated shopify payments. Now they are asking us for this? Anyone know a solution for this?
(We operate dropshipping from outside UK and our owner is not UK and does not live in UK)


Can you please describe what kind of business operations you currently have in the UK? 

Shopify has to follow regulatory and contractual obligations which require that we only provide financial services to merchants who are physically located in a supported region. Shopify’s standards for this requirement mean that registering your business in the region and obtaining a bank account is not enough.

To be eligible for Shopify Payments, you must meet one of the following criteria:

If you are a Sole Proprietor, the business owner must personally live in the country.
If you are a Company, LLC, or similar business type, you must be registered with the government of that country, and also be able to provide evidence of substantial operations physically happening there.

If you believe your business meets these requirements, please reply here with a detailed description of your operations in the UK.

Some examples of operational presence could include (but are not limited to): You rent or own warehouse space and ship your orders from there, you have an office there with employees consistently occupying the space, or you have a retail location(s) there. You may have other examples of operations you have in the country which you’d like to provide: If you can respond with as much detail as possible, that is helpful for our review.

If you operate the business entirely from outside of the UK, you can confirm this also.
[20.05.25, 13:38:57] ~ m: Anyone got a UK Amazon account for sale. Need one. Thanks. Pls dm me
[20.05.25, 13:39:47] ~ m: A bit. But. You gotta remember this. U might not detect the bugs until 1 month later and by then you’ve already made other changes on that theme that you thought was good
[20.05.25, 13:40:38] ~ m: Use gpt to help imo
[20.05.25, 14:24:22] ~ Facundo: Hey guys, is anyone here in the shoe or footwear niche?
[20.05.25, 15:26:35] Marek Olszewski: You’ll need a lease agreement under your company name in the UK
[20.05.25, 15:27:17] ~ Filippo: dealing with same problem but for US
[20.05.25, 15:27:28] ~ Filippo: does a 3pl contract work?
[20.05.25, 15:28:07] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I can get you in touch with someone that will give you residential lease agreement for US. $180 a month (one year commitment) or $1500 a year
[20.05.25, 15:28:36] ~ Alvaro De Prada: works for Shopify Payments, Stripe, getting credit cards, paypal ecc
[20.05.25, 15:30:15] Marek Olszewski: Nope, only lease agreement
[20.05.25, 15:30:27] Marek Olszewski: And make sure it’s an actual physical location
[20.05.25, 15:31:03] Marek Olszewski: There are companies offering such services in the US but not sure about UK
[20.05.25, 15:31:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Some UK people in this group can make some money doing that hahahahha (idk the requirements though=
[20.05.25, 15:37:45] ~ Filippo: @⁨~Alvaro De Prada⁩ what about the tracking numbers
‎[20.05.25, 15:37:53] ~ Filippo: ‎image omitted
[20.05.25, 15:38:33] ~ Alvaro De Prada: you would need to have USPS/UPS/FBA trackings on your orders
[20.05.25, 15:41:02] ~ Mikael: Just a contract/agreement? This UK LTD is new. Just got it done yesterday. 

So a office/virtual/co office lease agreement should work?
[20.05.25, 15:43:16] Marek Olszewski: they’ll check if it’s an actual physical office, virtual office space won’t work
[20.05.25, 15:43:57] Marek Olszewski: and yes, lease agreement under your new uk ltd (or whatever entity you have your shopify under)
[20.05.25, 15:44:47] ~ Mikael: Allright thx!!
[20.05.25, 15:45:33] ~ Mikael: Do you know any good website for this? Maybe find UK office in burmingham
[20.05.25, 15:46:39] Marek Olszewski: I only know in the US unfortunately, but yeah that could work
[20.05.25, 15:54:28] ~ Bazeed: has anyone faced this bug on ads manager where ur campaign disappears, but adset and ads are still accessible? any fix?

I am trying to upload a lot of creatives like 60-80mb each file.

maybe I have to compress it? What is the suggested mbs each file ?  thank you

[23.05.25, 17:32:59] Carlos Leeseman: Some of our VSLs are 1-2GB, and yes it takes some time, but not that much. I think fast and steady upload speed is most important for this.

And upload directly in media library instead of ads manager is way faster as well!

[23.05.25, 17:55:51] Carlos Leeseman: Doesn’t matter at all, like if you have 30 minute VSL, there is no way your file is under 1GB for example
[23.05.25, 17:56:46] ~ dtjon: Yeah bro, your wifi is shit

[24.05.25, 13:05:50] ~ Dominik Olszewski: Thx 🙏
[24.05.25, 15:29:14] ~ Davide: For those who are currently training, or have trained someone from video editing to a creative strategy role, what was your process like?
Because I’m considering guiding and teaching my video editor (he already understand ads, performance hooks, formats, and styles) toward becoming a strong copywriter.
From there, the final step would be evolving him into a creative strategist.
What are your thoughts on this path? Has anyone here taken a similar approach?
I know is a long and difficult process and maybe not the best and convenient process in terms of effort and time
[24.05.25, 15:49:56] ~ UHO: Seen it wrk a few times. U start by pulling him into brainstorms, debriefs, and strategy convos, just to listen and absorb. Then have him write copy for his own edits, tweak scripts, test headlines. Give feedback fast, focus on why something works.

Next step, let him handle small briefs. Stuff like a mini product rollout or a single concept ad. Let him pick the hook, write the copy, suggest the format. Review with him, refine together.

Once that’s working, shift to building from scratch. Give him a product insight or audience pain point, ask him to frame the message, suggest content angles, back it up. Make him present it, strategy’s as much about selling the idea as shaping it.

It’s not the fastest path. But if he’s sharp and curious and loves his job, it’s way more valuable than hiring someone. You’re building someone who gets your audience, your tone, and how to bridge ideas with execution. Time-heavy, but pays off long term.
[24.05.25, 16:41:49] ~ Davide: Like you approach, I would just say that before giving him any pice of copy to write, I would like to teach REALLY well about the Foundations of copywriting. 
See himself if that copy is good or not, and why. 
Teach him about problem-agitate-solution, AIDA (attention, interest, desire and action) all the basic stuff about copywriting and advertising, authority, failed solutions, mechanism of the problem… 

Then once he learned those, he can move on and starting experimenting what he learned, also because we don’t have much time to explain everything, so courses, books, YouTube ecc ecc can be great o for him to speed the process himself.
[24.05.25, 17:01:19] ~ Anatoly: Seems like a lot of work without necessarily any guarantee of success. Why not hire a solid ready creative strategist instead? Just curious
[24.05.25, 18:19:51] ~ Davide: That’s a option sure, it depends of how much cash you have to invest on, the brand size etc etc
[24.05.25, 23:37:01] ~ Filippo: Hey guys, I created a new Stripe under a new company and still got banned after providing all the requested docs.

[26.05.25, 2:48:06] ~ Brett Fallarino: We tested ABConvert, Elevate, Convert .com, and Intelligems.

I liked Intelligems best, Convert 2nd (expensive), Elevate & ABConvert 3rd
[26.05.25, 2:48:45] Topi: We use AB convert, so far so good. Intelligems is also nice but insanely priced
[26.05.25, 2:48:53] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: I prefer intelligem, easy to use and gets the job done.
[26.05.25, 2:49:02] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Yeah it's like $99/m
[26.05.25, 2:51:24] ~ Mo: thanks brothers i’ll check them out !
[26.05.25, 2:52:31] ~ Ben Mansour: More like 399 per month haha
[26.05.25, 3:05:18] Topi: yeah this is also my experience with it
[26.05.25, 3:46:42] ~ Al: Is there any major difference with Intelligems? We're happy with it but if AB is the same I may look into it
[26.05.25, 3:48:38] Topi: I think intelligems has more features

But for normal a/b testing abconvert works just fine
[26.05.25, 4:03:47] ~ Brian: For AB Convert, are you able to do Split URL tests on pages that are not on Shopify? 

Let's say a site that is on Wordpress/Webflow/Funnelish that houses our Presells
[26.05.25, 4:07:11] Topi: Not sure, only using on shopify
[26.05.25, 8:42:09] ~ -J: replo
[26.05.25, 9:56:39] ~ Kimmo: I couldn’t find anything that would work properly for Shopify-checkoutchamp combo. Ended up hosting our product page on checkoutchamp too
[26.05.25, 9:57:11] ~ Kimmo: And now just using their internal analytics to test stuff
[26.05.25, 10:19:30] ~ Aaron Ware: Avoid Gorgias unless you like burning money. My setup was north of 5k / month Just switched to Repli it’s now under $500
[26.05.25, 10:20:38] ~ Aaron Ware: Anyone know how to get checkout champs sales to reflect on Shopify conversion rate? 

Sales are showing up. But the store cr % is not tracking the sales.
[26.05.25, 10:24:53] ~ Matt: Richpanel is the best we’ve found and far cheaper too
[26.05.25, 11:40:04] ~ Mo: do u  use it for live chat , faq ….etc… its really slow , do u experience that ?

[27.05.25, 17:00:01] ~ Filippo: does it require code? I thought Shopify Markets was just a button to switch

[28.05.25, 0:48:38] ~ Brian: They use a different url so it looks like its a 3rd party publisher recommending the product instead the brand trying to sell themselves. Just adds more trust. But we have seen that no one actual looks at the domain so you could easily do a try.branddomain url and just put a 3rd party publisher logo just to get the ball rolling and test the advertorial out

[28.05.25, 12:49:18] ~ Cisco: supp guys how are you ?
I'm currently organizing my creative testing process and wanted to ask
does anyone have a solid Notion template or system for tracking hooks, avatars, awareness stages, and ad performance?

I already have something in place, but I’d love to see if anyone has a better or more refined setup I could learn from.
Would really appreciate it!!
[28.05.25, 13:14:24] ~ Mo: brother thanks ton !
[28.05.25, 14:02:54] ~ Davide: Yeah DM me
[28.05.25, 15:35:47] ~ Filippo: Hey guys, we had a really bad experience with a supplier. On top of that he owes us money because he overcharged us on past invoices. Now he’s refusing to refund us since we ended the collaboration. What would you do in this situation? any advice?
[28.05.25, 15:36:47] ~ m: Where is he located
[28.05.25, 15:37:02] ~ Filippo: China
[28.05.25, 15:37:25] ~ m: how did u pay
[28.05.25, 15:37:39] ~ Filippo: Bank transfer from revolut
[28.05.25, 15:38:17] ~ m: i'd try to get him to give u stock for free to cover it, best chance tbh, or if u knw someone local, try to get them to help
[28.05.25, 15:38:55] ~ Mason Schulze: go pay him a visit in person
[28.05.25, 15:44:19] China Bigboss: Hey bro i advice you talk with their boss directly some time if you are dealing with the agent they can't decide on this
[28.05.25, 15:45:25] ~ Filippo: I was talking like with the co-partner but is the boss that is refusing to refund us😂
[28.05.25, 15:48:27] ~ Ben Mansour: I’ve got some connections in china that can burn the warehouse for 20k, lmk if you want
[28.05.25, 15:49:08] China Bigboss: Very strange have you been working for long time .. I guess you should find way to talk with him personally
[28.05.25, 15:53:19] ~ Filippo: Yeah I’ll figure it out. Never seen something like that. I heard also from other guys that they’re having a lot of issues with him.

By the way, the company name is Fulfill (not Best Fulfill), website is fulfill.me. Be aware
[28.05.25, 15:54:36] ~ m: good luck brother
[28.05.25, 16:02:43] ~ Ben Mansour: Guys anyone tried before to sell in usa market only with 30 or 35$ aov?
[28.05.25, 16:03:08] ~ Ben Mansour: Like can you scale and keep consistent cpa of 15$ in usa?
[28.05.25, 16:05:21] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Not with meta unless you have recurring revenue
[28.05.25, 16:05:22] ~ Cody Chaffee: It’s possible, I’ve done it a few times, I’ve never had it last longer than a few months though.
[28.05.25, 16:16:31] China Bigboss: Hope you can solve it please let me know if you need any help on your new project we are in china
[28.05.25, 17:41:31] ~ 🥇: Hey guys, does anyone know how to get an Amex as non US resident ?
[28.05.25, 17:43:05] ~ Filippo: - get amex in your country first
- ⁠get ITIN
- ⁠open bank account in US
- ⁠amex global transfer
[28.05.25, 17:43:22] ~ Filippo: havent done it, so cant give more details
[28.05.25, 17:44:49] ~ Nicolò: Does anyone have experience and still use shopify payment for subscription?
[28.05.25, 19:39:58] ~ M: Anyone have an insider at meta insider to unban facebook profile from running ads
[28.05.25, 19:40:50] ~ Kyle Twohill: +1
[28.05.25, 19:43:21] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: i need it too
[28.05.25, 19:43:52] ~ Cisco: Can i text you privat ?
[28.05.25, 19:44:08] ~ Kyle Twohill: yes
[28.05.25, 19:45:09] ~ -J: dm
[28.05.25, 19:53:42] ~ Filippo: stripe bans me everytime, whats the solution?
[28.05.25, 19:55:54] ~ Ben Mansour: Apply for other processors
[28.05.25, 19:55:57] ~ Ben Mansour: Like seamless chex
[28.05.25, 20:06:05] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: have u worked w them bro? also for supps?
[28.05.25, 20:11:16] ~ Mike Ramsey: Recommend to get off Stripe - tons of flexible options outside of it.  Stripe’s derisking their portfolio significantly and moving away from fast scaling, cross border online sellers.   

If you do stay on Stripe, needs to be a very focused gradual scale with forecasting model sent into their support team so they are fully aware.  Important to get confirmation of volume forecasting approvals in writing from support to protect yourself.
[28.05.25, 20:21:52] ~ Bazeed: What are some good alternatives? Most merchant accounts have a transaction cap and you have to build it up gradually
[28.05.25, 20:45:42] ~ Ben Mansour: I have set up an account with them
[28.05.25, 20:45:47] ~ Ben Mansour: But didn‘t start using it yet
[28.05.25, 20:45:57] ~ Ben Mansour: Onboarding process is smooth though
[28.05.25, 20:47:52] ~ Filippo: i did use seamless chex
[28.05.25, 20:48:01] ~ Mike Ramsey: Highly depends on region / product and overall volume of sales.  None of my partners cap my clients MID’s as long as we showcase good operational controls on chargebacks.  Most if not all have no cap.  Feel free to DM if you need options.
[28.05.25, 20:48:04] ~ Filippo: maybe it was me, but seemed the approval rates werent good
[28.05.25, 20:52:36] ~ Mike Ramsey: Can also be negatively impacted if MCC is not accurate.  You can bend this as well.  Also, depends on your AOV, traffic, decline codes, among other items.   

On the flip side, processors can have lower approval rates if they are letting in extreme high risk stuff into their portfolio which brings auth rates down for the entire group.
[28.05.25, 21:13:09] ~ Nils: Anyone know a good app for doing sweepstakes?
[28.05.25, 21:13:36] ~ Nils: Like each purchase is bringing an entry, and then you have different prices that the customer can win.
[28.05.25, 21:57:59] ~ Bryan T: How do you guys handle sales tax collection with checkout champ?
[28.05.25, 22:42:07] ~ Samy: Anybody else having trouble entering adsmanager?
[28.05.25, 23:57:08] ~ Cisco: Supp guys important question 

A friend of mine tested dropping new ads directly into the same CBO where his winning ads are running and saw stronger performance than testing in a separate campaign.

Has anyone here seen similar results? Curious what’s working best for you guys.
[29.05.25, 1:25:08] ~ Carlos: Does anyone know where the Facebook Page customer feedback score is located now? I can’t find/view it anymore.
[29.05.25, 2:02:01] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes
[29.05.25, 2:02:19] ~ Ben Mansour: On the left drawer of ad account
[29.05.25, 2:02:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Where you usually find business setting and business supoort home
[29.05.25, 2:02:37] ~ Ben Mansour: You will find on top
[29.05.25, 2:02:42] ~ Ben Mansour: Reviews and ratings
[29.05.25, 2:02:50] ~ Ben Mansour: You will see your page score there
[29.05.25, 3:03:53] ~ Carlos: That’s not what I’m referring to. ‎<This message was edited>
[29.05.25, 4:51:02] ~ Mo: Same can’t find it anymore, maybe meta removed it for some pages
[29.05.25, 5:13:40] ~ Mo: Any good post purchase surveys examples guys & also how to formulate the questions ? ( main purpose is to know why they bought the product, what’s their problems & what they are trying to achieve) ?
[29.05.25, 5:24:52] ~ Steph: Hey @⁨~Carlos⁩ 
I will ask our insider for you and confirm
[29.05.25, 5:27:00] ~ Phil: Yeah that’s what I did
[29.05.25, 5:27:28] ~ Phil: Always worked for me especially when I was at high budget. It shows if you have winning ads too as meta will put spend to them if they are good enough ‎<This message was edited>
[29.05.25, 5:27:50] ~ Phil: That’s how I was finding my winning ads instead of testing them at $50-$100 a day
[29.05.25, 5:28:22] ~ Phil: Meta has stopped this. Hasn’t updated since last year. They are removing it too ‎<This message was edited>
[29.05.25, 5:30:27] ~ Phil: Hey @⁨Phil⁩ sure, not a problem. To keep you in the loop on whats happening - Meta has frozen all feedback score updates for users. New feedback is still being registered on the backend - but not updating for users on the frontend. Our contacts at Meta have mentioned that they’re working on something new for the feedback scores - but we’re still awaiting an ETA on that rollout.

This is what I got sent a few days ago
[29.05.25, 6:33:39] ~ Mo: any recommendations for good Upsell popus shopify apps ?
[29.05.25, 6:50:47] ~ Bazeed: Zipify ocu or aftersell
[29.05.25, 6:51:06] ~ Bazeed: does anyone know where to buy fiverr account from?
[29.05.25, 7:08:48] ~ Mo: im using aftersell but as far as i know they dont have popups
[29.05.25, 7:17:09] ~ Bazeed: Zipify ocu has cart popup upsells if thats what you mean
[29.05.25, 7:20:18] ~ Mo: yes ,how good is it ? ( terms of customization..) im using Upsell Popup by PA its good but luck on some stuff
[29.05.25, 8:15:47] ~ Filippo: DM me I can share our
[29.05.25, 8:21:52] ~ Bazeed: Its pretty good but it follows the shopify limits just like any app you cant fully customize but its still great within the limits
[29.05.25, 8:35:03] ~ Carlos: @⁨~Phil⁩ do you know if I contact Meta chat support if they will be able to tell me my current Fb Page Customer Feedback score?
[29.05.25, 8:35:48] ~ Phil: Guess you can try I’m not sure
‎[29.05.25, 8:59:05] ~ Bazeed: ‎image omitted
[29.05.25, 10:02:18] ~ Andrej: threads doesn’t really matter much imo

[30.05.25, 6:22:38] ~ Mithiran: Does anyone have a contact for NMI or authorize.net?
[30.05.25, 6:35:44] ~ Mike Ramsey: Just contact your payment service provider.  These are mainstream gateways who work with 1,000’s of resellers
[30.05.25, 12:14:29] ~ Mason Schulze: Anyone have a swipe of some good landing pages with offer and purchase boxes on the landing page itself?
[30.05.25, 12:19:21] ~ Yusuf: Gempages got templates for that
[30.05.25, 15:10:40] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hi guys, do you think Shop Pay boosts CVR or it's whatever as long as you have card payment options?
[30.05.25, 15:24:25] ~ Yusuf: Guess it depends on the country you're selling to as well
[30.05.25, 15:24:52] ~ Nikola Petkov: USA for example?
[30.05.25, 15:28:06] ~ Marcos: hey guys is anyone here using dash.fi ? do you guys recommend?
[30.05.25, 15:54:29] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: hey guys how much have u guys noticed not having apple pay in US affects in revenue
[30.05.25, 17:51:05] ~ Charles: We’ve been doing the one CBO structure as well for a year. Imo it’s the best way to test ever. Put your ego aside and stop waisting spend on ads test, let facebook tell you. ‎<This message was edited>
[30.05.25, 17:52:52] ~ Charles: Been hearing from it as well. Ik the Founder of PQ is using it. Seems a really good product
[30.05.25, 19:49:00] ~ Kyle Twohill: same
[30.05.25, 22:26:21] ~ Avriginski: If I launch a new product (no winners yet) with 3 ad sets in one CBO, let it run 5-6 days, full spend but no conversions
Next move: I add more ad sets to test
[30.05.25, 22:26:33] ~ Avriginski: Do I kill the one that’s spending the most with no results, or leave it running while adding new ones?
[30.05.25, 22:27:15] ~ Avriginski: We’re looking to switch to a one-CBO structure too
[30.05.25, 22:58:23] ~ Dominik Olszewski: I already reached 200 ad sets in one CBO have you been deleting old not performing ad sets to do some cleanup?
[30.05.25, 22:59:12] ~ Charles: Yup! I have to delete a few every week haha ‎<This message was edited>
[30.05.25, 23:00:59] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hi bro, this is a testing campaign, right? I wonder do you keep the budget at around $100/d considering the amount of ad sets? Tnx
[30.05.25, 23:02:10] ~ Dominik Olszewski: Nah I have one cbo for everything 😂
[30.05.25, 23:02:34] ~ Nikola Petkov: Oh okay, cool :D
[30.05.25, 23:04:07] ~ Charles: I test everything on a 2 week time frame. If after 2 weeks no traction or bad results I kill. So I would do the same
[31.05.25, 0:16:57] ~ Kyle Twohill: for each product ill do 5 angles each with its own adset and multiple variations in each adset. Kill any that aren't profitable after they spend 1x AOV. If you get no spend on certain adsets they suck and wouldn't be winners anyway typically
[31.05.25, 1:16:40] ~ Ben Mansour: If someone is looking for a good video editor short and long format ugc/vsls dm me, he worked with 2 big usa brands before
[31.05.25, 1:19:02] ~ Ben Mansour: Around 20$ for vsl

For subscriptions as well ‎<This message was edited>

to remove the accent and make it more native english?
[31.05.25, 22:36:19] ~ UHO: I’ve used ElevenLabs for this, but you need a video editor, the lip sync has to be done properly so it goes smoothly and unnoticeable.
[1.06.25, 7:42:59] ~ Errol: I use a agency from the Philippines for all of my clients if you need a referral.
[1.06.25, 8:14:45] ~ Phil: Yea that would be great thanks

[1.06.25, 10:48:46] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hey guys, what's your experience with Shop Pay for USA customers. Can you let me know if it has any positive impact on CVR?
[1.06.25, 11:45:10] ~ -J: traffic junky
[1.06.25, 11:45:18] ~ -J: yes
[1.06.25, 11:45:31] ~ -J: just deactivate shop so they cant leave reviews but can still pay with shop pay
[1.06.25, 12:03:27] ~ Jonny: How do you do this? I thought deactivating it deactivates shop pay payment method too?
[1.06.25, 12:11:47] ~ -J: In settings just click deactivate shop
[1.06.25, 12:11:59] ~ -J: Doesn’t affect payments at all
[1.06.25, 12:46:09] ~ Alexander Sundström: one question about triple whale. We connected TW to a second store and after that the first store tanked. we have 2 different pixels from meta, one to each store. the triple whale app was not activated under embedded apps in the new store. could that be the reason for th performance drop?
[1.06.25, 17:13:08] ~ Filippo: do u guys have examples of faceless clothing videos?

[2.06.25, 9:17:10] ~ Gideon: Anyone has a good formule for using aftersell? Like what offers/tweaks gave youba high succes rate for one click upsell
‎[2.06.25, 9:24:30] ~ Mithiran: Upsell - 05-Copy Accelerator - Week 8 - 7 May 19 - Upsells (OTO 1).mp4 (3).rtf ‎document omitted
[2.06.25, 9:25:20] ~ Mithiran: this is for video vsl but the basics still apply i think
[2.06.25, 9:28:39] ~ Gideon: Thanks
[2.06.25, 10:36:01] ~ Avriginski: Shopify and Facebook are two separate things. Paying your Shopify invoice from a different company than the one listed in your Facebook Business Manager? Totally fine. Who covers that invoice is up to you, Facebook doesn’t care
[2.06.25, 10:40:53] ~ Mikael: Shit sorry. I meant the Facebook ads monthly invoive not shopify 😅
[2.06.25, 10:41:53] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah still, i don't think that matters either, they just want it to be paid.
[2.06.25, 10:42:46] ~ Klemen: Hey everyone,
Just experienced a major spike on Meta about an hour ago - CPMs and CPCs shot up significantly and campaigns are now overspending their budgets.
Is anyone else seeing the same issue?
[2.06.25, 10:43:36] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah I got overspending yesterday too, but my cpms and cpcs are fine.
[2.06.25, 10:44:21] ~ Klemen: Our CPM jumped from 18 eur to 75 eur 😨
[2.06.25, 10:45:47] ~ Num: same
[2.06.25, 10:46:03] ~ Num: frm 20 to 70
[2.06.25, 10:46:21] ~ Num: and cpc from 1.4 to 5
[2.06.25, 10:50:40] ~ Avriginski: If you’re not VAT registered, pay it from whatever company you want. If you are VAT registered and the invoice has your VAT number, you gotta pay it from that same company or you’ll lose the right to deduct the VAT.

[2.06.25, 12:04:36] ~ Ben Mansour: Learning phase means nothing, keep testing creatives and forget about it
[2.06.25, 14:53:03] ~ Alexander Sundström: Same here
[2.06.25, 16:15:40] ~ Davide: Hey,
I wanted to ask if you have any automation in place that sends WhatsApp messages automatically to happy customers (those who have purchased 4-5-6 times from an e-commerce brand), without having to write each message manually.
I have some flows set up in Klaviyo, but I believe it would be more effective to contact them directly on WhatsApp in order to build an experience and a stronger relationship with satisfied customers, and then maybe have a people designed specifically to call directly those happy customer. 
The goal would be to get feedback, collect video or text testimonials, and offer them discounts, bonuses, new products, etc.
I’m using Dondy, which has some WhatsApp flows, but it doesn’t allow for this kind of process. Do you know anything about this?

[2.06.25, 17:03:29] ~ Davide: Yeah makes sense, do you have something like that?

[2.06.25, 18:31:01] ~ Avriginski: This is what we use for WhatsApp automation
[2.06.25, 18:36:02] ~ m: Thing is. My VA went on there in incognito mode and it showed shop pay. Then when you click shop pay. It’s telling her to sign up. Very shit funnel as its not clear enough that there are other options
[2.06.25, 18:38:46] ~ K: i don’t think someone that doesn’t use shop pay would click on that option to pay with then
[2.06.25, 18:49:43] ~ m: the link below for other methods is tiny
[2.06.25, 19:04:18] ~ Brandon: Hi Guys, how much do pay your media buyer and from which countries is he? Looking to hire a vetted one.

[3.06.25, 11:29:32] ~ Nal: Is Omnisend worth to have over klaviyo for emails? Few people have recommended it to us mainly bc of the price I think, wondering what you guys think.
[3.06.25, 11:30:40] ~ Phil: I done it at the start because it’s all automated. But I think once your scaling etc I feel klayvio is better. Yes more expensive but good services come at a cost I guess
[3.06.25, 11:38:50] ~ Nal: Interesting, thanks
[3.06.25, 13:39:07] Carlos Leeseman: Anyone here has a solid creative strategist and iteration system?

[4.06.25, 0:44:44] ~ Bryan T: For anyone with a US trademark, what was the cost of getting it done?
[4.06.25, 0:56:00] ~ Avriginski: If I’m pushing the same product to two totally different audiences (different age, different angles, different personas) and I’ve got separate PDPs for each. Do I need a separate pixel for each page?
Or should I run everything through the same pixel and let it learn? How do y’all usually handle that?
[4.06.25, 1:12:24] ~ Yusuf: We run everything on one pixel
[4.06.25, 1:13:10] ~ Yusuf: I guess if your creatives are good it's gonna perform either way.
[4.06.25, 1:52:31] ~ Guy Edan: About $1200 with an attorney ‎<This message was edited>
[4.06.25, 2:33:49] ~ Bryan T: Yeah I just got quoted 1200 as well, haven't filed one in 5 years so was curious if the rate changed, thanks
[4.06.25, 2:47:37] ~ Kyle Twohill: For anyone in here using shopify with a third party checkout redirect like checkout champ - how do you run for example PDP a/b testing. What software can track data for a/b tests in this scenario
[4.06.25, 2:48:09] ~ Kyle Twohill: i typically used a/b convert which is great if you just use shopify.
[4.06.25, 3:31:50] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone worked with them? https://videoadsfx.com/
[4.06.25, 6:59:20] ~ Bazeed: 700$ per trademark. https://upwork.com/freelancers/bruceh13

[4.06.25, 9:26:20] ~ Steve: So the $700 mentioned above sounds about right
[4.06.25, 11:09:05] ~ LC: For non us residents which bank would you guys recommend?

Airwallex 
Mercury 
Or any other suggestions 

Heard Mercury is supposed to be good but im seeing a lot of people online mention how they ban accounts randomly and hold funds so got me a bit sceptical
[4.06.25, 11:10:53] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Any bank will do that.

But Mercury / Wise / Airwallex / Revolut / Slash are fine if you want fintech
[4.06.25, 11:13:39] ~ Mason Schulze: im going through this at the moment but will be opening a physical bank with Bank of America
[4.06.25, 11:14:12] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I just opened chase

[4.06.25, 12:49:51] ~ Nim: Did you have to go there physically to open with Chase?
What's the process for a non-US resident to open with them or BoA or some other reputable physical bank
[4.06.25, 12:52:23] ~ tommy: There is a cosmetic product manufactured by a chinese supplier and stored in their warehouse in the USA.
I’d like ti sell it, but they do not offer dropshipping services, so I’d need to buy a stock.
What would you recommend me to do in order to test it?
[4.06.25, 12:54:13] ~ Steve: pre-sell it, set a date for shipping, puts “ships out X date” then build a strong post purchase sequence that explains to them the delayed shipping - if they complain offer them a refund on shipping paid or full refund
‎[4.06.25, 12:57:12] ~ Mithiran: ‎image omitted
[4.06.25, 13:01:22] ~ tommy: oh wow that’s brilliant
thank you very much. 
would you put this in the product page or directly in the checkout page?
[4.06.25, 13:02:03] ~ Mithiran: No worries. Product page below add to cart. Make it clear to customers and also send an automated email reminding them as well
[4.06.25, 13:02:43] ~ tommy: automated email before shipping it correct?
[4.06.25, 13:04:02] ~ Mithiran: I mean an automated email 1 he after ordering just congratulating + reminding them the reason why it is ship date is on July 30th. Just in case some people didn’t see
[4.06.25, 13:05:30] ~ tommy: alright makes sense
[4.06.25, 13:25:39] ~ Steve: this is actually brilliant, love the way this is set up
[4.06.25, 13:25:55] ~ Steve: could see how it can be used in a few scenarios, gonna deploy on a new offer we’re launching and plan to pre-sell
[4.06.25, 14:09:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Nah if you have the right contacts you can open without visit:

[4.06.25, 17:19:04] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey everyone! I want to introduce you to our newest partners, Zendrop. They operate two large warehouses in China with a team of over 500, with a U.S.-based support team of English speakers. We personally use them for our fulfillment operations and have found their sourcing and logistics process to be incredibly transparent, reliable, and easy to work with.

Everyone in this group will be assigned a dedicated quoting agent with custom pricing, access to product customization, and ad agency accounts and more. They approach fulfillment like consultants — helping you optimize costs and scale effectively, rather than just maximizing their own margins.
If you have any questions or want help getting started, feel free to ping @⁨Shayan⁩ directly.

[5.06.25, 4:43:46] China Bigboss: Yes Mabang or your agent App if they have one for us we use our platform mutual
[5.06.25, 5:27:04] ~ Mo: No he doesnt , alright thanks man !
[5.06.25, 5:59:30] ~ Mo: I just hired an agency for creatives + media buying . That was taking a lot of my time. Where would u allocate ur time in this case ( things with higher leverage) :
- CRO & offers 
- ⁠testing new pdps, landing pages
- ⁠tetsing new markets, new products 
Anything else ?
[5.06.25, 8:45:04] Topi: If creatives were the #1 needle mover, from my experience should not stop doing them or at least closely monitoring the numbers even if you onboard agency

Often agencies cannot really create anything new, they just can scale what was already working

Outsourcing the #1 needle mover activity completely is not very good idea, at least before theyve proven to scale your ads week over week. Just wanted to point that out.

Cro for one product is like 3 hours per week work so you should anway run that no matter agencies or not

Other opportunities, it’s hard for anyone give you advice without exactly know what youre doing, because its mostly situational.

But what i like to do is list down all my growth opportunities on comparison table and look for opportunities that can have big impact with low effort, or in other words things that you can test fast and there is no big downside if it didn’t hit
[5.06.25, 8:51:51] ~ Miika: Yeah completely agree here and always stay on top of what works and why and what are the ideas they are testing on the creative side. It’s easy to lose sight if it’s outsourced.
[5.06.25, 9:01:27] ~ Miika: I have a similar setup right now and mainly work on auditing the funnel and full CRO including offers, landers and product development. Anything really that could make it convert better and increase AOV and LTV
[5.06.25, 10:33:01] ~ Mo: makes full sense, thanks for detailed feedback brother, appreciate that !
[5.06.25, 10:33:45] ~ Mo: yes thats what im trying to focus on now ! thanks man
[5.06.25, 11:10:05] ~ Mo: i have a question related to how u manage to work on cro and test while working with the agency, can i drop a dm bro ?
[5.06.25, 11:10:55] ~ Miika: yea sure send me a dm
[5.06.25, 14:03:37] ~ Jonny: Thinking of switching our suppliers to Zendrop, anyone here have experience with them?
[5.06.25, 14:20:52] ~ Cisco: Yo guys did your roas drop extremly for the past 2-3 days ?
[5.06.25, 14:21:15] ~ Cisco: 3-4 roas to 0.5-0.9
[5.06.25, 14:22:29] ~ Nal: Hasn’t affected us but I’ve seen a few people mention this due to a new meta update which affected people who have a lot of variations of their ads which are similar. Not sure how true this is.
[5.06.25, 14:23:10] ~ Cisco: Did you have any advice for that?
[5.06.25, 14:23:26] ~ Nal: Unfortunately no because we haven’t seen any changes yet
[5.06.25, 14:23:53] ~ Cisco: Thank you will se if we can change that
[5.06.25, 14:24:17] ~ Cisco: My ads also stuck in the learning phase
[5.06.25, 14:24:37] ~ Cisco: Cbo with 90-150 badges ‎<This message was edited>

[5.06.25, 15:19:36] ~ Jonny: yes noticed a big drop in ROAS yesterday and today
[5.06.25, 15:42:35] ~ -J: so if you have same ad but different LPs it will be affected?
[5.06.25, 15:42:49] ~ -J: or same ads but in diff campaigns for diff demographics
[5.06.25, 15:44:19] ~ Nal: This is the video which I initially saw: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdSYLY4g/

[5.06.25, 15:48:10] ~ Nal: Yea I’m not too sure about that
[5.06.25, 16:22:21] ~ m: Same. But day before yday too
[5.06.25, 16:23:01] ~ m: Are we duping and hoping for the best or spending and seeing what happens or switching off totally for a bit?
[5.06.25, 16:37:44] ~ Gideon: Id wait 1 or 2 more days and than lower budget if its still underperforming
[5.06.25, 16:37:46] ~ -J: Me personally I’m looking at it from 3 day perspective if performance still bad then will make adjustments
[5.06.25, 16:38:00] ~ -J: Im going to lower budget a bit and turn off all duplicate ads
[5.06.25, 16:38:11] ~ -J: Then just launch a bunch of new creatives

[5.06.25, 17:01:36] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: the performance is just a roller coaster with these now, I have tried duping 3 of the best adsets in the same campaign to see
[5.06.25, 17:01:49] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: do u think duping in a diff cbo would be better bro?
[5.06.25, 17:02:07] ~ Ben Mansour: Maybe yeah
[5.06.25, 17:02:15] ~ Ben Mansour: Schedule it for tomorrow and see
[5.06.25, 17:02:31] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: alright bet I will test that, thanks
[5.06.25, 17:09:16] ~ m: Full rebuild of a campaign too sometimes I try
[5.06.25, 17:10:31] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: That worked for you brother?
[5.06.25, 17:27:19] ~ m: Sometimes yes sometimes no. Random af
[5.06.25, 17:27:50] ~ m: Usually I dupe ad sets first. If that doesn’t work. Dupe cbo. If that doesn’t work. Rebuild
[5.06.25, 17:28:17] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: bet i am gonna try that, thanks for the help.
[5.06.25, 17:29:54] ~ m: whether it works or not seems to be more n more random as time goes on though
[5.06.25, 17:29:57] ~ m: hope it works for you

[5.06.25, 21:41:07] ~ Antonio Celani: I have a plug for italian nominees, you can do everything you want
[5.06.25, 21:42:23] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes start with 50, then 100, 200, 400, if roas is still good at 400 spend, move to cbo
[5.06.25, 21:42:44] ~ Mikael: I have swedish nationality for UK LTD. Still shopify psyments rejected
[5.06.25, 21:44:07] ~ Ben Mansour: But lately we noticed it‘s better to test inside the cbo and give each new adset minimum spend so you can test it fast
[5.06.25, 21:44:39] ~ Ben Mansour: Abo testing can suck up your margins if you test many creatives

Anyone dealt with this before or have a workaround? 

It's a US LLC but owned by UAE entity owners are non US
[6.06.25, 8:35:52] ~ MN: Anyone has a connection to Airwallex or knows what the reasons for a rejection could be. Tried to open with them for my HK company but rejected (no reason given) and planned to open on for my US entity as well.
[6.06.25, 8:38:50] ~ Mikael: anyone using Transcy to translate? the translatioin is loading slow asf? anyone else noticed this issue?

[6.06.25, 12:16:44] ~ Steve: strange question but figure maybe someone here knows/has heard of

Does anyone know if someone has built a tool yet to put an A.I. search bar on their PDP pages?

Specifically what I mean is sticking a line under the CTA button that says “Got a question? Type it here” and they type in their question and an A.I. trained on our FAQs answers it in real time
[6.06.25, 12:16:54] ~ Steve: i have to imagine this exists somewhere no? anyone heard of anything like this?
[6.06.25, 12:49:38] ~ Jonny: yeah Gorgias offer something similar, we just got set up with them
[6.06.25, 13:31:11] ~ Mo: how’s gorgias now ? tried it last year and got insanly overcharged

[6.06.25, 17:20:25] ~ Marin: Converge, Blotout, Elevar can do this in the ads Manager
[6.06.25, 17:29:11] ~ Gideon: Okay thanks. But you need tracking software? Or can you see somewhere in ga4/shopify/google ads dashboard?
[6.06.25, 17:29:57] ~ Marin: You need tracking software

[7.06.25, 11:44:54] ~ LC: Anyone here using Airwallex with Shopify Payments - how are you handling the 5-day payout delay? I was using Wise before and was getting funds in 1–2 days. Just made the switch but the 5-day wait is too much. Curious how you guys are managing it. ‎<This message was edited>

[8.06.25, 17:11:16] ~ Ben Mansour: Do you think finding new winning creatives is partly based on luck, say 50% luck and 50% skill?
If it isn’t luck, then why aren’t your team or agency consistently delivering scalable winners every week?
[8.06.25, 17:11:43] ~ Ben Mansour: My friend sent me this and it‘s quite an interesting topic
[8.06.25, 17:11:54] ~ Ben Mansour: Wanna know your opinions
[8.06.25, 18:03:06] ~ Daniel: If you constantly are checking what is working for competitors + do a lot more of what is currently working for your store you should be able to create winners on a consistent basis

[9.06.25, 2:05:31] ~ Molka Sghaier: Same 🥲
[9.06.25, 2:51:58] ~ Mo: My media buying agency ( they also make creatives) that i just hired is slow and dont test enough/not fast, so im pushing them to test more and test more rapidly. id like to know how the process looks like when testing high volume of creatives ( my target for now is 50-70 creatives to test per week). Whats “practically” your testing process for meta, and how u find winners when testing this much of creatives ? . I need to make a clear and efficient system for testing creatives. ( would love also to know  if anyone’s here working with agency and how to push them to test more and test fast). appreciate the help guys 🙌 ‎<This message was edited>
[9.06.25, 4:27:15] ~ Yusuf: Our process is essentially:

Test as many different angles as possible -> Filter out the ones that work -> Make a ton of creatives with a ton of different formats using the winning angles -> Put different hooks to all the winning ads of the winning angle
[9.06.25, 4:28:53] ~ Yusuf: Can I ask why you're working with an agency? If meta ads are your main source of income (if that's the case) imo it's better for your business to have the competences inhouse ‎<This message was edited>
[9.06.25, 4:37:30] ~ Mo: got it bro, how do u technically do that in ads manager ?
[9.06.25, 4:38:16] ~ Mo: never run meta ads ( i only do snap) so trying to learn from the agency, then move in house
[9.06.25, 4:38:46] ~ Yusuf: Wdym exactly?
[9.06.25, 4:40:06] ~ Mo: like the setup do u throw all creatives in one abo aadset and let it find winner ? do u test in multiple adsets ?
[9.06.25, 4:41:29] ~ Yusuf: We have one testing ABO where we throw in new creatives for testing and a scaling CBO where we throw in ads from the abo that perform at higher spends
[9.06.25, 4:44:07] ~ Yusuf: But tbh not that relevant. If your creative is good it's gonna perform in any campaign
[9.06.25, 4:45:18] ~ Mo: yes definitely, so u throw all new creatives ( with existing creatives) all in one adset right, and u launch new creatives basically every day ? ‎<This message was edited>
[9.06.25, 9:44:02] ~ Mo: guys with HK company/bank acct & selling in EU, i pay a lot of fees with this set up just for conversions ( EUR to HKD, then HKD to EU) what would u guys recommend, how u get around this ?
[9.06.25, 9:52:15] ~ Ry: why aren’t you receiving in EUR?
[9.06.25, 9:52:53] ~ Mo: i cant add EU bank account in shopify because i have an HK company so gotta add a HKD bank acct
[9.06.25, 9:54:51] ~ Ry: which payment processor are u using? airwallex payment there’s no conversion to HKD
[9.06.25, 9:55:50] ~ Mo: im using Stripe and paypal
[9.06.25, 10:15:27] ~ Steve: Fire them. Find new agency
[9.06.25, 10:17:19] ~ Steve: in my experience if you hire an agency and they are already below expectations, they will never turn it around and suddenly be above expectations.

Lots of others out there. The benefit to having an agency is theyre not an employyee. Either they hit expectations month to month, or they dont and you can move on clean
[9.06.25, 10:20:41] Topi: I agree with this, never agency suddenly became better

[10.06.25, 12:29:55] ~ Phil: hey, does anyone know a direct email I can use to contact the billing team. shopify owe me a refund and they just refuse to reply or get back to me. i have even sent them a legal notice for 24 hour reply and refund and the live chat made me so gullible that they where actually going to get back to me this time after I sent the notice but now its been 4 days and they have gone ghost again.

They promised me they would contact the app that refunded me which shopify has not released to me and the CEO of the app has actually emailed me and told me that shopify still has not reached out to him.

Shopify are stuffing me around and I have had enough. Any I can force them to reply to me or a direct contact would be greatly appreciated.
[10.06.25, 12:31:37] ~ Phil: PS this is also 4 live chats later. 80 emails back and forth from the customer service reps of the app and still no resolution. The app has refunded me but shopify have no released the money and keep denying the app has refunded me when they showed me proof they have with refund receipts.
[10.06.25, 12:36:19] ~ -J: blast on X @⁨~Phil⁩ im sure youll get it resolved then
[10.06.25, 12:37:24] ~ Phil: Do they even see the posts on X?

This is now the 3rd time shopify have done this to me and Ive always had to do a legal notice for them to reply to me and fix the problem. For some reason for this issue its like they dont want to know me. ‎<This message was edited>

[10.06.25, 16:27:14] ~ Dorian: Hey everyone 👋

I'm currently seeing a 55% drop-off between checkout initiation and actual conversion on Shopify (using the native checkout). I've already optimized my product page and cart experience, but I'm wondering if Shopify Plus could help bridge that gap mainly by allowing more flexibility to build trust, reassurance, and urgency directly in the checkout.

Has anyone here made the switch to Shopify Plus and noticed a real improvement in conversion rates, particularly at the checkout stage? Would love to hear any before/after insights or lessons learned.

Thanks in advance 🙏
[10.06.25, 16:30:32] ~ Ben Mansour: Having 50% conversion from checkouts is normal
[10.06.25, 16:32:04] ~ Dorian: Thank you ! Yes but i want to know if Shopify+ decrease this %
[10.06.25, 16:32:50] ~ Ben Mansour: I think it helps
[10.06.25, 16:33:21] ~ Ben Mansour: Having that timer bar on top definitely helps
[10.06.25, 16:36:16] ~ Felix: From my experience it decreases the percentage, but not by a lot.

I would make the decision based on your revenue only. Or if you use a funnel setup that goes to the checkout directly.

Normally you can optimize the basic checkout already, i.e. removing shop pay, customize translations, use an animated .webp as logo with social proof and re-order the payment methods.
I don't know your revenue, but normally the decision for Shopify Plus should not be based entirely on the Plus checkout
[10.06.25, 16:37:13] ~ Felix: At a smaller scale it makes more sense educating the customer more in better ads, click through LPs and so on. So invest in this, but not Shopify Plus for checkout only
[10.06.25, 16:38:14] ~ Dorian: Thank you for answering actually i make like 10-15k/day
[10.06.25, 16:39:46] ~ Felix: Hm, a bit too small imo.

[10.06.25, 18:42:11] ~ Rick: you have to be sub in a group
[10.06.25, 19:06:39] ~ tommy: can you actually get results in the USA with 50-100/day on meta ads?
because the answer is definitely yes for the EU, but I don’t have much recent experience with the USA
[10.06.25, 19:07:41] ~ K: Si senior
[10.06.25, 19:08:37] ~ tommy: I’m wondering which kind of flexibility do you exactly need.
i’m asking this because I’ve already switched to WooCommerce and i get all of the flexibility for free so I’m interested in investigating potential areas of improvement at checkout
[10.06.25, 19:09:50] ~ tommy: danke schön
[10.06.25, 19:30:24] ~ UHO: Congrats, my dad operates in the same industry and I’ve picked up some pretty solid insights from his business. Happy to share practical tips, let’s win.

Start with $20–$50/day for the first 7–10 days. Focus on 2–3 audiences (interests or lookalikes), test 3–5 creatives per ad set, and prioritize broad targeting over super-niche.

In the home decor space, lifestyle content and UGC-style videos tend to outperform polished catalog shots, don’t even do them. Think of ads as content that happens to sell, not the other way around.

POD is competitive. What makes your store special? Try to anchor around a niche.
[10.06.25, 19:36:53] ~ Kyle Twohill: anyone know how to hide your store from spytools?
[10.06.25, 19:59:06] ~ tommy: ‎This message was deleted.
[10.06.25, 20:00:02] ~ tommy: hide from ads spy tool is very complicated 
you would need to put a CDN layer in front of it that checks for bots but tbh I don’t know how reliable it is
[10.06.25, 20:01:44] ~ tommy: thanks for sharing!
with lifestyle content do I need to work with videos or can photos perform as well?
[10.06.25, 20:04:13] ~ UHO: Photos can perform well, especially if they’re high-quality lifestyle shots dat show ur product in context (e.g., your decor piece styled in a room with great lighting n composition). But if u really want to stand out and feed Meta’s algorithm what it loves, short-form video wins.
[10.06.25, 20:06:25] ~ Erne: I had a POD store few years back and this website could be helpful to get some content, I was using it when AI wasn’t a thing. I think they improved a lot in the last years, maybe could be helpful

[10.06.25, 20:07:19] ~ tommy: thanks.
I can try with AI at the beginning and if it works create some UGC videos
[10.06.25, 20:07:35] ~ tommy: thankss
[10.06.25, 20:47:47] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone here doing jewelry successfully that I can ask a question or 2?
[10.06.25, 21:15:05] ~ Filippo: Hey guys, im getting content for my clothing store, I created the scripts and im having a girl shoot the content. Do you guys usually just hire 1 or recommend to hire 2 (same script)?
[10.06.25, 21:25:24] ~ Felix: Depends on your niche and audience, but usually hiring at least 2 to get more fitting relatability. I.e. one black, one white / one slim, one obese, etc.
[10.06.25, 21:33:11] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you guys ever add new ads into winning adsets?
[10.06.25, 21:36:16] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes no problem
[10.06.25, 21:58:46] ~ N: We always test in new ad sets

[10.06.25, 23:41:23] ~ Alexander Sundström: :D
[10.06.25, 23:42:28] ~ Harrison: Experiencing the same thing on one of my stores, gonna try revising the offer. But essentially you have to figure out whats making your customers not go through with the purchase. Again could be a lot of things. Maybe start with the offer.
[10.06.25, 23:44:26] ~ Alexander Sundström: we are running the same copy of the store in another almost identical market, and there is no problem there. might be translation or payments, or both, that is what i am thinking
[11.06.25, 3:15:04] ~ Mo: Im in Bali too bro

[11.06.25, 10:27:11] ~ Mo: Interested too !
[11.06.25, 10:29:02] Topi: tagging as if metadata or just naming file?
[11.06.25, 10:38:39] ~ Mithiran: As long as it’s easily searchable, easy for editors and strategists to find footage
[11.06.25, 10:39:12] ~ Cocow😈: Attria launched something with it 

With ai it detects the creators , they are soon providing intégration with Google drive 

Not using it for the moment cause quite new but make it a try ! 

You can as well tag 

Attria has as well foreplay and Motion integrated all in 1 ‎<This message was edited>
[11.06.25, 10:40:38] Topi: there’s something called iconik that can work - ai metadata tagging
[11.06.25, 10:40:46] Topi: however, you still need to manually go trough
[11.06.25, 11:24:13] ~ Mithiran: Is there anything a bit cheaper? We don’t need AI tagging, just something that allows us to tag and we can look through videos quickly

It’s a AI that you connect to your ad account then you all you videos with all stats and metrics then you have a AI chat to talk with the ads to see what works, thing commons in ads both visual and copy. And what not works. Basically chagtgpt with you ads and all data from you ad account ( I’m no associated any way with it. Just paid a bunch to get beta access😅)
[15.06.25, 17:19:18] ~ Yusuf: How much did it cost you? I've been looking for exactly this
[15.06.25, 17:22:00] ~ Joel Cederlund: Paid about 2800 usd for beta 6 month, thinks it will be 6k usd per year in the futher. If u want i could send a dm to the guys that owns it and ask them if they can make a preview or we can jump om a call and i can show you.  Not sure if they accept people right now. But for sure i can show you how i use it
[15.06.25, 17:27:49] ~ Yusuf: That's pricey. Would you say it helped you guys scale / Had a positive ROI?
[15.06.25, 17:31:19] ~ Joel Cederlund: To be honest I don’t really know, I’m getting idea and data from it I would never find my self. But they came out with a update last week that make the ai a lot better. Haven’t seen impact yet but forsure made some great ads with it
[15.06.25, 17:32:23] ~ Joel Cederlund: I can send you some screenshots of awnsera the ai give me if you want. Pretty cool
[15.06.25, 17:54:04] ~ Yusuf: Hey guys, whenever we adjust budget or bid of campaigns, they go back to learning again and it's impacting the performance of our ads a lot recently

Are you facing the same issue or anyone knows how to avoid learning?

It happens with even very small changes to budget and bid
[15.06.25, 21:17:58] ~ Best: Same here, have been countless times to both places but I do like Vallarta a lot.
[15.06.25, 21:24:21] ~ K: Tulum is sexy as hell
[15.06.25, 21:25:13] ~ K: The only thing I don’t like is they want crazy tips in the restaurant for nothing ‎<This message was edited>
[15.06.25, 21:31:07] ~ Jacobo Uribe: I’ve been living in Playa del Carmen for almost 3 years now. Absolutely love it. If you come here, I highly recommend the Playacar neighborhood. It’s very peaceful, big nature vibes, but you’re also a 15 min walk from the downtown 5th avenue riddled with shopping, bars, clubs, etc… Best of both worlds.

Tulum like Kian said is very sexy lol. Keep in mind some venues are crazy expensive, I spent close to a grand for a sushi dinner on a date once. It’s like a higher tier version of the PDC experience. There’s a whole term called Tuluminati which is given to nomads who come there with a lot of money and indulge in spiritual activities, wear new age beach/resort clothing, etc

Both are good options, but Tulum feels a bit less inclusive IMO
[15.06.25, 21:39:04] ~ Best: Your choice at the end. No obligation I always give 10%
[15.06.25, 21:39:15] ~ Best: That’s what you usually give in the rest of Mexico as well
[15.06.25, 21:39:38] ~ Best: I stayed in playacar as well, it’s nice

[15.06.25, 23:39:17] ~ Jonny: Whats ur aov and target audience? Always thought snap was basically a teenagers platform
[16.06.25, 0:16:49] ~ Samy: 60 dollars and 35 + men and women. I also tought that before but certain european countries have a really big audience that is 35+. Snap has a tool thats called audience insights were you can check the demographics for each country.
[16.06.25, 0:25:22] ~ Yuanda: Will try this as I face same issue all regular winning tests flopped

Is max bids like bid cap where you set a bid or it automatically does max bid
[16.06.25, 0:31:48] ~ Samy: Yes you have to set the bid
[16.06.25, 0:38:56] ~ Yuanda: What did you put the bid at ?
[16.06.25, 0:38:58] ~ Yuanda: Relative to target cpa
[16.06.25, 0:52:16] ~ Samy: I look at what my best performing fb Campaigns average cost per result is and put it at that
[16.06.25, 1:04:01] ~ Alexander Sundström: is there a tool where you can see your competitors comment section for their ads?

[16.06.25, 4:00:08] ~ Gustavo Drumm: I've got about 10 new hook variations to test. Would you guys use a single adset + 10 creatives, or 1 adset for each creative?
[16.06.25, 4:34:45] ~ Mo: Guys using CK: Whatsapp for automated abandoned carts recovery , are u using CK whatsapp API number or ur own number ?
[16.06.25, 5:33:58] ~ Best: Was using own number until it got blocked now using theirs for around 3 years already without problem ‎<This message was edited>
[16.06.25, 5:37:16] ~ Yuanda: cbo testing or abo testing?

If abo testing I would put 3-5 in one adset

Group then up if they are similar styles too 

CBO testing would let it just run  all 10 in 1 campaign
[16.06.25, 5:40:35] ~ Mo: yeah me too got mine restricted, ok good to know then will keeep using theirs. thanks man

[16.06.25, 19:09:17] ~ Anatoly: The script is very robotic, doesn’t feel like a real interaction, but the actors do not seem AI to me. I think it’s how they deliver it, make it seem somewhat unnatural, hence gives off these AI vibes.
[16.06.25, 19:21:29] ~ Mert M: anyone knows fb cashback agency
[16.06.25, 19:59:05] ~ Jonny: Hey guys, we’re trying to improve our product and differentiate from competitors. Any tips other than researching similar top selling  products on Amazon etc and seeing what features they have different to ours
[16.06.25, 20:01:14] ~ Kyle Twohill: anyone have good video editors they would recommend looking for some work?

[16.06.25, 23:59:55] ~ Matt: Seal subscriptions when you are starting out does the job well and is super cheap
[17.06.25, 0:25:05] ~ Steve: 2nd Recurpay, been good for us too
[17.06.25, 5:10:04] ~ Mo: hey man im scaling with snap too, cost cap ( target cost)  also works great for me !
[17.06.25, 5:11:28] ~ Yuanda: for those scaling on snap is it normal that snapchat repots a ton of purchases
[17.06.25, 5:11:40] ~ Yuanda: but triplewhale shows barely any? wondering if my snap setup is wrong on triplewhale
[17.06.25, 5:12:23] ~ Mo: using TW too but dont have this issue

[17.06.25, 19:54:41] ~ Michael: Hey guys, which time zone in the ads manager is the best for big 5 targeting ?
[17.06.25, 20:51:43] Topi: we use brand protection agency for that, works very nice

[17.06.25, 23:09:55] Topi: @⁨~Bretten Hadley⁩ I use this https://www.trendtrack.io/

But cannot confirm how accurate it is, at least traffic seems to match similarweb and often the products this shows bestselling are the ones actually scaling in their ad library
[17.06.25, 23:10:52] Topi: Anyone doing direct mail campaigns successfully?

Would love to ask few questions

[18.06.25, 16:09:05] ~ Mubasel: I dont think so, if you have your VAT number connected in the billing
[18.06.25, 16:13:45] ~ Dominik Olszewski: My invoices are without VAT
[18.06.25, 16:18:21] ~ Samy: Did you have to upload your own vat number in the settings ( after the application) or it was just without vat from the beginning aswell?
[18.06.25, 16:22:19] ~ Dominik Olszewski: As far I remember before we started monthly invoicing they asked for proof of business registration, business ownership documents, vat number and some personal details
[18.06.25, 16:23:59] ~ Samy: Yes they did that with me aswell, so hopefully they won’t add any vat

Anyone has a reference or SOP for checkout optimisation for Shopify plus?
[19.06.25, 10:51:53] ~ HIM: I’ve used both EUR and USD ad accounts. If your customers and billing are in the EU, EUR accounts help avoid conversion fees  which can add up fast once you scale. I recommend matching your ad account currency to your main revenue source to save costs long term.

[19.06.25, 18:07:09] ~ Al: what's your unique cost per outbound click? This isn't uncommon in beauty until (1) you have great ads and (2) they've been optimizing for a while. It's high but sometimes Meta shows you high CPMs but gives you very high intent users. In the end unique cpoc is king ‎<This message was edited>
[19.06.25, 18:08:00] ~ Al: meta has trust issues lol you gotta prove you are trustworthy and you make content that's great beyond it being an ad
[19.06.25, 18:09:03] ~ Al: you're competing with the user's feed not with your competiton. We always repeat this with the team, we need to make ads that are great content first and that you'd watch even if you didn't care about the product (but obviously you have to have performance elements in it)

Our CPC for winning ads is about 1.5-2.5. Average or bad ads $3-6 ‎<This message was edited>

[19.06.25, 20:07:48] ~ Phil: Can’t seem to lower then. No matter how organic we make the ads
[19.06.25, 20:09:15] ~ Guy Edan: Are images same CPMs? We have images reach $80-$130, especially once they’ve been running for a while and have more social proof
[19.06.25, 20:09:27] ~ Guy Edan: But in general image CPMs for us is lower

[20.06.25, 10:22:42] ~ Miika: one store in english. Currencies are the biggest factor in conversion rate so if you can’t use shopify payments, then you need multiple stores imo
[20.06.25, 14:48:59] ~ dtjon: Does anyone hier do payment processing stripe and paypal with their dubai company?
[20.06.25, 14:49:05] ~ dtjon: Im being told that its fine to do

[20.06.25, 16:23:55] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: Hey guys I am Vaidik Ruparel, 19 year old high school dropout from Mumbai, India.

I am an Indian Ecom King out here. My branding is UNMATCHED.

I have a proven track record of over 2.5M dollars in sales in the last 2 years.

And I have *world class* talent across all pillars of D2C Brand Building. 

Everything Inhouse.

I am at a unique position rn, Ive built a business model with all the systems in place, and I can take a 10x leap from here.

For this purpose I am raising funds in my company and diluting a share.

Any help related to fund raising is appreciated Thank you!! ‎<This message was edited>

[20.06.25, 17:03:01] ~ Omar: if someone invests whats to stop you from taking there funds and moving on
[20.06.25, 17:03:50] ~ Zsombor: If you are so good at selling stuff then you already should have enough capital to build any kind of ecom brand. Don't understand why you would need outside money.
[20.06.25, 17:05:09] ~ Omar: need to use ur world class talent to scale
[20.06.25, 17:06:56] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: i am not straight up asking funds from anyone here, just looking to get contacts of anyone who actively invests or knows anyone who actively invests as a genuine, skilled business owner who is raising funds in his company. 

no point in making conclusions like this, anyone interested can take a deep dive with me on dm thanks. ‎<This message was edited>
[20.06.25, 17:07:33] ~ m: y for tht
[20.06.25, 17:38:28] ~ Mike Ramsey: You can, but if you run your processing out of Dubai and selling to EU, you will have around a 30-40% false decline rate and pay a lot more in fees.  Highly recommend not to do that.  Very bad for conversion rates.
[20.06.25, 17:41:33] ~ Dawid: Im looking for people who want to share with each other products , we would share google sheet and me and my employee would add products that we find and you would add products you find easy as that , and we wont compete because i live in Iceland and only sell here , only requirement is you have to do 1 m + a year revenue and send me 3 of your latest products you have found to see if we can work toghter

[20.06.25, 19:48:42] Fabian: Yes
[20.06.25, 19:54:16] ~ UHO: Aren't we all? eCom is incomplete without some sort of referral or affiliate system in place, I think. lol

[21.06.25, 15:56:01] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Does anyone knows why is it that Funnelish + Klarna gives so many issues? Many customers mistakenly purchase double the amount they want, and it is specifically with Klarna interface, for other payment methods it doesn't happen

[21.06.25, 19:19:41] ~ Phil: Brandwise.
Lets you put all your socials, pages etc in and you can manage all comments and messages in one place. Can automatically hide bad comments too

[21.06.25, 19:34:46] ~ Num: Guys any one have a good prompts to discover more angles about your product
[21.06.25, 19:53:12] ~ HIM: Most people hire creative strategists who understand DTC especially those with a track record in ad angles, hooks, and creatives that convert.
[21.06.25, 19:59:48] ~ Aymen: Just adding on to this^ things to look for in strategist are those who understand market awareness levels,  people who know how to do market research properly ( Reddit, competitors, ect) and those who can look at data from ads to iterate and improve on. Feedback loops are important so they have to be able to learn from every ad they launch. Basically making high intent ads not just making random angles because they are creative 

If you need help finding one just shoot me a DM. ‎<This message was edited>
[21.06.25, 20:09:05] ~ Austin: Much appreciated just DM’d
[21.06.25, 21:42:02] Fabian: Guys what is the best way to make an expansion store in Shopify nowadays?
(Duplicating the store into a new language/market on another Shopify account)
[21.06.25, 21:43:42] ~ Omar Tayara: Thats what i do also because i have a lot of skus
[21.06.25, 21:44:06] ~ HIM: I’d duplicate my current store unto a new Shopify account
[21.06.25, 21:58:52] Fabian: Yeah, talking efficiency, any tools you use?
[21.06.25, 22:26:09] ~ Al: LinkedIn try to find strategists or video editors that work at agencies. They're stretched thin and many are great they just can't show it when they are managing 10 brands. Our 2 best creative strategists came this way
[21.06.25, 22:26:54] ~ Al: If you have the time to train them, there are plenty of great video editors at agencies that want an opportunity to go creative strategists
[21.06.25, 23:26:26] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: +1
[22.06.25, 4:14:13] ~ Phil: Anyone have a video editor that knows how to make organic style content. Keep up with the times and trends etc to make ads not look so much like ads. The ones I’m using for some reason don’t get it. I’m giving them endless lists of competitors and telling them I want my videos styled like this but they just don’t get anywhere near it. 

If anyone could share some video editors you use or have used in the past that are great at making native/ogranic looking ads please let me know!!

[22.06.25, 15:51:15] ~ HIM: Isn’t that illegal?
[22.06.25, 15:53:59] ~ Riccardo Sonetti: I'm not sure, but someone has copied our website and is doing NS. As a result, we're receiving their negative reviews, and despite reaching out to Trustpilot's customer support, nothing has been done
[22.06.25, 17:00:54] ~ HIM: Ahh that’s messed up
[22.06.25, 17:01:27] ~ Rick: dmca?
[22.06.25, 17:02:13] ~ Riccardo Sonetti: Isn’t on Shopify their website
[22.06.25, 17:02:28] ~ Rick: meta ads dmca?
[22.06.25, 17:02:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I would answer to all the reviews saying who has copied your website (add the domain) and what they are doing. Like this anyone who sees your trustpilot can see what is happening. Be super through on the entire story, tell the payment details (when you pay on your store you show up as XXXXXX ecc). This is the best way to have trustpilot do something about it
[22.06.25, 17:11:53] ~ Monaesh: We did a Meta report and they took it down almost instantly. Just threaten legal action and they will take you seriously.

[22.06.25, 22:58:09] ~ Michael: great thanks! How can i apply for that? just the regular process?
[22.06.25, 22:59:11] Topi: We had some sort of insider or person in amex helping us through it
[22.06.25, 23:08:57] ~ Michael: How did u receive the physical Card?
[22.06.25, 23:10:30] Topi: Mail
[22.06.25, 23:11:22] ~ Michael: Directly from amex or did someone forwarded it to you
[22.06.25, 23:11:40] ~ Denis Mihin: Can you do it without previously owning an amex, with ITIN and LLC?
[22.06.25, 23:14:41] ~ Aymen: Anyone know how to open up a TT Shop account if you’re not a US resident?

[23.06.25, 2:48:10] ~ Phil: Do I pay the percentage of sales revenue or my profit?
[23.06.25, 2:48:19] ~ Dawid: Yea otherwise I would be in Dubai with 5 girls each side

[23.06.25, 17:46:53] ~ Rick: @⁨~Mark⁩ the testicle man 
i wanted to ask you to confirm something, i have a product that i have tested with listicle and pdp on shopify and from the data i noticed that 90% of the buyers are 60+ 
i wanted to bring the whole funnel to funnelish so as to optimise also with VSL post purchase etc.

is it true that for ‘old’ age targets funnelish converts better?
[23.06.25, 17:48:12] ~ Mark: Bruh
[23.06.25, 17:48:59] ~ Mark: Not necessarily man, all comes down to the design and messaging imo, the underlying tech matters less.
[23.06.25, 17:49:21] ~ Monaesh: Has anyone tried turning off IG placements? 

I’ve noticed that roas is always terrible but not sure if this goes against best practices
[23.06.25, 17:49:50] ~ Rick: thanks G
[23.06.25, 21:06:11] ~ Musawer: 3 ad variation, 2 copy and 2 headlines, and yes single ad per adset if the budget is not so much high
[23.06.25, 21:07:20] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Thanks brother 🤝
[23.06.25, 21:09:21] ~ Musawer: Breakdown by placement, see if high amount of spend goes to ig and not converting well, turn it off
[23.06.25, 21:43:26] ~ Gideon: Hey guys. Just a Quick question Do you always use a post id in your scaling campaigns?
[23.06.25, 21:45:32] ~ Aymen: I don’t have a scaling campaign, just one broad CBO where I test + scale . That way new ads can compete with the top spenders in the account
[23.06.25, 21:46:23] ~ Moonis Ali: Same for me
[23.06.25, 21:47:47] ~ Adonis A: When you guys test new creatives, how do you structure the new ad sets? Any minimum spend?
[23.06.25, 21:47:55] ~ Gideon: Okay. Hows that setups work for you so far? Is it easy to scale? Not volatile if that campaign is not performing some days
[23.06.25, 21:48:24] ~ Musawer: Yes

‎[24.06.25, 20:29:05] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: ‎image omitted
[24.06.25, 20:38:14] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Also try arcads they are just too good at this and some of the ai influencers there are so fluent that a non Ecom dude won't be able to realise and their voiceover is good too just get chatgpt punctuating the script properly and they trace it from there and after some corrections it's just perfect
[24.06.25, 20:52:11] ~ 🥇: hey guys , any email marketing ai tools you can recommend to generate email
[24.06.25, 21:19:15] ~ Filippo: where to source german actors?
[24.06.25, 22:02:59] ~ Andrew: Thank you for the kind words about Ronin 🙏
[25.06.25, 1:44:02] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey guys need a nice editor under 15$ per hour or around it. Should be experienced with supplement niche.
[25.06.25, 7:11:31] ~ Austin: Hey guys, how many briefs should your creative strategist or content manager be sending out and finalizing every month with creators?
[25.06.25, 7:12:30] ~ Monaesh: How long are your ads?
[25.06.25, 7:14:56] ~ Austin: Man $15 an hour for an editor is high from my experience. I personally pay $1250 monthly for full time with ROAS bonuses and have gotten great editors with no complaint on pay. I get great results on onlinejobs.ph. Picking out the best ones based on sample work and seeing how they perform.
[25.06.25, 7:15:18] ~ Austin: Typically 1-2 minutes
[25.06.25, 7:16:30] ~ Mai: $15 per hour? What’s the level?
[25.06.25, 7:20:12] ~ Austin: For actor sourcing I love insense, not sure if its world wide but in US it's great
[25.06.25, 7:21:13] ~ Monaesh: Depending on the complexity and amount of research it’s around 10-20 ad concepts per week per strategist
[25.06.25, 7:21:42] ~ Mai: Can you dm an example of the work they can do for this number and what’s their daily output on average? I work with a team of editors and I feel I’m overpaying if that’s the market. But our work quality is high ‎<This message was edited>
[25.06.25, 7:22:58] ~ Mai: Also are you using your editors for concept strategy or someone else from the team (script writer, etc)
[25.06.25, 7:24:23] ~ Austin: Man arcads ai is the most ELITE ai tool out right now. Literally every winning ad i have right now is from Arcads and the ability to instantly create new hooks, scripts, actors, voice overs and floating heads is completely next level. Worth every penny even as I pay $500+ monthly for how many scripts i create with it, but it comes down to about $10 per ad, so very cheap. And with a simple SOP my editors generate on it all on their own, so no extra time on my end either.
[25.06.25, 7:25:05] ~ Austin: Much appreciated
[25.06.25, 9:42:06] ~ Steve: Yeah they're good.

I've gotten access to Google VEO3. It's better imo. Using both is where it's at thi
[25.06.25, 10:33:44] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yh i recently swapped to it too I was like who's gonna pay $10 a video but now i can't back from it ever it's just so smooth
[25.06.25, 10:35:32] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Didn't know bro, please do me a favour if possible can you hook me a editor you might have rejected when u had job open on online.ph or just send me a sample design to so i know what to look  for and submit the job post as well? Thatd be really helpful
[25.06.25, 11:46:40] ~ Rick: Anyone here that knows a very good Pinterest Mediabuyer? ✌🏼❤️
[25.06.25, 11:56:25] ~ Gideon: I know one. He just started with my account so cant tell tou about results yet. But hes working since 1,5 year for pinterest as ad specialist. Hes just starting out taking clients as a freelancer
[25.06.25, 12:04:40] ~ Rick: I'll DM you, if anyone else has contacts, please do let me know
[25.06.25, 12:25:36] ~ Rick: for those who are also doing amazon, do you have a designer who creates A+ content and Brand HomePage?
[25.06.25, 12:26:32] ~ HIM: My Pinterest media buyer has been handling my campaigns since the start of 2025, and the results have been impressive, super reliable and knows Pinterest inside out.
[25.06.25, 13:38:14] ~ David: Looking for an upsell app that lets me offer double quantity (ex. 4x) of the same product – any recommendations?
[25.06.25, 13:41:34] ~ HIM: Go with MonsterUpsells or Honeycomb
[25.06.25, 16:44:01] ~ Guy Edan: $500 spend on a $40/day ABO ad with 3.5 roas, but triple duplicating it or putting it in a CBO with $200/day budget perform bads. What would you do? ‎<This message was edited>
[25.06.25, 16:44:43] ~ Damiano: How many creatives?
[25.06.25, 16:44:56] ~ Guy Edan: 3 - just different hooks
[25.06.25, 16:45:55] ~ Damiano: According to my experience cbo always perform bad if it doesn’t have at least 5/10 creatives to spend and test on
[25.06.25, 16:47:09] ~ Damiano: If they are different winning creatives is better
[25.06.25, 16:47:30] ~ Damiano: Try to scale the budget in abo and see if it works
[25.06.25, 16:50:25] ~ Mo: Guys using Triple whale, I have a 1.2 ROAS on meta, but got other sales attributed to meta from Triple whale survey ,  so the overall ROAS is 2.4 , but im not quite sure the TW survey  is actually accurate. what do u guys do in this case ? how do u make decisins ?
[25.06.25, 16:53:42] ~ Guy Edan: Might try that. Thanks
[25.06.25, 16:54:42] ~ Mithiran: Triple whale survey only adds on people who aren’t attributed if I’m not mistaken so there’s no harm. And is your blended closer to 2.3?
[25.06.25, 16:54:43] ~ Tariq: Vertical scaling, push through the day at your target roas and pull back at the end of day on spend and always reset back 70% of ad spend and then scale again next day slowly with the ABO
[25.06.25, 16:57:33] ~ Guy Edan: How much do you increase the budget by during the day?
[25.06.25, 17:02:15] ~ Tariq: 30% every 3 hours if ROAS is still profitable
[25.06.25, 17:02:32] ~ Tariq: If not pull back and do the same thing next day
[25.06.25, 17:02:46] ~ Mo: Yes
[25.06.25, 17:02:58] ~ Mo: Do i rely on this and keep ads running or cut ?
[25.06.25, 17:17:10] ~ Guy Edan: Thanks. And then at the end of the day u scale back budget by 70%?
[25.06.25, 18:28:20] ~ Gideon: You can try to duplicate it with post id. Try an inflated cc at your aov. Lets say your aov is 90 put it there. Start with this in adv+ campaign on 100 euro. If okay roas scale 20-30 % every 2-3 days. If good scale 50% every 2-3 days
[25.06.25, 18:29:38] ~ Guy Edan: Will try that. Thank u
[25.06.25, 18:30:40] ~ Gideon: Thanks. If its working fine you can try bc on aov as well. This way you you dont compete in the auction and you can scale horizontally and vertically
[25.06.25, 18:52:58] ~ Mert M: anyone using recharm?
[25.06.25, 19:12:05] ~ K: does anybody have a contact for a freelance vsl video editor? looking for new editing styles then i have rn
[25.06.25, 22:29:57] ~ Austin: Are you guys seeing a big difference in performance since the Iran US issue? I’ve had a big session drop since then and ad spend is basically the same. Also heard from my google agency that that happens to clients during the start of Russia and Ukraine war as well. Just wanting to know if that’s correlating to your stores as well?
[25.06.25, 22:30:43] ~ Ryan: Sounds like a gay excuse
[25.06.25, 22:30:54] ~ Ryan: Scale can always be arbitraged
[25.06.25, 22:31:15] ~ Omar Tayara: In Lebanon we see a drop in performance anytime a major event happens around us but usually it picks up very quickly
[25.06.25, 22:31:48] ~ Austin: Yeah man I’m thinking the same thing
[25.06.25, 22:32:42] ~ Ryan: Just focus on the levers in your control & silent the noise of probable reasons for drops. 

Just follow the data & put in more quality inputs
[25.06.25, 22:34:22] ~ Ryan: Northbeam has a weekly email newsletter going over metrics across their users if you are ever curious how the competitive landscape is affected. Looks like this.

https://x.com/northbeam/status/1785691965972947058?s=46
[25.06.25, 22:34:40] ~ Ryan: But still, this is the way
[25.06.25, 22:36:49] ~ Austin: Ok perfect
[25.06.25, 23:07:09] ~ Guy Edan: How many edit revisions does it usually take with your editor until u get an ad you’re happy with?
[25.06.25, 23:13:24] ~ Molka Sghaier: 1 revision ( he is a beast and he gets paid ALOT. )
[25.06.25, 23:30:26] ~ Abdelmageed: Hey guys is there any other communities for ecom??
[26.06.25, 0:49:54] ~ Mai: Try to use any “worldwide issue” for your advantage if it’s related to your market. Like tariffs, covid like we had, whatever. Directly to your creatives and campaigns and also as an excuse to give discounts
[26.06.25, 0:50:33] ~ Mai: It works like magic
[26.06.25, 1:29:09] ~ David: Thanks
[26.06.25, 2:39:46] ~ m: Guys anyone got a good trademark lawyer in USA. I didn’t renew my trademark and now some Chinese guy got it and is messing with my Amazon listings. Need to take it back asap. Thanks
[26.06.25, 2:40:26] ~ Guy Edan: Send me a DM I’ll send u someone I’ve worked with for years
[26.06.25, 2:54:07] ~ m: Thanks. Done
[26.06.25, 3:03:51] ~ Dawid: Do you guys know someone who can make me a realistic ai voice or someone who is expert in ai?
[26.06.25, 3:08:22] ~ Mai: for realistic voices = elevenlabs
[26.06.25, 3:09:02] ~ Dawid: Yea but it doesn’t support my language
[26.06.25, 3:09:17] ~ Dawid: Like literally none of them do
[26.06.25, 3:15:41] ~ Mai: Which language?
[26.06.25, 3:15:47] ~ Mai: Try google ai studio
[26.06.25, 3:15:56] ~ Dawid: Icelandic’s
[26.06.25, 3:16:28] ~ Dawid: Yea lol
[26.06.25, 3:16:38] ~ Mai: they’ll get there soon too haha no worries
[26.06.25, 3:16:59] ~ Dawid: I was thinking even creating a ai agency just to sell services like other do just in Icelandic
[26.06.25, 3:17:13] ~ Mai: in the meantime you can clone your own voice if you want. through 11labs
[26.06.25, 3:17:29] ~ Dawid: I will check
[26.06.25, 3:17:34] ~ Mai: I think it works with everything
[26.06.25, 3:17:47] ~ Dawid: Wait like I say something and then I can choose different voice?
[26.06.25, 3:18:46] ~ Mai: yea
[26.06.25, 3:19:11] ~ Mai: voice changer
[26.06.25, 3:19:22] ~ Dawid: Damn thanks that’s what I was looking for
[26.06.25, 5:17:07] ~ Austin: Alex F’s and Mark S’s ESS / EMM group literally changed my life. Many of the guys in here are from there. All coaches are legit and so is the community. All coaches are 8 figure earners and then there’s Alex who’s done close to 200M I believe.  Highly recommend. Lots of funnel optimization and profit optimization. I’ve bought both and will renue when my time runs out.Alex is in here you can probably DM him about it. @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[26.06.25, 5:22:46] ~ Austin: What’s the pay range for a meta media buyer? Probably looking for more junior level.
[26.06.25, 16:37:56] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Can anyone recommend good, fast and reliable 3PL in USA for 2 step drop shipping orders fulfillment?
[26.06.25, 16:39:18] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Dm Me brother. got the best one
[26.06.25, 16:41:41] China Bigboss: Sure bro we can do we have 9 locations in the US now
[26.06.25, 16:44:41] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Dmed
[26.06.25, 16:44:46] ~ Muhammad Hamza: Dmed
[26.06.25, 19:30:34] ~ Filippo: anyones got VSL editor with VEO skills?
[26.06.25, 19:48:15] ~ N: Is there any spy tools for Facebook ad library where you can filter the videos by the length?
[26.06.25, 19:48:17] ~ N: Like videos 3min+
[26.06.25, 19:48:43] ~ Elad daskal: Atria
[26.06.25, 19:58:24] ~ N: Nothing comes up
[26.06.25, 19:58:50] ~ Erne: https://tryatria.com/
[26.06.25, 19:59:11] ~ Austin: I believe gethooked has a feature like that
[26.06.25, 20:00:08] Topi: Yes
[26.06.25, 20:12:29] ~ Aymen: I like adspy more personally because it lets you filter by engagement
[26.06.25, 21:19:02] ~ Mai: Best current ai model and version for script writing?
[26.06.25, 23:36:08] ~ S: Has anyone used aurora agency ad accounts?
[26.06.25, 23:36:29] ~ Léo: I work with them kinda fine yes
[27.06.25, 3:22:27] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey guys need opinion on what to look on the recording or heatmaps while analysing the sales page or advertorial, I'm confused a little there.
[27.06.25, 4:27:09] ~ Austin: I’ve heard the best feedback on copy with Claud ai
[27.06.25, 4:27:58] ~ Mai: Yes that’s what we’re using
[27.06.25, 4:28:49] ~ Mai: But was wondering if other ai is working better for others
[27.06.25, 4:57:21] ~ Jose Miguel Lepage: Is Shopify down?
‎[27.06.25, 4:57:51] ~ Jose Miguel Lepage: ‎image omitted
[27.06.25, 4:57:51] ~ Mo: mine no
[27.06.25, 8:37:17] ~ Matt: Look at the biggest drop off areas on the heat map and that will indicate what parts you need to work on improving to reduce bounce rate. Another ex is it you have click data and can see a high % of users want to read more about ingredient you could then test moving that info higher up the page so more people read it before leaving
[27.06.25, 11:38:25] Fabian: Guys anyone a method to get German mobile phone number?

To bypass proof of address verification, as we have no German address
[27.06.25, 12:10:02] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: That's a really good insight, thanks brother.
[27.06.25, 12:27:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Did anyone get verified blue tick on their facebook page
[27.06.25, 12:27:42] ~ Ben Mansour: Did you notice a huge difference in performance?
[27.06.25, 12:29:31] ~ Monaesh: We look at advertorial CTR and compare to benchmark
[27.06.25, 12:29:50] ~ Monaesh: So if it’s a listicle we typically see around 30% CTR
[27.06.25, 12:32:05] ~ Damiano: how do you get datas from the advertorial? I use google analytics integrated with pagefly
‎[27.06.25, 12:32:37] ~ Jeroen: ‎image omitted
[27.06.25, 12:33:21] ~ Phil: Track123
[27.06.25, 12:33:34] ~ Monaesh: We use checkout champ so it easy to analyse but you can just track page visits to the next page divided by landing page
[27.06.25, 12:33:38] ~ Phil: Hides all Chinese stuff on your order tracking
[27.06.25, 12:34:06] ~ Damiano: thank you
[27.06.25, 12:34:30] ~ Jeroen: Thx bro gonna check!
[27.06.25, 13:46:16] ~ Tijn Fortuin: somebody using payoneer in HK, pb please
[27.06.25, 14:58:44] ~ Nils: Anyone in here have experience with FTC/FDA compliance?
[27.06.25, 17:50:22] ~ Anatoly: If you work with 3PL, you can ask them to provide last mile tracking instead of YunExpress, in which case your customers will see USPS number (if shipping to US), but they won’t be able to track the order until after it made it to the recipient’s country.
[27.06.25, 17:51:26] ~ Jeroen: Yeah but than they don’t see any updates at parcel panel until the last few days.
[27.06.25, 17:53:54] ~ Anatoly: Why do you not want customers to see YunExpress number in the first place? I’ve been selling some premium products using this method (showing yunexpress numvers) and never ones had a customer complaining the product comes from china. If your brand and product positioning are in order, they won’t care much. ‎<This message was edited>
[27.06.25, 17:54:59] ~ Steve: Depends on the product category and where you are selling
[27.06.25, 17:55:23] ~ Steve: we regularly get customers who are excited about the product and then email us after they see its from China and immediate refund on that
[27.06.25, 17:55:25] ~ Steve: aggressively too
[27.06.25, 17:55:40] ~ Steve: especially since tarrif stuff - buy American has never been more popular
[27.06.25, 17:56:24] ~ Anatoly: Wow, thats odd. Are you selling supplements by any chance? Otherwise, I am not sure why anyone would have a problem with it?
[27.06.25, 17:56:29] ~ Steve: European customers seem to care much less
[27.06.25, 17:56:33] ~ Steve: Yes, supplements
[27.06.25, 17:56:47] ~ Steve: but even other products have had that as well, mostly just for US customers.
[27.06.25, 18:01:00] Topi: This issue can be solved by using 3rd party tool for tracking updates such as parcel panel

Then you simply ask your supplier stop sending tracking updates themselves
[27.06.25, 18:07:16] ~ Nico: anyone crushing it with x ads ?
[27.06.25, 19:03:04] ~ UHO: I am!
[27.06.25, 21:32:55] ~ Guy Edan: Do u guys know if we can use the word “Botox” or in our ads or do we need to say “injectables” or something like that?
[27.06.25, 21:36:44] ~ S: Botox is fine
[27.06.25, 21:45:01] ~ Davide: Just on Google ads I saw there are some problems using Botox
[27.06.25, 21:50:21] ~ S: With meta is fine, we didnt have issues with it so far
[27.06.25, 21:56:58] ~ Aymen: Anyone know a TikTok agency ad account plug? Got my ad account suspended and need a new one created under a business center
[27.06.25, 23:43:31] ~ Shri Kanase: I have a friend who runs one of the best, dm me if still needed!
[28.06.25, 1:41:04] ~ Dawid: Does anyone know a website that lets you use ai to answer calls?
[28.06.25, 5:59:56] ~ RA: but even Chinese people dont buy supplements from china😂. Couple of bad suppliers broke the trust.

I think these stories are known globally. 

It's 1 thing to receive a bad product from china but something else to ingest potentially toxic substance.
[28.06.25, 7:10:11] ~ Gordon: Hi does anyone have any connects to aged instagram account sellers? Thanks
‎[28.06.25, 9:33:42] ~ Daniel: ‎image omitted
[28.06.25, 10:40:45] Topi: I know some
[28.06.25, 11:11:00] ~ Steve: I think it's a historical reputation that's hard to live down and will persist for a long time. Especially in certain industries like pet food (although most people would be shocked at how many big brand pet supps still come from china)

Also many large supp manufacturers will ship supplements in bulk powder from china and Capsule it in US and claim "made in USA" simply because there's a alot of supps that you can't really source that well in the US.
[28.06.25, 11:12:12] ~ Steve: But after traveling to china a few times and visiting half a dozen facilities I was extremely impressed by a lot of them for cleanliness, organization, high tech etc. I've been working in supps marketing for so long my assumption was just China is gonna have these terrible, old school facilities but it was the opposite
[28.06.25, 11:12:50] ~ Steve: Plus you just get treated better as a business person there. Unless you're going to a US manufacturer with a 100,000 capsule MOQ or more, they basically tell you to fuck yourself
[28.06.25, 11:13:15] ~ Steve: Where as the Chinese teams treat you and your business very well.

You just have to 3rd party test your stuff when it arrives in the US
[28.06.25, 11:15:57] China Bigboss: yup totally agree on this Steve, I signed some exclusive contracts with the top of them, they have all the neede,d and they are super professional when it comes to the ingredients and packing some of them with more than 10 billion turnover.. many of our clients ship thousands of orders with zero issue
[28.06.25, 11:17:48] ~ Mason Schulze: Just got back from China and visited a few supplement factories, absolutely spotless clean. Of course there would be bad ones also..
[28.06.25, 11:18:17] ~ Steve: Yeah we were honestly really impressed at the facilities we visited.
[28.06.25, 11:18:41] ~ Mason Schulze: tried to go down the path of manufacturing in AUS cost was almost double and lead time tripple
[28.06.25, 11:18:49] ~ Mason Schulze: impossible
[28.06.25, 11:21:41] China Bigboss: i guess in many fields it's hard to compete with the Chinese factories, they are in a different Era now :)
[28.06.25, 14:36:49] ~ Omar Tayara: i have a friend building the largest pet food factory in the middle east. if anyone’s interested i’ll connect you
[28.06.25, 17:38:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Is anyone here running taboola ads?
[28.06.25, 17:52:45] ~ Cocow😈: ‎This message was deleted.
[28.06.25, 17:53:25] ~ Cocow😈: We launched last month with really low spend to test traction and validate if we should invest more time on it
[28.06.25, 18:08:59] ~ Avriginski: Does anyone know of a cart drawer app that allows Shipping Insurance to be default ON?

I’ve tried several apps, but they all show the message:
“Shopify is implementing a change to enhance buyer trust by preventing apps from automatically adding non-free items.”

I’ve seen plenty of stores that still have it set as active by default, anyone know a workaround or how they’re doing it?
[28.06.25, 18:10:57] ~ Mai: I think that in shrine theme it’s still like that. Using Upcart too and not sure if they still have it on as default
[28.06.25, 18:11:51] ~ Erne: Shrine theme or dev using up cart app ‎<This message was edited>
[28.06.25, 18:11:51] ~ Mai: In shrine theme you should create a product, call it “shipping insurance” and make it on as default
[28.06.25, 18:13:20] ~ Mai: Do you have the code to put there?
[28.06.25, 18:14:16] ~ Mai: In the app
[28.06.25, 18:16:22] ~ Erne: It’s not in the app but in the theme. Idk where he put it exactly. If you want I can share the dev I used
[28.06.25, 18:31:22] ~ Felix: Is anyone running ads on TruthSocial here? Such an interesting audience there 😆
[28.06.25, 18:35:01] ~ Steve: If I was in survival products niche I'd look to run there for sure

[29.06.25, 0:37:42] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Hey guys, anyone has experiences with Hong Kong Ltd for selling in Europe? Experiencs on using Airwallex, reserves/holds, etc
[29.06.25, 0:57:47] ~ S: I know some people get payment holds or have their Airwallex accounts suspended if their dispute rate is too high. But as long as you’re not doing anything blackhat, you should be fine. We've been using it for the past 2 years and no issues so far
[29.06.25, 1:11:04] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Thank you. And did you have any holds at all? For example when you transferred your sales from your previous processor to them
[29.06.25, 1:17:57] ~ S: We have but as long as you send the docs they request, it's all good
[29.06.25, 1:18:54] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: In Stripe for example, they've put me a 25% hold and then I sent the docs they wanted and still kept the hold 🤣
[29.06.25, 1:19:20] ~ Alexander Sundström: we are looking for a native video editor in the nordics. if you know someone, pm me that would be very appreciated!

[29.06.25, 8:57:46] ~ Manoj Bashyal: are you using triple whale?
[29.06.25, 8:58:17] ~ Jeroen: Yes
[29.06.25, 9:02:14] ~ Jeroen: We had other tracking installed and recently switched to Triple Whale because we heard it would help. However, we need to check if everything is set up correctly because we no longer see any sales in our TikTok, and yesterday, one of our Facebook accounts also showed some strange tracking data.
[29.06.25, 9:03:02] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Feel free to hit me up, happy to help you real quick

[29.06.25, 16:57:25] ~ Nal: threaten a lawsuit against the competitor? or meta? 🤣
[29.06.25, 16:57:32] ~ Nal: @⁨~Monaesh⁩
[29.06.25, 16:57:58] ~ Nal: we have already sent emails to comp directly
[29.06.25, 16:58:18] ~ Monaesh: Is it content you filmed yourself ?
[29.06.25, 16:58:34] ~ Nal: UGC content we paid for
[29.06.25, 16:59:25] ~ Monaesh: If so just say the actors want to file a lawsuit for unauthorised usage of their content and attach your photo release forms to the complaint
[29.06.25, 16:59:45] ~ Nal: perfect, thanks

For example:

[30.06.25, 16:37:18] ~ Zsombor: Yes it's fine
[30.06.25, 20:44:23] ~ Carlos: i'm seeing a big dip in performance across all my stores on Meta in the last few days, with today being the wost day by far. Are you guys seeing the same or is it skill issue? 😅 In my experience performance gets unstable whenever Meta introduces changes to the platform, I'd love to have an index to check global performance
[30.06.25, 20:45:23] ~ Ezarya Khamiss: Hi @⁨~Carlos⁩ what accounts are you running on?
[30.06.25, 20:47:19] ~ Carlos: what do you mean? it's all on personal accounts, I don't do agencies
[30.06.25, 20:50:48] ~ Matt: Same CAC has doubled

[1.07.25, 1:12:18] ~ Nico: Same on one shop which market?
[1.07.25, 1:19:04] ~ Carlos: across all markets and different niches to be honest. My main store is US but I also run an EU store and it's down as well
[1.07.25, 1:24:59] ~ Dawid: Same here
[1.07.25, 4:30:08] ~ Mo: anyone knows how to get new Wise biz acct after getting restricted ?
[1.07.25, 4:33:21] ~ Monaesh: We’re US market and performance has been great
[1.07.25, 10:29:58] ~ Miika: Performance is decent but not great for us, fathers’ day weekend was a clear the peak for last month
[1.07.25, 10:33:10] ~ Miika: I’ve heard Temu is ramping up in the US again but not sure if that would be noticeable in overall meta performance
[1.07.25, 10:35:45] ~ Erne: Knowing that other people have bad performances doesn’t do any good for you bro. Just make better ads and focus on what you can control. While you’re having your “worst days ever” there are people that are making their best days ever. I don’t think does any good asking this questions. Not trying be a dickhead but we often use this “excuse” as a coping mechanism and if other people are also doing bad we just chill thinking that we cannot do anything about that ‎<This message was edited>
[1.07.25, 10:39:53] ~ Jonathan Bech Mayer: couldn't agree more.
[1.07.25, 10:39:56] ~ Miika: Very true! you’d also need a lot of data to draw any conclusions from
[1.07.25, 10:54:07] ~ Žan: This guy is smart
[1.07.25, 10:58:04] ~ Matt: Yh very true 1 of my stores is doing awful and my other one is 60% up YOY
[1.07.25, 11:36:24] ~ David: None of our upsells go through bc of a "failed payment" issue. The order stays partial.
Does anyone using AfterSell have the same issue?
[1.07.25, 12:06:09] ~ Gideon: Anyone has a good shopify app for deals like 3+1 free?
[1.07.25, 12:06:35] Topi: depending on what you wanna achieve but free gift setup is super easy with app called BOGOS
[1.07.25, 12:09:25] ~ Gideon: Okay thanks. Will check it out. My bestseller has 5 variants. So if they add 3 of them they can choose 1 variant as a gift. Like this
[1.07.25, 14:43:43] ~ Jonny: Anyone know a website or software to buy engagement for ads? Looking for ‘real’ looking comments, not chad ones
[1.07.25, 14:45:22] Topi: I know a service

You can either create the engagement yourself of have them do it
[1.07.25, 14:45:47] ~ Phil: What’s this service bro?
[1.07.25, 15:52:56] ~ Davide: have you guys found a better image gen than ChatGPT?

[1.07.25, 17:01:23] ~ Neeraj: hey guys, looking for a full time VSL video editor. any leads for someone excellent are appreciated!
[1.07.25, 18:00:53] ~ Kyle Twohill: can you pay facebook monthly invoicing with a credit card? or is it just bank transfer?
[1.07.25, 18:01:59] ~ Gideon: I use amex. You can get a lot of points and advantages
[1.07.25, 18:02:40] ~ Kyle Twohill: yeah right now i do the same. But im saying if you have the net 30 payment terms with facebook can you still use a card?
[1.07.25, 18:05:07] ~ Gideon: I think its bank transfer only. Thats why i didnt do it yet and use cc option.
[1.07.25, 19:00:20] ~ Carlos: Yeah, absolutely. I wasn't looking for excuses or validation, I've been in the game for a while now. 
But I understand that it might have a been a low quality question 

I do think it's genuinely useful to have a feel for how the platform is delivering as a whole. It's clear by the responses I got that it's business as usual and it's just my strategy that needs work, we move!
[1.07.25, 20:08:16] ~ Matt: No but you can use services like apron to put invoices via a cc
[1.07.25, 20:08:40] ~ Matt: But will pay an extra 2% ish
[1.07.25, 20:08:56] ~ Matt: Still cheaper then most rev based finance providers
[1.07.25, 20:09:50] ~ Austin: What’s the KPI’s you guys set for video editors? How much output do they need to produce per week?
[1.07.25, 22:30:23] ~ Nils: Minutes of edited footage finished.
[1.07.25, 22:30:44] ~ Nils: Output depends on how edited you want it to be and how much quality you want.
[1.07.25, 22:36:15] ~ Austin: What’s your requirements for total footage output per week? EX: 20 minutes?
[1.07.25, 22:51:55] ~ Christopher Murphy: 2 min of edited content/day is our KPI for VE
[1.07.25, 22:56:58] ~ Facundo: How do u measure this once u do hook or scroll stoppers tests? Because those are just 1/5 seconds
[1.07.25, 23:08:03] ~ Christopher Murphy: It’s hard to track. This metric is better for net new editors. However right now they add up the iteration seconds they edit of all the content they added to frame. But often times it ends up being negligible
[1.07.25, 23:28:06] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. My personal account got restricted cause of a weird 2FA bug and because of the restriction I can’t edit/publish ads or even give someone else access to the ad account to manage it from their side.

Does anyone have an insider that could help fix this?
[2.07.25, 0:03:23] ~ Filippo: I got u

[2.07.25, 3:47:04] ~ Tariq: anyone here scaling in Germany or Mexico ?
[2.07.25, 3:50:58] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I use triple whale in general but I have a VA maintaining a universal spreadsheet and then a spreadsheet for each store because that's better way for me to make the next day decisions.
[2.07.25, 3:51:40] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: But I heard redtrack for Ecom is more advanced, I have a affiliate marketer friend he was suggesting me...
[2.07.25, 3:55:06] ~ Mo: u using Sonar ?
[2.07.25, 21:40:37] ~ Lucas Alves: guys someone using this simple structure?

[2.07.25, 22:26:36] ~ Steve: In my experience, the best native ads course is honestly just buying native ads
[2.07.25, 22:26:42] ~ Steve: and figure out as you go - maybe find a solid native ad media buyer

[3.07.25, 14:26:24] ~ Manoj Bashyal: DM me bro, happy to help
[3.07.25, 14:27:51] ~ Manoj Bashyal: I had scaled store in Czech, Slovakia previously
[3.07.25, 15:16:49] ~ Nim: maybe try cross-referencing with Wetracked X Klaviyo integration. If you're already using Wetracked, that is
[3.07.25, 17:03:14] ~ Guy Edan: Looking at our heatmap, we have a lot of people clicking on the headline of the advertorial - what would you do with that? I thought about either making it scroll down to continue reading the article, or to just transfer them to the next page. Any thoughts?
[3.07.25, 17:04:03] ~ Manoj Bashyal: What is the text color of the headline?
[3.07.25, 17:04:39] ~ Guy Edan: Simple black text on a white background. It doesn’t look like a button at all
[3.07.25, 17:06:42] ~ Manoj Bashyal: weird, can you dm me the url? Would love to check it out and see what is the real issue. Isn’t it clear for the visitors that it is supposed to be scrolling, instead of clicking the headline?
[3.07.25, 17:16:36] ~ Rick: Is there a CTA in the headline?
[3.07.25, 17:29:09] ~ Filippo: whats the scale like over there?
[3.07.25, 17:39:47] ~ Tariq: anyone scaling in Germany ?
[3.07.25, 18:07:32] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Have scaled up to 6 figures/mo, but the market it comparatively smaller for 7 fig/mo
[3.07.25, 18:49:00] ~ Andrej: Yea
[3.07.25, 18:49:51] ~ Andrej: Lmk if you have any questions or want someone to take a look. Using triple whale across 7 stores and getting great results.
[3.07.25, 18:52:03] ~ Damiano: How big is the market in your experience? Can it sustain 7 figures per month for the whole year?
[3.07.25, 19:05:52] ~ Andrej: Yes, for sure. If you’re in a mass market industry. Especially if you count in switzerland and austria. But even with germany alone.
[4.07.25, 0:09:35] ~ Guy Edan: I understood that meta doesn’t allow using celebrities in ads, but I see many ads similar to this: https://www.facebook.com/100093278524872/posts/449231024862845

Can someone shed some light on it? Did they use to allow it and now it changed?
[4.07.25, 2:33:41] ~ Aymen: We usually just blur out the face of the celebrity and we are good. If it is a big celebrity like drake most people will recognize them immediately anyways. We never include any names
[4.07.25, 3:27:04] ~ Mo: is the cost per ATC and IC accurate in your TW ? mine are not
[4.07.25, 9:37:33] ~ Chris: Anyone using AI agent for creative strategist and graphic designer?

[6.07.25, 15:23:19] ~ N: U upload from ur desktop instead of drive
[6.07.25, 15:23:52] ~ Johir.E: can vouch, my editors use it regularly everyday never a problem using it for them
[6.07.25, 15:48:10] ~ Cocow😈: Down load the gdrive app , Connect it to your computer and you are going to have your files synchronized in your computer folders

[7.07.25, 3:36:08] ~ Cody Chaffee: Shrine atc is cooked sometimes. Use an app like monster cart instead
[7.07.25, 4:57:52] ~ Brian: My marketing team is at capacity right now and I don't want their focus to go away from what is making us money. Also agencies bring expertise with them that is valuable.
[7.07.25, 4:58:13] ~ Brian: Still looking for an influencer agency that can help with whitelisted ads. Anybody knows a good one?
[7.07.25, 6:11:43] ~ Mo: I have 2 funnels in one funnelish  acct each for a country, and I have 2 separate shopify stores. No way to connect 2 different shopify stores with the same funnelish acct right ?

[7.07.25, 10:41:55] ~ AK: Postscript or sms bump is good
[7.07.25, 10:42:02] ~ AK: SMS bump is little bit cheaper
[7.07.25, 10:42:36] ~ Rick: txt cart
[7.07.25, 10:43:11] ~ Rick: what's youe ROI?
[7.07.25, 10:46:06] ~ AK: It’s pretty good usually with flows 

20-30x ROI

With campaigns bit hard to get results for dropshipping stores
[7.07.25, 11:05:36] ~ Mo: They support Eu countries ?
[7.07.25, 11:06:18] ~ AK: Not all but yes most of them
[7.07.25, 11:07:21] ~ AK: I guess you can send SMS but not MMS

[7.07.25, 17:37:30] ~ tommy: i agree.
perfect integration with WooCommerce, no slowdowns in website speed
[7.07.25, 18:08:03] ~ Filippo: hey guys, setting up funnelish for my store but i forgot how to do some stuff and support is not helping.

[7.07.25, 23:27:46] ~ Guy Edan: Is Chat GPT the best for creating AI images or is there a different app that does a better job?
[7.07.25, 23:28:37] ~ Moonis Ali: Chat gpt and kling both are good
[8.07.25, 1:14:14] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Ideogram is great for expanding images you get with GPT and anything where you need ultra realism that doesn’t include a product. Background swaps on there are decent for product images, but you can’t fully recreate it like you can inside GPT
[8.07.25, 2:16:32] ~ Kyle Twohill: is anyone notice a huge spike in chargebacks after running post purchase upsells with checkout champ?
[8.07.25, 3:16:16] ~ Matthew Martorano: Hey Kyle, do you have them set as individual sales or bundled in the original purchase transaction?
[8.07.25, 3:19:23] ~ Kyle Twohill: I’ll dm
[8.07.25, 3:29:14] ~ Shri Kanase: Is the upsell unclear to them or automatically added?
[8.07.25, 3:32:02] ~ Jeb: @⁨~Kyle Twohill⁩ this happened to me kind of. I went through and noticed how the ux/ design was a bit unclear or how someone could click it when trying to click out. Worth going through it ‎<This message was edited>
[8.07.25, 3:37:04] ~ Kyle Twohill: It’s really clear we have a big button that is like “Yes! Add this to my order”
[8.07.25, 3:37:33] ~ Kyle Twohill: Yeah there could be a decent amount of accidental clicks I’ll really dig through recordings
[8.07.25, 3:53:58] ~ Shri Kanase: I agree with above, dig through the recordings to see what the issue is
[8.07.25, 5:25:15] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone here buying engagement for ads? (Likes comments shares)
[8.07.25, 5:28:27] ~ Monaesh: Don’t your ads get engagement naturally?
[8.07.25, 5:40:53] ~ Mo: i have a gempage listicle then redirect to shopify PDP. i wanna see visitors recording when they land on pdp but I only see the recordings in the gempage , is there a way to see what happens in the product page in this case ? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.07.25, 8:23:23] ~ Ben Mansour: Download vitals
[8.07.25, 8:34:46] Topi: Microsoft clarity, good and free. You can install yourself 

Not sure whats the situation with vitals nowdays but when it came out it was super popular and soon abandoned by many people because it absolutely rekts your store speed and theme
[8.07.25, 8:50:19] ~ Mo: i have it but i only see recordings when they land on first page ( gempages) then i have no idea what happens on pdp
[8.07.25, 9:46:05] ~ Musawer: Anyone selling supplements? I want to know how much your average CPM is
[8.07.25, 10:07:25] Topi: Wonder if it’s installed right, never had these sort of issues
[8.07.25, 10:10:58] ~ Nico Neumann: If pdp is not gempages you might need to add the clarity code to the live store too, in case you haven’t done this. Probably not installed correctly, had the same issue
[8.07.25, 10:15:05] ~ Avriginski: We're planning to scale one of our products to another country. From a META pixel perspective, what's the best approach? Should we create a separate pixel for each country or keep using the same one we're already running with?
[8.07.25, 10:15:54] Topi: We always used same without issues
[8.07.25, 11:02:21] ~ Mo: When ab testing new pdp variant vs control. U split traffic 50/50 ?
Most of the time the variant is much worse that the control so it fucks up the whole perf when 50/50.
What percentage do u recommend guys ? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.07.25, 11:07:03] Topi: 30% for new variant

70% for current control

Switch 50/50 if results are promising
[8.07.25, 11:07:43] Topi: If you’re scaling hard and driving lot of traffic you can even do 20%
[8.07.25, 11:08:47] Topi: This way you minimize losses when you launch test that ends up losing which after a while of testing is most of your tests
[8.07.25, 11:11:48] ~ Mo: Yes definitely!
[8.07.25, 11:11:55] ~ Mo: Makes much sense thanks man

[8.07.25, 13:32:25] China Bigboss: Hey yes brother
[8.07.25, 14:10:16] ~ Gideon: Does anyone know if you can higher invoicing limit on meta? So you dont get an invoice for every 2000 you spend
[8.07.25, 14:24:28] ~ Matt: Hey guys I’m looking for an experienced 2-5min VSL editor in health and wellness space if anyone knows someone reliable to recommend?

[8.07.25, 16:26:05] ~ AK: Has meta been bit strict nowdays? just after 1-2 ads rejected ad accounts are getting disabled
[8.07.25, 16:29:39] ~ Guy Edan: Had the same experience last week. 2 rejected ads and account restricted
[8.07.25, 17:43:55] ~ alyas: Does anyone know Youtube channel sellers? 10k subs and approved for adsense

[8.07.25, 20:02:27] ~ Growg: Yeah, I can connect you with my replo developer. She is good at her work.
[8.07.25, 20:06:08] ~ Filippo: Yes pls
[8.07.25, 20:13:05] ~ Denis Mihin: Does anyone have a trusted supplier for gummy supplements with neccesary certificates for EU?

[9.07.25, 7:10:34] ~ Mike Ramsey: Hey All! 

For tomorrow’s payments call, I’ll be covering a 2 part series in partnership with Disputifier specifically around the new Visa Acquiring Monitoring Program (chargeback management program) and how not to get your payment processing account shut down or funds held.

I will also be providing a complimentary guide and checklist around the program and how to prepare as we are only a few months out from the new ‘stricter’ requirements set to roll out in October.

We’ll also cover the new chargeback thresholds/fines that will take place on October 1st and what the new TC40 additions will mean to your dispute ratio.  Very important to know how to manage this when you are scaling in Q4! 📈

See you there 👍

[10.07.25, 12:10:38] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Klaviyo is the hands down best tool for ecom email marketing. You can clean the list and only use engaged list to reduce the klaviyo bill. 

Happy to help you out. Hit me up
[10.07.25, 12:10:46] ~ AK: Pretty much every platfrom is same, you just need to have someone doing proper list cleaning so that you don’t overpay

Or you can tey sendlane which offers plan based on email sends, not based on how many profiles you have
[10.07.25, 12:12:24] ~ AK: Try this:

[10.07.25, 13:55:01] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Purely depends upon the results, and budget, Usually we test 30-50 ads per week for 500k+/mo brands

[10.07.25, 16:40:09] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Hit me up bro, Got a team who does everything for you from storyboarding, moodboarding, hiring models(any races and faces), shooting, editing. 

Basically, you send him the product and you’ll receive ready to publish creatives, they are comparatively affordable and professional
[10.07.25, 16:40:48] ~ Dawid: Does anyone here have a ai agency or knows someone , I have few questions
[10.07.25, 16:49:25] ~ Zainab: Based on your win rate, here’s how you calculate how many tests you need to hit your goal:

For example, if your win rate is 20% and your target ad spend on Facebook is $300K, and your average spend per winning ad is $10K, then:
	•	$300K / $10K = 30 winners needed
	•	With a 20% win rate, you need 5 tests to get 1 winner
	•	So, to get 30 winners: 30 × 5 = 150 tests

In short:
You need to test 150 ads to hit 30 winners, which allows you to deploy your full $300K budget.

[10.07.25, 19:26:31] ~ Riccardo Sonetti: Hi guys,
I'm currently using an agency ad account, but it just got disabled, probably due to the use of before/after images.

I wanted to ask: how do you avoid this kind of issue?
Are you also using agency ad accounts or do you have your own setup?

With most agency accounts, it’s not possible to connect your own credit card.
I saw someone mention Adrevival, but their pricing seems quite high.

Any tips or insights? 🙏
[10.07.25, 19:28:33] ~ Joel Cederlund: Im currently moveing slowly back to my ”personal” account. Got told incase of a exit it’s has more values than a agency account. Hope u solve your problem :)
[10.07.25, 19:29:17] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: ahh u can try asking out some agencies I remember some let u connect card if u offer them higher %, but wouldn't honestly recommend that bro
[10.07.25, 19:29:34] ~ Riccardo Sonetti: I’ve too my personal account but isn’t based on US, so maybe isn’t the best at the performance
[10.07.25, 19:57:40] ~ Avriginski: What’s your strategy as a media buyer when testing 30–50 ads per week on Meta? You drop each concept in a fresh CBO or throw ’em all in one Testing CBO with new ad sets?
[10.07.25, 20:19:12] ~ Bryan T: Anyone have an airwallex contact? My acc manager and their support are taking days to get back to me on a simple request
[10.07.25, 20:27:39] ~ Mike Ramsey: DM'd
[10.07.25, 20:52:57] ~ Manoj Bashyal: We always test the new variants manually, everything ABO, with Broad targeting mostly, but for some niche, interest stacked targeting still performs best during testing. 

You need to test what works the best for particular brand. 

After the winners are validated within 7 days, we scale them with ASC, CBO, leveraging all other winning elements. This is helping us scale sustainably. ‎<This message was edited>

[11.07.25, 5:05:40] ~ Lucas Alves: but dont know exactly how it works
[11.07.25, 5:14:13] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Try to implement the following elements:

1. Add trust badges near Add to Cart and checkout like SSL, secure payment, Money Back Guarantee etc.
2. Social proof pop-ups like “X just bought this” to build urgency and trust
3. Use a dedicated cart page with clear USPs (Free shipping, Easy returns, Product Guarantees etc.)
4. Add a checkout banner like 100% Secure, Free Shipping to reassure visitors 
5. Show final total early, no hidden fees. 
6. Enable Buy Now, Pay Later with Shop Pay, Klarna, etc.

[12.07.25, 19:45:31] ~ 🥇: Hi, we’ve started implementing funnels in Funnelish using Airwallex as our pg. However, we’re seeing a low acceptance rate in the U.S. market.
We’re looking for recommendations on alternative payment gateways that work well in the U.S.  ideally something we can apply for easily and that has high acceptance rates.
For context, we have a good track record with both Airwallex and Shopify Payments. Also, is there any way to integrate or use Shopify Checkout with Funnelish? We'd really appreciate any suggestions. Also If you have any insider for us pg you can connect us with

[13.07.25, 14:01:52] ~ RA: We use With Reach, they provide payment processing for each market you are selling in with local entities, this lowers fees and improves acceptance rates. They also provide PayPal, it never has holds since they have a good relationship with PayPal.

But you'll need to be approved by their team and go through some compliance checks.

But if is custom coded... shouldn't be too difficult because is another ATC with a discount applied.
[13.07.25, 17:11:16] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yeah, I used to work at Reach and there are some alternative MOR’s that offer Paypal.

Just depends on your integration / technical requirements.

Feel free to DM if you need options.
[13.07.25, 17:55:00] ~ Gustavo Drumm: How’s FB performance for you guys last couple days?

Nothing has changed on offer/landing page. But getting 5x more abandoned carts
[13.07.25, 18:38:50] ~ Monaesh: It’s prime day. Is your product available on Amazon?
[13.07.25, 18:38:56] ~ Manoj Bashyal: It’s likely not an ads issue, maybe it’s a CRO or your funnel problem.
How’s your retargeting and abandoned cart recovery?
[13.07.25, 18:41:24] ~ Gustavo Drumm: prime day on my main country was July 8-11
[13.07.25, 18:41:30] ~ Gustavo Drumm: and performance was great
[13.07.25, 18:44:22] ~ Gustavo Drumm: Conversions indeed are down, but again, nothing has changed on the funnel. I was getting around 10% abandoned. Last days is up to 40%
[13.07.25, 18:50:00] ~ Manoj Bashyal: If abandoned carts jumped from 10 to 40% without any changes, something is off. Ads can’t cause that huge difference alone. I’d audit the abandoned cart and checkout flow, site speed, and retargeting. Or sometimes there there could be cro or tech glitch too. 

Did you scale your ads aggressively?
[13.07.25, 19:00:45] ~ Gustavo Drumm: I don’t think is ad creative the problem. I had somedays thats that were like this, but then next day all back to normal. 

It’s a new product. Nothing aggressive. Barely 5k in sales this past week.

VSL metrics are good. CPMs are actually down. I suspect it may be targeting an unqualified audience
[13.07.25, 19:01:17] ~ Gustavo Drumm: will run new ads and see how it goes
[13.07.25, 19:20:47] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Your creative is the new targeting, Broad targeting works the best except you got super super niched products. 

Focus on combining your winners, creatives, products, offers, everything winners and scale with CBO, to maintain the cash flow with Roas positive. 

And Keep testing new stuffs consistently, so that you never run out of winners
[13.07.25, 19:27:56] ~ Gustavo Drumm: I’m running all on broad. No interests.

How would you set up this Winners CBO?

Each ad into a separate adset?
[13.07.25, 19:35:03] ~ Manoj Bashyal: We scale with multiple approaches:

1. CBO Scaling with Winners: 3 ad sets, 5 winning ads in each ad sets with $500 per day budget. 
2. ⁠CBO Scaling winners with cost per result goal: put $$ maintaining your ROAS Goal. 
3. Get creative with scaling: Calculate your risk tolerance capacity and scale for long term. Scale aggressively only when you have enough creatives, winning angles, and 3-4x+ ROAS
[13.07.25, 20:03:11] ~ Alexander Sundström: Do you guys have Shopify network intelligence on or off?
[13.07.25, 20:40:32] ~ Gustavo Drumm: Thanks, will give a try today
[13.07.25, 20:40:36] ~ Gustavo Drumm: The creative tests you run on ABO? 1 creative per adset?
[13.07.25, 20:53:24] ~ Manoj Bashyal: We do everything manual while testing for more precise data. 

ABO, 3-5 Creatives per ad set

Also Give flexible ads a try, while testing different hooks ‎<This message was edited>

[14.07.25, 9:25:01] ~ Musawer: Do you guys use engaged-view attribution?
[14.07.25, 12:03:27] ~ Matt: Quick win update for those who are doing CBO campaigns; split by static and video, we’ve seen much better results (20% reduction in CAC) by doing this as often statics would lose spend to more engaging videos if all in 1 campaign. This would increase the overall CAC as they served as BOF creatives . By splitting them, the best statics still get decent spend and boost overall peformance by not getting overtaken by videos. Worth testing
[14.07.25, 12:27:19] ~ Arthur: On what volume have you tested this?
[14.07.25, 12:35:13] ~ Matt: Yh to clarify this is with a new brand £600 per day spend but my media buyers are doing it for other brands at 10-20k+ per day too and seeing good results
[14.07.25, 12:42:13] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: Do you mean you have 2 cbo for each static and video, or separate video from static in terms of adset?
[14.07.25, 12:43:10] ~ Matt: 1 cbo for statics per product, 1 cbo for videos per product

Yesterday my conversion was at 1.01%. Today it's at 8.11%. I'm sure it'll drop throughout the day. The volume is not high. But still - Facebook is really fucking weird. 

I appreciate all the feedback. I'll implement the changes today and hopefully get better consistency with it. ‎<This message was edited>

[14.07.25, 18:53:12] ~ Brian: Shopify automatically compresses it for you with their CDN.

[14.07.25, 20:21:15] ~ Ben Mansour: Isn‘t that blackhat?
[14.07.25, 20:24:03] ~ Bryan T: What do you mean? All we have is a clear VIP offer on our product page and customers can cancel at any time. We also give them a 30 day free trial and spam them before they are charged.
[14.07.25, 20:26:09] ~ Ben Mansour: I know some stores have that in checkout below purchase button, automatically checked and small writing. Basically customers pay 30$ per months and get nothing
[14.07.25, 20:29:57] ~ Manoj Bashyal: From what I’ve seen across multiple brands running VIP or early access style offers, around 25-40% use it, depending on how exclusive and valuable the offer feels.

If the VIP list is just a glorified discount club, most people ignore it. But when there’s urgency, scarcity like limited drops, early access to sellouts, members only bundles, etc. redemption rates increases.

[14.07.25, 20:55:17] ~ P: Hello guys, To repeat a test after the page feedback score is too low, what is the procedure? Do I have to change the domain, Facebook page, creative, and after? The ad account and BM too? The Facebook profile that also runs the ads?
[14.07.25, 23:03:44] ~ YUSUF: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[14.07.25, 23:47:59] ~ Damiano: Hello guys, we currently test 3 batches of creatives per week, for a total of 30 creatives per week. To have more control we test them in abo with a budget of 30 euro per adset, within which 1/3 hook variations. After 150/200 euro spent, if it goes to Roas, I take the post id and bring it into a cbo 1 adset broad with all the creatives inside, still leaving the same creatives active in abo.

I realize that these creatives, once brought into CBO, do not receive spend because the CBO focuses on the previous creatives.

How can I improve this strategy to give more room for new creatives to scale?
[15.07.25, 0:02:29] ~ Phil: The pixel knows best so if it’s pushing spend towards the other creative then it thinks it’s better to push spend with that one
[15.07.25, 0:03:00] ~ Mai: I had this issue in the past, and what we did was to focus on customer support, product quality and shipping times to increase the score. usually in the next 1-2 cycles you should be good to go, it will recover over time
I would go to open a new Business only if you get restricted but it looks like it’s not the case. to avoid this issue, always provide the best shipping times / customer support and best overall experience.
[15.07.25, 0:12:38] ~ P: It's just because I scaled too high on  dropshipping because the stock was in preparation. But now the score is low because of this and the performance has dropped. I wish I could pull them back up. Now that I won't have any more stock  problems ‎<This message was edited>

[15.07.25, 6:23:04] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Go to the search filter inside your ads manager. 

Then search for deleted campaign. 

You can duplicate that and run it again.
[15.07.25, 6:25:45] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Your testing campaign structure is fine, but don’t rush for scaling. When you’re scaling with CBO, only use winning creatives after validitating them for at least 7-10 days with +3x roas. 

This way, you will use all the winners and meta will spend on the creatives that could be the winner of the winners during CBO.

[16.07.25, 21:06:40] ~ Joel Cederlund: Do u guys have fees on this?
Basically the agency i use I get Hongkong accounts but free from fees and they live of the cashback. Only problem locked to 5 domains + profiles
[16.07.25, 21:07:17] ~ A: I also normally do not pay fees, what are your fees?
[16.07.25, 21:07:50] ~ Jeremy Khattar: We dont use HK or Chinese accounts - they are lower tier ones
[16.07.25, 21:08:16] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Our business managers which are on the meta directory are USA and EU - we are going to be launching a membership no fees add your own cards
[16.07.25, 21:08:43] ~ Jeremy Khattar: We dont have cashback like HK and China (which will vanish before end of the year) but we can introduce you to our 3rd party providers that have 2.3% cashback on cards, like Slash @⁨~Shaan⁩
[16.07.25, 21:21:42] ~ A: Is there really a big perfomance difference between chinese ad accounts and other ones?
[16.07.25, 21:23:07] ~ Jeremy Khattar: i cannot pinpoint with accuracy but yes from what we’ve seen and the meta reps we work with, there is a difference in “tiers” of business managers between asia and the rest of the world
[16.07.25, 21:24:10] ~ Jeremy Khattar: if you are using chinese accounts and want to come test on your own, happy to give out a free month membership to the ESS crew
[16.07.25, 21:24:19] ~ Jeremy Khattar: that way we can base it on data
[16.07.25, 21:24:39] ~ Jeremy Khattar: we also have 0 restrictions on domains and pages which i know sometimes can be a pain
[16.07.25, 21:26:30] ~ A: What is your topup fee?
[16.07.25, 21:26:31] ~ Jeremy Khattar: One thing we did notice is cheaper CPMs between chinese, personal accounts and higher tier BMs like the ones we have - which reflects in the performance and costs
[16.07.25, 21:26:51] ~ Jeremy Khattar: if you are running clean ecom white hat we dont charge fees, only membership
[16.07.25, 21:27:38] ~ Jeremy Khattar: I will have a nice announcement for ESS group within 48 hours - but happy to sign up anyone that wants to jump the gun- im limiting the offer to 50 people as well to make sure we can treat everyone the same and give you guys a great experience

[16.07.25, 21:28:36] ~ A: Wait let me pm you it’s easier
[16.07.25, 21:29:34] ~ Jeremy Khattar: We are gonna be making 3 different tiers pricing, we dont have an exact number but it will be between 199 a month for lower spend all the way to 1999 a month for higher spenders - attach your cc, get your points or cashback, and that membership pays for itself at all levels
[16.07.25, 21:29:50] ~ Jeremy Khattar: we’re finalising the pricing to make sure everyone is getting the best deal in the industry for the highest tier accounts
[16.07.25, 21:34:35] ~ Jeremy Khattar: www.roninglobal.io
[16.07.25, 21:34:58] ~ Jeremy Khattar: for anyone that wants to learn more, ignore the pricing as that’s for leadgen and grey hat offers only - ecom will have no fees and different pricing by next week monday

[17.07.25, 1:00:50] ~ m: guys wts the recommended app to get people on recurring orders. got recharge on my old store and works great. installed it on my new store and the GUI is totally different now, it looks pretty bad imo, takes up way too much space, loads of T&Cs in small text. i think it will kill conversion rate and annoy customers so not going live with it.

wondering what others are doing nowadays for this? pls advise, thanks

[18.07.25, 19:39:09] ~ Mike Kasdorf: A PayPal account is nothing more than a payment processor and is tied to an EIN or similar identifier. You can't sell it.
[18.07.25, 19:45:19] ~ LC: Guys, genuine question would appreciate an answer. It's my first time in the supplement niche, everytime I get to 5-10k/days I get fucked by FB. I'm trying to be as compliant as possible, avoiding exaggerated claims, celebrities in ads, ect. I tried my own Ad Acc and 2 different agencies. Always banned, this is for 3 products aswell, which some of - my comp has been running for over 6 months with a shit ton of exaggerated claims ect and he has over 300+ active ads. Why is this? Is it FB insiders? Ad acc tier bs (I already used a 'Premium' one, if it was actually premium idk) - What can I do?

[18.07.25, 22:05:48] ~ Jonas Ma: Hey guys! Can anyone recommend a good currency conversion app for shopify?

We are using Airwallex payments not Shopify payments, is this even possible then to have the currency also converted in the checkout?
[18.07.25, 22:20:56] ~ Molka Sghaier: There is one thing that we tried and worked well for us when we had an aggressive brand , launch many statics that lead to an adv for a period of time then go back to crazy videos theyll let u run em , at first we used to get every single ad rejected after we did this nothing gets rejected.

Alao i have some friends running brands with insiders like every single ad gets back with insiders untill the acc gets a good amount of spend and then theyll leave u alone 


Meta favors accounts that spend well  and thats facts .
[18.07.25, 22:47:35] ~ Marlon Martinez: Somebody got contact for reddit post removal?

[19.07.25, 11:52:31] ~ Bazeed: what do you reckon was the reason in your case?
[19.07.25, 11:53:29] ~ LC: can't come down to anything specific, they just told me prod can't be advertised and it's not allowed on their 'ad accs' whilst other people have been running for over 6 months plus

[19.07.25, 14:05:54] Topi: If it’s a very new store you only need like 2x flows

- abandoned checkout 
- ⁠post purchase
- ⁠browse/cart abandonment (optional) 

Don’t waste time on any pop ups or welcome flows

Find the best direct response brands in your space + well established brands. Go to abandoned their stores and swipe their emails. Look for patterns how they convert.

Buy from 1-3 well established brands and model their post purchase
[19.07.25, 14:10:05] ~ Diletta: Nono is a brand that has already been active for months with a very strong product in front end and some upsells, but I would like to launch a new product leveraging my customer list with emails instead of just in front end
[19.07.25, 14:11:17] Topi: Oh damn my bad
[19.07.25, 14:11:30] Topi: Well at least someone launching a new store got their playbook ‎<This message was edited>
[19.07.25, 14:16:11] ~ m: launches are amazing i swear. doing it right now on a new brand we acquired and getting like 65-72% open rates. just make sure u have a good subject and preview text. if oyu do front end stuff im sure you know what good is classed as. and then email content. just use PAS framework. put an image of the product in there and 2-3 CTAs dotted around so its easy for the reader to find a CTA. i'd start there. design doesnt hv to be anything amazing, keep it simple. ‎<This message was edited>

[19.07.25, 16:05:41] ~ RS: Have you noticed FB ads performance different between Bestfulfill ad accounts and private ad accounts?
[19.07.25, 16:10:05] ~ Monaesh: Yes our CPM was 200% more on bestfulfill ad accounts
[19.07.25, 16:10:49] ~ Joel Cederlund: Idk heard different agency account perform different aswell
[19.07.25, 17:00:58] ~ Tariq: Just use a usa sim card + VPN
[19.07.25, 17:02:42] ~ K: What’s your normal CPM? I have around 40-50$ on bestfulfill
[19.07.25, 17:19:44] ~ Henry: hey guys, does anyone have contact for a person who can check claims in ads to make sure ad copy is compliant? We’re in health niche
[19.07.25, 17:22:45] ~ Mo: Gor it, For usa sim card where can i get it, amazon ? ( im not in the us)
[19.07.25, 17:25:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Ebay
[19.07.25, 17:32:13] ~ Jonny: Can anyone recommend agency for meta ad accounts that we can attach own CC?
[19.07.25, 17:47:49] ~ Bazeed: Anyone has experience with adrevival ad accounts here? they say 0% fee and pay with your own card
[19.07.25, 17:49:37] ~ Monaesh: Normal CPM on our own BM is 15 bucks but on bestfulfil it was 30-50
[19.07.25, 17:49:52] ~ Tariq: Look in ebay or fb marketplace
[19.07.25, 21:14:12] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Does anyone know if Klarna Inquiries count as disputes in the Stripe system or just if they expire and turn into disputes?
[20.07.25, 11:05:40] ~ Phil: Anyone have contact/contacts to create cheap listicles and advetorials??
[20.07.25, 11:12:54] ~ Manoj Bashyal: DM me
[20.07.25, 11:23:40] ~ Phil: And also the best quiz apps?
[20.07.25, 11:23:51] ~ Phil: Found 3 brands using the same one but can’t seem to find what it is
[20.07.25, 11:38:30] ~ Bazeed: interested in this too
[20.07.25, 11:39:12] ~ m: Yo guys if you want to sell a store you’re not doing anything with. Let me know. It’s gtta be cheap cheap tho. Dm me. Thanks
[20.07.25, 11:46:26] ~ UHO: You don’t get good things for “cheap”, you gotta be willing invest in good things bro. 😎
[20.07.25, 11:47:07] ~ Phil: Yeah of course!! But this product is barely proven so just testing at the moment. Don’t want to be spending too much right now

[20.07.25, 12:40:29] ~ Phil: Thank you
[20.07.25, 13:25:51] ~ michael: Heyflow is good
[20.07.25, 16:07:01] ~ Avriginski: I wouldn’t recommend using a VPN, you’ll get shadowbanned
[20.07.25, 16:07:19] ~ Avriginski: Get yourself an iPhone, factory reset it, set the region to the US, pop in a US SIM card, and create your account using a US number. Use hotspot from one of your own phones, don’t connect to your home WiFi

When you make the account, warm it up for 3–5 days. Don’t rush to post right away
[20.07.25, 16:09:57] ~ Mo: Thanks brother !!
[20.07.25, 16:56:38] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Ad revival
[20.07.25, 16:57:09] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: But they charge 2.5k$ pm for that plan so only worth it if you're spending over 100k$ per month bro
[20.07.25, 17:59:13] ~ Dawid: Do you guys know any website / someone who does product research for you that you can recommend ?

[20.07.25, 18:26:36] ~ Filippo: is Slash available for EU companies?
[21.07.25, 4:24:28] ~ Austin: What would you do if a copy writer won't perform a test trial? This has happened 4-5 times so far and It seems to be from the more experienced candidates, so I don't want to loose them, but at the same time it indicates their difficult to work with, does anyone have a suggestion here?
[21.07.25, 6:10:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Pay them for the test
[21.07.25, 6:23:49] ~ Bazeed: A talent comes with A price
[21.07.25, 6:23:52] ~ Bazeed: you pay them nicely
[21.07.25, 6:43:02] ~ Mo: anyone here managed to integrate Elevar with funnelish ?
[21.07.25, 7:33:29] ~ Steve: To be honest and I'm just speaking from 14 years of experience, asking an experienced copywriter to do a test (paid or unpaid) signals to them that you're the one that's hard to work with
[21.07.25, 7:34:51] ~ Steve: It's a major red flag, and most experienced writers can find higher paying clients who don't require that and can make a decision based on their portfolio of work.

Clients who want to "test drive you" first, signal they're inexperienced and it's just better to not bother
[21.07.25, 7:37:47] ~ Steve: Everytime I've agreed to a test I've regretted it. Not because of the test but because every time, without fail, those clients give you unreasonable deadlines, bug you constantly for work, try to pay you below what you're worth, and drag their feet on payment too.
[21.07.25, 7:39:26] ~ Steve: Business owners who wanna pay you $2k for work always want to test.

Business owners who are able to pay you $20k for work never ask for a test.
[21.07.25, 8:55:20] ~ Yente Dhooge: How do you think about this for other positions like Creative strategist, video editor, ... ?
[21.07.25, 9:06:40] ~ Steve: Video Editors can be tested, because they're easy to find.

Strategists depends. I feel different people consider creative strategist different things.

I've always thought of that role as a creative director - overseeing everything from VSLs to pages to branding etc and how it all comes together. In this regard, that's someone I want to spend time making sure is the right person that is on the team for a long time.

But I realize a lot of people view that strategist role differently. So I wouldn't really be looking to "test" them as much as I would have a 60 day window in which, if they're not performing or are not a fit, I'd fire them fast
[21.07.25, 9:07:01] ~ Steve: Hire slow, fire fast - continues to be a good strategy time and time again
[21.07.25, 9:23:33] ~ Mo: for new meta ad accounts, do u still warm them up or launch conversions right away ?
[21.07.25, 11:38:06] ~ Kain: anyone using Pinterest and Triplewhale ?
[21.07.25, 11:42:35] ~ UHO: If you trust their expertise, why do you need a test? Just curious. It’s a red flag to experienced, non-desperate-for-your-money kinda copywriter.
[21.07.25, 11:43:27] ~ UHO: True.
[21.07.25, 11:44:51] ~ Timotej: Yo guys, looking for a video editor with experience in long-form VSL funnels. 

Need someone who:

- Can create curiosity without talking about the product in the video ad - goal is to sell the long VSL after the click.

Can be full-time and/or time-time.
[21.07.25, 12:42:24] ~ Omar Tayara: het guys is anyone using n8n to automate the ad flipping system with ai? not sure if i should hire more copywriters and editors or just create a workflow with ai
[21.07.25, 13:06:29] ~ dtjon: anybody in dubai right now that's down to go play some padel?
[21.07.25, 13:10:28] ~ Molka Sghaier: Yaaaas 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
[21.07.25, 13:33:31] ~ Giuliano: does someone know a good app for a discount - code Bar where people can apply the code in the ATC slidepage ? thx!
[21.07.25, 13:47:35] ~ Cocow😈: Now promo code in the ATC is native to shopify, no need an app. SO probably working with a dev can solde you this without adding apps 🙂
[21.07.25, 13:48:43] ~ Omar Tayara: Use upcart
[21.07.25, 13:58:36] ~ Giuliano: Thx guys ❤️🙏🏻
[21.07.25, 15:22:16] ~ P: hello, a great agency to manage the email and sms marketing?
[21.07.25, 15:37:47] ~ Manoj Bashyal: DM me brother, I got a full stack marketing agency
[21.07.25, 15:42:31] ~ Matt: I have a great one for $2000 a month
[21.07.25, 15:42:36] ~ Matt: Russian team
[21.07.25, 15:45:48] ~ Nicolò: someone have a great agency for ig post and organic content?
[21.07.25, 15:53:33] ~ m: Cheap. Drop me details too pls
[21.07.25, 15:55:18] ~ P: how much % of revenue from them?
[21.07.25, 15:55:36] ~ P: I don't want to pay too little..I want to have excellent service
[21.07.25, 16:12:35] ~ Matt: Nothing just a flat fee for 2 campaigns a week
[21.07.25, 16:12:54] ~ Matt: It is the best agency I’ve used and I’ve used ones that are $5k a month for my brands
[21.07.25, 16:13:20] ~ Matt: Includes all flow optimisations etc
[21.07.25, 16:13:27] ~ P: no I mean their results, What % of revenue can they generate?
[21.07.25, 16:17:39] ~ marek bednar: ‎This message was deleted.
[21.07.25, 17:33:44] ~ AK: you just sending 2 campaigns per week?
[21.07.25, 17:36:47] ~ Matt: For larger brand i do 3 campaigns and newer one is 2 per week
[21.07.25, 17:37:06] ~ M: i thought usually its 3-4 week recommended
[21.07.25, 17:37:14] ~ Matt: It varies by brand but around 30%
[21.07.25, 17:37:44] ~ Matt: It varies by brand, you could do daily if you wanted in fashion but other niches can be a negative
[21.07.25, 17:38:35] ~ Simeon Petrov: Do they show the welcome flow coupon code on the success page of the pop-up or just in the welcome flow?
[21.07.25, 17:38:49] ~ M: for us its been been becasue apparently thats the sweet spot as too little emails less then 3 they forget about the brand and actually unsubscribe more, more then 4 they get annoyed
[21.07.25, 17:38:54] ~ M: saw a video somewhere about it too
[21.07.25, 17:39:01] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Btw, we send around 20-25 email campaigns per month, by creating a segment, so that we are not hurting the email deliverability and domain health. 

If you send emails daily to the same list, you’re setting your emails up to go into spam.
[21.07.25, 17:39:35] ~ M: yh daily would cook your deliverability
[21.07.25, 17:41:26] ~ Manoj Bashyal: I recommend to create the segment based on the customer journey and their awareness level, and send them the personalized campaigns with multiple angles and offers, this helps to balance the overall revenue with higher conversion rates.
[21.07.25, 17:42:53] ~ Matt: Yh it all needs to be tested basically, we used to send daily emails segmented but it actually performed worse then limiting to 3
[21.07.25, 17:43:07] ~ Matt: Everything needs to be tested to find what works for your brand
[21.07.25, 17:43:36] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Can you share the attribution window you guys use for email marketing?
[21.07.25, 17:43:48] ~ Matt: We found that offering a ‘surprise’ discount results in double the sign ups for example - there isn’t a surprise it’s the same discount that is already on the pdp if they buy 2 or more
[21.07.25, 17:44:10] ~ Matt: So we saved 10% discount margin just by doing that and increased sales considerably
[21.07.25, 17:44:25] ~ M: whats your guys pop up sign up rate
[21.07.25, 17:44:44] ~ AK: for attribution window usually 5 day is good on klaviyo, but usually klaivyo tracking is shit so you should use triplewhale or other platfroms for better accurate tracking
[21.07.25, 17:46:41] ~ Alvaro De Prada: 5 day Opened email and Clicked email? 

Or only Clicked email?
[21.07.25, 17:47:02] ~ AK: both opened and clicked
[21.07.25, 17:47:53] ~ M: btw if you have issue swith the tracking with klaviyo try aimerce or Kluvos
[21.07.25, 17:47:57] ~ AK: usually like 8-10% but it depends on how much time delay you have for popup as well
[21.07.25, 17:48:53] ~ AK: is it accurate compared to klaviyo? because usually klaviyo shows lot more revenue than what’s actually coming from email
[21.07.25, 17:49:20] ~ M: nah mainly for tracking the add to carts and checkouts etc that kalviyo tends to miss
[21.07.25, 17:49:33] ~ M: seen email flow revenue go up like 10% with it
[21.07.25, 17:50:07] ~ AK: you using triplewhale for tracking revenue?
‎[21.07.25, 17:50:33] ~ Alvaro De Prada: ‎image omitted
[21.07.25, 17:51:01] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you attribute as Opened email.... attributed revenue spikes
[21.07.25, 17:51:50] ~ AK: yes usually that’s the case for flows, because lot of people form flows might already have the website opened in browser, so they just open email for discount code and don’t actually click button
[21.07.25, 17:51:59] ~ AK: mainly for welcome series
[21.07.25, 17:52:51] ~ AK: but ya klaviyo is still not really accurate, i guess only way to track the revenue properly is with external tracking software like triplewhale
‎[21.07.25, 17:53:17] ~ Alvaro De Prada: ‎image omitted
[21.07.25, 17:55:18] ~ AK: ya big difference
[21.07.25, 17:55:30] ~ AK: i usually just look at triplewhale
[21.07.25, 17:55:45] ~ AK: usually ones shown on klaviyo is 30-40% more than one on triplewhale
[21.07.25, 17:56:05] ~ Alvaro De Prada: triplewhale sort of matches the 5 day click no open email
[21.07.25, 17:56:27] ~ AK: ya i believe triplewhale is lot more accurate that klaviyo
[21.07.25, 17:56:43] ~ AK: klaviyo always has issue showing more revenue than what’s actually coming
[21.07.25, 17:57:00] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I was paying a % of Klaviyo revenue to an agency. As soon as I fixed the tracking... their payout decreased by A LOT
[21.07.25, 17:57:44] ~ AK: ya for mine i just pay them looking at triplewhale revenue
[21.07.25, 17:57:57] ~ AK: and have discussed certain max cap with them
[21.07.25, 17:58:13] ~ Manoj Bashyal: triple whale is far more accurate than klaviyo metrics when you set up the UTM Tracking properly
[21.07.25, 18:00:17] ~ AK: anyone here doing snapchat ads?
[21.07.25, 18:00:41] ~ Manoj Bashyal: yessir, we are doing it
[21.07.25, 18:01:11] ~ AK: is snapchat lost more strict than meta and tikok for creatives?
[21.07.25, 18:01:28] ~ AK: almost all creatives I launched got rejected, same creatives are running fine on meta and tikokt
[21.07.25, 18:01:35] ~ AK: or maybe because it’s new account?
[21.07.25, 18:02:14] ~ Manoj Bashyal: what’s your niche? I find it more strict for certain niches and keywords.
[21.07.25, 18:06:17] ~ AK: Beauty
[21.07.25, 18:06:57] ~ AK: Ya for other store its working fine
[21.07.25, 18:08:16] ~ Manoj Bashyal: if there’s huge or unrealistic claims, that go against snapchat policy, remove those claims and keywords, that will help
[21.07.25, 18:08:31] ~ Manoj Bashyal: it’s not soley because it’s new account
[21.07.25, 18:12:09] ~ AK: ok thanks for info
[21.07.25, 19:26:23] ~ Jose Miguel Lepage: Hey! Does anybody know about a course/program for AI prompting you can recommend?

[22.07.25, 17:51:17] ~ OB: Forget about it you have to be US citizen
[22.07.25, 17:51:51] ~ Denis Mihin: Not true, just need an ITIN
[22.07.25, 17:54:58] ~ Mike Ramsey: That’s correct - just need ITIN and also helpful to have proof of ‘physical business office’ and personal residence.  You can use a friend or relative in most cases.
[22.07.25, 17:57:06] ~ AK: Anyone else had Shopify disable Payments and hold all funds with 0 chargebacks?

Happening to me on multiple new stores too. No chargebacks at all. Anyone know why or how to fix it?

[22.07.25, 17:58:28] ~ Kostić: probably some policy violation, message them
[22.07.25, 17:59:19] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yeah you should list business AND personal address.  2 separate addresses ideally.  If you list business as both, then it can cause problems.

[22.07.25, 21:00:16] ~ Christopher Murphy: Happens on a lot of the new offers I run
[22.07.25, 21:11:48] ~ Tariq: if on the same ad account and same creatives you have better metrics, just keep it running for a couple of days and it'll get better
[22.07.25, 21:12:37] ~ Christopher Murphy: Relatively new ad account. Would agency accounts solve this?
[22.07.25, 21:13:04] ~ Tariq: are you running same creatives and you see better results in other ad accounts?
[22.07.25, 21:19:13] ~ Christopher Murphy: Tested under a different owned BM and cpms were similar. Getting setup with agency accounts now. I’m trying to figure out if it’s an ad account level issue
[22.07.25, 21:25:20] ~ Nico: 100% try at least 4-5 different ad account agency i always see difference

I have a brand in the bedding niche and now we are expanding the catalog with mattresses pillowcases and etc... I would like to understand from a pixel perspective, farmed with over 5,000 pillow purchases, what can I do to test other creative on other products in our niche? Can it stay that way and learn, or is there any particular action to be taken? I would appreciate any feedback, thank you! ‎<This message was edited>
[23.07.25, 0:09:46] ~ Filippo: Doubt you need a new pixel
[23.07.25, 0:59:40] ~ Anatoly: Your existing pixel will learn and optimise for new SKUs whille continue learning about your best seller. Basically, do not be concerned you will confuse it with new data, as it treats each lander, price point and product separately.

[23.07.25, 11:26:35] ~ Manoj Bashyal: You can use the value rule on your campaign where you can set up the bid to spend more on your target demographics.
[23.07.25, 11:34:21] ~ Nicolò: this is possibile only if my campaign is optimize in Purchase Value right?
[23.07.25, 12:01:46] ~ Cocow😈: Hello guys, quick Meta Ads question. 

Now the adsets are by default with AA+ (Advantage + on ). Before, we were launching our ads on broad so we we needed to click and accept to go in the previous way back then 2020 haha. 

Is now Broad totally gone and only AA+ works ? 

Thank you very much 🙂

[23.07.25, 12:45:11] ~ Manoj Bashyal: By using the value rule method,

You are letting meta spend to your right audience segment.

Calculate your LTV and see which segment (gender, age, location, operating system) gives you the most ROI, you can let meta spend 80% of the budget to this segment.

I would be very grateful to anyone who wants to discuss this in dm! 🙏🏻
[25.07.25, 22:02:45] ~ Tony: Stay 183 days in a country become tax resident

Get TRC get a life there.

Don’t fuck with the EU 😂

Just move and don’t stay longer then 3 months in 1 country

[25.07.25, 22:13:54] ~ Diletta: Yes but my question is: sometimes prices for airbnb for long stays are crazy compared to long term rents. What's the trick?
[25.07.25, 22:15:54] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Get your residence in Malta which is close to italy. If you want Malta to “defend” you against italy you need to live there for 183+ days (not need to be consecutive). If Italy asks where you are paying taxes, you want a country to give you the tax resident certificate so you can show to italy that you are resident elsewhere.

If you become 100% nomad with no actual residency… is not super good for italy, because you can’t actually defend yourself and show proof
[25.07.25, 22:28:17] ~ LC: If you need help/info to get your residence in Malta lmk I’m from there.

[26.07.25, 1:39:56] ~ Mike Ramsey: I can - DM
[26.07.25, 1:53:25] ~ Manuel Fernandez: Move to Dubai, rent a yearly apartment. Stay here at least 90 days every year. Get TRC, and when you are outside Dubai you just rent your apparmenf to somebody else to pay the rent and bills
[26.07.25, 3:01:05] ~ Michael: I'm German but for us paypal
[26.07.25, 3:02:49] ~ Damiano: Hello, do you know someone for Spain?
[26.07.25, 10:13:48] ~ Yente Dhooge: You can text the owner through the listing & get a custom offer. Many times airbnb hosts agreed on this already. Definately for longer stays - some are open for negotiation
[26.07.25, 10:37:53] ~ Musawer: for those who use Funnelish, did you guys enable the express checkout for Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc?
[26.07.25, 10:49:19] ~ Diletta: Thank you so much!
[26.07.25, 10:49:29] ~ Diletta: Interesting! Thank you!
[26.07.25, 11:26:01] ~ HLR: I am on the fence about testing Funnelish. I currently use Shopify for all funnels, but interested in seeing if I can get a higher converting funnel.

[26.07.25, 12:31:58] ~ Tony: It does. 

Study the Eu Laws before you brag some advice that fucks people up
[26.07.25, 12:32:32] ~ Tony: Ask a European tax lawyer and not a Dubai, they don’t know anything about Europe
‎[26.07.25, 12:38:51] ~ Alvaro De Prada: ‎image omitted
[26.07.25, 12:44:56] ~ Tony: I would say do it.

Just stay in your home country 4 months and if you get a control.

You will be a blessed men.
[26.07.25, 12:45:44] ~ Tony: Do your research, 

It’s compliance / laws.
[26.07.25, 12:46:28] ~ Tony: Invest some money in a tax Laywer and you’ll see how Europe thinks and what they don’t like and what they see as permanent r residency

[26.07.25, 13:15:28] ~ Phil: Maybe bump it back down to $600 see if it stabilises again. Once ROAS picks back up try scaling back to $700
[26.07.25, 13:49:11] ~ Nils: If I were you, I would probably try to create some more ads to find more winning creative because you definitely have something here.
[26.07.25, 13:49:46] ~ Nils: Personally, I'm more of a fan of testing creatives with ABOS and then scaling with other types of campaigns (not just increasing budget internally).
[26.07.25, 13:50:09] ~ Nils: However, focus on creative and offer the ad structure probably doesn't actually do too much in my opinion.
[26.07.25, 13:54:48] ~ Rick: Has your frequency gone up a lot?
‎[26.07.25, 13:58:35] ~ dtjon: ‎image omitted
[26.07.25, 14:28:01] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Don’t scale vertically on your active campaigns, the ROAS usually drops nowadays when you scale the budget on your existing campaign. If you wanna scale agressively, scale horizontally with new creatives or winning creatives.
[26.07.25, 14:49:53] ~ Matt: It’s probably your old creative wasn’t good enough to scale spend higher so you need to keep making more to find creative that can accommodate higher spend levels.

Also if you’re profitable I would keep budget the same and pump more creative alongside LP tests to see if it bumps CR back up.
[26.07.25, 16:21:39] ~ AA: Hi guys, I’m driving traffic from ads to an advertorial and then to the product page on Shopify, but I’m having trouble tracking sessions properly. Specifically, I can’t figure out the cvr of the advertorial, which makes it hard to optimize. Does anyone know a better way to track this?
[26.07.25, 16:38:19] ~ Manoj Bashyal: hit me up, happy to help 🙂
[26.07.25, 21:53:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Can anyone recommend killer creative agencies?
‎[26.07.25, 21:54:20] ~ Manoj Bashyal: ‎Contact card omitted
[26.07.25, 21:54:26] ~ Manoj Bashyal: reach out to him, best in the game
[27.07.25, 3:10:24] ~ Shri Kanase: Anyone know any solid CRO freelancers for eCommerce brands?
[27.07.25, 7:58:01] ~ Manoj Bashyal: We are an agency but offer a good price
[27.07.25, 8:57:40] ~ Mithiran: The $100 increase in spend isn’t that much. so it could be coincidence that the ROAS dropped. 

With our winning ads they usually have an abnormally high ROAS (2.5-3)  for the first 2 weeks, then they decrease to about 1.7-1.8 and stay constant

But every ad account is different so I’m not 100% sure if it applies to you
[27.07.25, 8:59:00] ~ Mithiran: In this case what I would do is keep adding more creatives.

Usually for us winning creatives can 2-3x spend of a campaign with high ROAS
[27.07.25, 9:04:59] ~ Ry: What do u do when those “winning creatives” with like above 1k tested spend don’t get spending when you add them to scaling cbo campaigns?
[27.07.25, 9:08:33] ~ Mithiran: I have 3-4 CBOs so if an ad has low spend high ROAS. I’ll move it to another CBO. If it still doesn’t spend ill create a new campaign with just that ad
[27.07.25, 9:09:21] ~ Mithiran: We don’t do testing campaigns
[27.07.25, 9:18:29] ~ Ry: And if low spend no sale u just leave it?
[27.07.25, 9:23:19] ~ Mithiran: Usually our ads at least spend enough to know if it’s bad. But if there’s a specific ad I want to get an important learning out of I will move it into new campaign even if no sales
[27.07.25, 9:34:25] ~ Musawer: Hi guys, im using funnelish and im selling on UK, IE, AU, but some of our customer attempting purchase but they cant buy, i reach out to one of them, they say it not accepting the credit card and they used visa, mastercard...

Anyone experienced this problem before? And how can i solve it. İm using stripe

Also do i need to turn on the express checkout?
[27.07.25, 9:41:35] ~ P: interesting...me too same situation

[27.07.25, 9:42:25] ~ P: maybe something has changed
[27.07.25, 9:45:29] ~ Ry: It happened to me 2 weeks ago. Try test your checkout. Error for some reason and had to reconnect the payment gateway.
[27.07.25, 9:54:16] ~ P: And you solved?
[27.07.25, 9:55:21] ~ P: Definitely after a while stripe should be taken off which is really the most basic
[27.07.25, 9:55:33] ~ Ry: Yes. After reconnecting payment gateway. Check if you encounter error first by making a purchase
[27.07.25, 9:55:47] ~ P: But paypal also went down so it is strange
[27.07.25, 9:56:36] ~ P: What are your %? So we can compare. Maybe in the last 30 days
[27.07.25, 9:57:24] ~ Ry: Success rate is like 2% when i had the issue. Now is 90%
[27.07.25, 9:58:49] ~ P: Ah ok so it's not exactly my situation
[27.07.25, 10:01:13] ~ Ry: Oh i think ur last 30 days is fine. It normal fluctuations to me. For paypal even if they abandon halfway at paypal its considered payment failure
[27.07.25, 10:04:14] ~ P: Maybe so. Difficult to understand..the only way is comparing with other
[27.07.25, 10:27:31] ~ Mithiran: has anyone tested turning off paypal as checkout option? Does CVR decrease
[27.07.25, 10:43:56] ~ P: It is very likely to decrease. But it depends on the market. In Germany, I don't think you stand without PayPal

[29.07.25, 11:22:55] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, anyone here that can tell me the pros and cons about one click upsell and aftersell? Which one works the best for post-purchases?
[29.07.25, 12:54:58] ~ Matt: I have a good one if you need an intro
[29.07.25, 13:03:33] ~ Musawer: Anyone know how to solve stripe blockingand declining  50% customers payment?
[29.07.25, 15:10:39] ~ Mithiran: hey guys what is the best countries to hire creative strategists
[29.07.25, 15:37:02] ~ Alexander Sundström: What do you pay a junior manager (that manages web development, video editors, system building) fulltime? The person has experience from running their own brands, but wants to learn more.
[29.07.25, 15:44:54] ~ UHO: Sounds like a lot of value from one person, ask him what his salary expectation is, and pay it with a little extra if you can afford to. There is never a one-size-fits-all in things like this because our businesses don't make the same.
[29.07.25, 15:49:47] ~ Alexander Sundström: This person is suppose to free up more time for me. Like you said, it is valuable. Right out the gate, what would this be worth to you? I’m thinking that if this person delivers and help us grow there is no doubt that I would want to pay the person well. ‎<This message was edited>
[29.07.25, 15:52:47] ~ UHO: I hear you, there are several factors to consider, but given the size of my establishment and what we currently make, off the top of my head, I'll say $2k-$5k per month.
[29.07.25, 15:53:35] ~ Alexander Sundström: Thanks! I thought he came in a little hot. He wanted 7,5k
[29.07.25, 15:54:08] ~ UHO: If you can justify it and afford to pay it, you should.
[29.07.25, 15:54:34] ~ UHO: But nothing is non negotiable.
[29.07.25, 15:55:01] ~ Alexander Sundström: I appreciate it! Thank you

[30.07.25, 5:00:58] ~ Rashid Samhan: Greetings from Bali! 🌴
We’ve touched down on this beautiful land — part work, part inspiration, and fully about building connections. If you’re also here, let’s turn this paradise into a networking opportunity.

Coffee by the beach? Sunset talk on scaling brands? Quick exchange of ideas that could spark the next big move?

Drop a message if you’re in Bali — let’s make something meaningful happen while we’re here.
[30.07.25, 8:09:09] ~ Davide: I use dondy for that
[30.07.25, 8:37:49] ~ Musawer: Does anyone use Funnelish, clickfunnel or checkoutchamp and doing the checkout on Shopify?
[30.07.25, 9:35:00] ~ Max: Hii does anyone know a S2S/conversions API expert with Meta experience??
[30.07.25, 10:53:09] ~ Matt: Does anyone have a good guide on how to calculate 90 day LTV if you have different supply variants I.e. 1 month supply, 2 month supply and 3 month supply? And then how to blend these to get an average you can use in a forecast model
[30.07.25, 11:10:33] ~ Manoj Bashyal: yes we do, hit me up
[30.07.25, 11:56:50] ~ m: Thanks man
[30.07.25, 12:24:58] ~ Jonny: Hi guys, my VA is looking for some extra work. She's worked with me for 7+ years in ecommerce, extremely competent and a real A-Player when it comes to customer service/VA/supplier comms. If anyone needs some extra hands, drop me a message. Just trying to help her out
[30.07.25, 16:46:46] ~ Adonis A: Has anyone here experienced a Gmail hack leading to campaigns being launched in your ad acct by hackers? Luckily the campaign they launched didn’t spend but now our original campaigns aren’t spending either so sales are way down
[30.07.25, 16:48:10] ~ Nikola Petkov: I have yeah
[30.07.25, 16:48:59] ~ Adonis A: Bro, How long till your ads started spending again . On our other ad acct the original campaigns weren’t affected but on this one nothing is spending
[30.07.25, 16:53:13] ~ Nikola Petkov: What did they do, they put some random ads in the campaigns or what. I didn't experience this issue. They made a new campaign in my ad acc, made it seem like it's ours but the budgets were max + were selling some indian shit. ‎<This message was edited>
[30.07.25, 16:54:03] ~ Nikola Petkov: I just stopped them after some spend, changed the passwords and logged them out. Relaunched the main campaigns at 00:00 and everything was fine.
[30.07.25, 17:14:50] ~ Num: hey guys anyone using madgicx for facebook ads ?
[30.07.25, 17:48:07] ~ UHO: This has happened to us before. We killed the bad campaigns, changed all passwords, logged out every session, then relaunched our main campaigns fresh at 00:00. In some cases we duplicated them for a clean start. When spend was still stuck, we ran a small high-bid warm-up to kick delivery back in, then switched back to normal scaling.
[30.07.25, 18:30:56] ~ Adonis A: Ok thanks guys
[30.07.25, 18:57:01] ~ RS: Has anyone tested new pixel after months of poor meta ads performance? And do you think it can hurt performance if you see some strange bot traffic coming in every day multiple times a day?
[30.07.25, 19:13:41] ~ Tony: Then your creative sucks 😂
[30.07.25, 19:16:18] ~ RS: Dont believe that anymore after testing 500+ creatives over past few months and still CPMs are close to 200$ past 4 months. Before that cpm was up to 100$
[30.07.25, 19:18:05] ~ Tony: 1. New ad account
2. ⁠new pixel
3. ⁠new page
4. Domain could be flagged ‎<This message was edited>
[30.07.25, 19:19:56] ~ RS: Yeah i bought some FB insider checks and it showed some penalties on ad acc and page but not sure if it can hurt performance so bad. Tried different page that was created year ago but almost not used - on old ad acc ther was 170$ cpm, on new ad acc 270$ cpm with the same new page 😀

For domain there were no flags
[30.07.25, 19:20:21] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: do u think testing new agencies and BMs too?
[30.07.25, 19:20:44] ~ Tony: I would always prefer own ad account
[30.07.25, 19:20:46] ~ RS: I tested agency bms, personal bms and ad accs, nothing changed ‎<This message was edited>
[30.07.25, 19:20:51] ~ Tony: Some agencies work some agencies are shit
[30.07.25, 19:21:05] ~ RS: Currently work with Bestfulfill
[30.07.25, 19:21:28] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: im profitable and a new store, i did all these the cpms never go below 150$. i haven't done a lot of testing tho. its not so competitive niche, i have ran before it was like 50$ cpms.
[30.07.25, 19:21:30] ~ Tony: I would recommend try different domain
[30.07.25, 19:21:59] ~ Marcos García: I've contact for Httpool Accounts if you're interested
[30.07.25, 19:22:30] ~ RS: But for the past months i see some random bot traffic coming every day from domain referers like kiroth.shop , busbianh.shop and many other non existing websites. I thought maybe this bot traffic is fcking up my optimization over time
[30.07.25, 19:45:13] ~ Fabian: Yes they spent 1k$ on my account then FB banned the account
[30.07.25, 19:45:46] ~ Fabian: 1-2 years ago
[30.07.25, 20:41:41] ~ Musawer: Where do you find the fb insider

[31.07.25, 0:19:16] ~ Filippo: Forwarding:

FYI new Meta rollout:
Starting August 5th and with 8-week roll out, user feedback collected by Meta post-purchase (Formerly ACE - after conversion engagement) will start to directly affect CPMs for all advertisers. 
The score is at an ad account level, not a business level. The shortest period of correcting is a month, but likely longer in most cases.
[31.07.25, 2:50:22] ~ Kostić: source?
[31.07.25, 2:50:44] ~ Kostić: Its probably been like that already

[31.07.25, 7:57:53] Fabian: If you want to figure out what are good apps or similar, 

best thing for me is to go to websites/funnels you like, 
(if you don’t know any, do more research through gethookd for example)

Then go to inspect the elements you like, upsells, quiz funnels, bundles often have some indicator of it’s backend. If not, you can likely conclude it’s custom built.
Aside from that, view page source (next to inspect) will sometimes also tell you stuff (use cmd f)
[31.07.25, 10:30:44] ~ Mo: 100% bro ! Thank you 🙏🏽
[31.07.25, 10:31:53] ~ Mo: Anyone ever worked with real doctors/authority figures to endorse ur products ? hows the process looks like ?

[31.07.25, 12:52:34] ~ Dominik Olszewski: Hello! Does anyone have a good SOP or best practices for managing and engaging brand ambassadors on a month to month basis to keep them active and motivated?
[31.07.25, 13:04:56] ~ RS: Is anyone here saw bot traffic coming in their funnels? I have thousands of bot traffic every day and need a solution for my pixel to not fire pageview events for this bot traffic. Or maybe there are some good options to block bot traffic before it reaches my website?
[31.07.25, 16:07:23] ~ P: Do you know how to bypass Claude's restriction on medical devices, ethics, etc.?

[31.07.25, 19:45:56] ~ Mai: guy you should use Gemini, much better results
[31.07.25, 20:00:46] ~ Tony: Do you need a ITIN for US Shopfiy Payments? or EIN is enough?
[31.07.25, 20:01:11] ~ Mai: Ein is enough
[31.07.25, 20:02:05] ~ Tony: I am swapping my store under a new enetity and It is asking for ITIN 😮
[31.07.25, 20:02:14] ~ Tony: But I've got a dummy store verified with EIN.
[31.07.25, 20:09:31] ~ Davide: Also for scriptwriting?
[31.07.25, 20:12:26] ~ Filippo: Started to use Gemini for research and Claude for copy
[31.07.25, 20:16:06] ~ Davide: from an email of alex cooper:

The 4 Elements of Every Great Prompt
Here are the 4 core elements that I try to work into the majority of my prompts:
Identity + Task + Context + Output
Identity
This is about telling the AI who it should be.
E.g. “You are a seasoned direct response copywriter trained to extract winning Facebook ad headlines directly from customer reviews. You write like the best performance marketers in the world — people like David Ogilvy, Dave Gerhardt, and Harmon Brothers.”
Task
Clearly define exactly what you want the model to do.
E.g. “Your job is to analyze the customer reviews I provide and select the ones that are most suitable for static Facebook ad headlines. Then, rank these review snippets by how confident you are that each could work as a headline for a prospect who has never heard of our brand. Prioritize relevance, specificity, and emotional clarity over generic praise or brand loyalty.”
Context
Give the AI both good and bad examples, and explain WHY they're good or bad (this is arguably the most important part).
E.g. “A good example:
“The only shampoo that ended my dandruff battle”
— Clear pain point, outcome-driven, universally relatable
A bad example:
“I’m super picky, and these guys hit it out of the park from A to Z.”
— Too vague, not specific to any particular pain point or audience”
Output Structure
Tell the AI EXACTLY how you want the response formatted for a more accurate output:
E.g. “A ranked list of 5–10 customer quotes (best to worst), with each quote labeled A, B, C, etc.
Under each quote, add a short justification: explain why this one is strong/weak for cold audiences.
Then, group them into tiers:
Tier 1 = Highly usable as-is
Tier 2 = Might need light editing
Tier 3 = Too vague”
So altogether, once we’ve added a little more meat to this prompt here’s what it looks like:

Here’s a prompt I made using the 4- element prompt structure
A few prompting hacks…
Here are some other lines I like to add to my prompts to help me improve the outputs:
Rate each output from 1-10 and only show me 8+ quality
Once you’re happy with your final output, ask "What would I have had to ask to get this exact output?" (reverse engineer your wins)
For each output, tell it that it was a 4/10, and you need a 10/10 - impress me
Raise the stakes by adding "if this does not [INSERT GOAL], I will get fired. It is that important"
Ask “Now rewrite this as if it's version 10 after 9 rounds of expert feedback”
At the end of your initial prompt, add in this sentence: “Before you give your response, what questions do you have that would help you give a better response?”
For each output, ask, “How could you improve that?” Keep asking this question over and over
Tell it to act as an expert. E.g. "Act as a world class direct response copywriter" or "write like you're being paid $1,000,000 to do this"
Raising the stakes has been proven to improve the outputs that AI gives you. Hence why I end up using these all the time haha.
Build Your Prompt Library
And finally, once you have started making prompts like this, you’ll want to share them across your team.
Building a prompt library is something I’d recommend every creative team out there does today.
It just saves so much time in people not rebuilding prompts that have already been built.

[1.08.25, 9:02:28] ~ Davide: If you would have low cash flow and you’d like to scale a custom product, what would you do? 
(Time of production: 20-25 days)
(Cost per product pretty high - $10)
[1.08.25, 9:41:11] ~ Filippo: Go slow
[1.08.25, 9:41:31] ~ Filippo: I took the risk last. Q4 and stripe banned me
[1.08.25, 11:24:39] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah, take it easy. A bad move and you lost momentum + all your money
[1.08.25, 11:38:55] ~ Davide: wouldn’t you consider any pre order strategy to accumulate more cash upfront?
[1.08.25, 12:12:59] ~ Michael: Did someone use a UK LLP for payment processing for ther US LLC? For PayPal mainly?

[1.08.25, 18:26:55] ~ Mason Schulze: Hey guys does anyone know work arounds to use mainstream sounds on video ads with meta, quite a few brands i follow doing big numbers i noticed using hit tracks and seems they have no problem. Can anyone shed some light with this? don't want to risk the ad account at all.
[1.08.25, 18:45:23] ~ Alexander Sundström: Do you guys have any recommendations for a good customer ticket system that handles returns, faulty goods, repairs etc?
[1.08.25, 19:53:53] ~ Bryan T: For anyone using checkoutchamp, do you recommend enabling the chargeback blacklist feature?
[1.08.25, 20:34:57] ~ Damiano: Zendesk is a good choice

[2.08.25, 7:17:53] ~ Jeb: Anyone have a simple way to track next-day funding when your processor’s batch cutoff (4pm) doesn’t match Shopify’s midnight reporting? Want to make ensure I’m getting paid what I’m owed, how are you guys reconciling?
[2.08.25, 14:52:26] ~ Michael: Anyone selling to India?
[2.08.25, 18:02:30] ~ Yuanda: anyone testing new hero products for their brand?

have any advice on strategy to this
[2.08.25, 18:02:33] ~ Yuanda: how much spend to commit , knowing when to double down
[2.08.25, 18:29:37] ~ Davide: I usually start with static ad - same ugly design for all of them (no fancy things) just headline and a simple product visual. 
You want to structure your headlines with accurate, thinking about the core messaging (desire + product awareness + sophistication) 

Make 2-3-4 ad sets based on your budget and I usually use CBO, and inside each ad set 3-5 ads.
In this way we’ll know from the start what works and WHY.
[2.08.25, 18:33:30] ~ Yuanda: i see and this it to test messaging that you will use on video ads
[2.08.25, 18:42:29] ~ Davide: Exactly
[2.08.25, 22:12:15] ~ michael: Hi does anyone use Weglot here?

[3.08.25, 11:08:50] ~ David: Yes, weve used it before
[3.08.25, 13:04:56] ~ Filippo: how much do you guys iterate on a breakingeven new creative concept?
[3.08.25, 16:14:22] ~ Mithiran: If it takes up majority of ad spend in a campaign
[3.08.25, 16:17:53] ~ Filippo: I know that, I meant how many hooks launched before you give up on that concept
[3.08.25, 16:19:12] ~ Mithiran: Oh my bad. Normally I do one set of changes, I’ll try to improve it if it doesn’t work I move on.

[3.08.25, 17:42:21] ~ Musawer: Anyone using shopify upsell app for other countries like UK, Australia, the one click upsell app not working for other countries i think
[3.08.25, 17:47:47] ~ Mason Schulze: shopify limitation, none of the apps will allow to show PP upsells for any customers outside of your stores set currency
[3.08.25, 17:52:39] ~ Mason Schulze: but you can customize the TY page with an upsell that will show for all

[4.08.25, 8:28:32] ~ Mai: Anyone else having issues paying Facebook in the last few hours?
[4.08.25, 8:33:38] ~ Kostić: no
[4.08.25, 8:47:12] ~ Max: actually last few days every CC bill for one of our accounts doesn’t g thru unless we charge manually, you’ve got the same?
[4.08.25, 8:59:11] ~ Mai: No nothing works also from different bank accounts/ cards… was curious if anyone else has this issue
[4.08.25, 9:00:06] ~ Mai: Yes tried manually
[4.08.25, 10:39:48] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Hey any connections to get a good price animator for getting animated BRolls for scientific clips with the product.
[4.08.25, 11:02:24] ~ P: Does anyone using Funnelish know how to automatically collect sales tax and have the customer pay it at checkout based on their state?
[4.08.25, 11:37:35] ~ Cocow😈: Like you have a BROLL and want to put bones, veins with medical 3d design ? If yes DM me i have a contact that works good, good price but a bit long to deliver
[4.08.25, 11:55:28] ~ Musawer: What if we change our current default store currency and market, right now it is USA, if we change it to Uk, will it work?
[4.08.25, 13:23:23] ~ RS: Hey! There are thousands of bot traffic coming in my website every day at the same time and it triggers pageview event and fkcs up pixel data. I have set up cloudflare and another shopify app that promises to block and filter bot traffic but still these bots go around it. Are there any good tips to block this traffic? They are visiting only my policy pages using linux devices. Wetracked.io said that they will not change their code to exclude policy pages from pixel tracking and I hate wetracked company about that. I cannot do anything to prevent pixel from firing in policy pages, only wetracked can but they dont want to do it. 

Maybe there are other options to block this linux traffic or prevent pixel from catching these pageview events?
[4.08.25, 13:27:39] ~ Nim: Yeah there is a solution. If there is a pattern in the IP addresses targetting these pages, you may need to create a block list (access-list) on the ISP.
Drop me a msg and I can explain in more detail
[4.08.25, 13:29:31] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Anyone here use producthero? - If you do, what do you think about it?
[4.08.25, 13:49:07] ~ Mo: guys who tried buying fake “trustpilot reveiews” whats ur overall experience ?

[4.08.25, 14:50:52] ~ Matt: I have someone good
[4.08.25, 14:51:01] ~ Matt: It is harder now to do it
[4.08.25, 14:51:13] ~ Matt: And can only do 1-3 max per day
[4.08.25, 15:21:26] ~ Tony: Does someone here know where to get a US co signer?
[4.08.25, 16:30:23] ~ Matthew Martorano: You can customize the blacklist. Your AM can show you how to do this.
[4.08.25, 16:57:17] ~ Mo: whats best way to get reviews ( more so video testimonial) from customers / especially repeated customers , im sending them an email with a free product in return and asking if they can make an honest video testimonial. any other recommendations/ best practices ?
[4.08.25, 20:08:52] ~ Guy Edan: Do u guys find that younger audiences convert better on Shopify type pages and checkouts VS on funnelish or not really?
[4.08.25, 20:43:25] ~ Charles: Maybe it’s just bc your launching ads
[4.08.25, 20:43:35] ~ Charles: Facebook sends bots everytime to look at your pages
[4.08.25, 21:01:00] Dark Lord Ecom Secrets ( Gethookd.ai community): ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ Adam Radwan and ~ 🔋
[4.08.25, 21:49:01] ~ Bryan T: For anyone using checkout champ w paypal, is their an app to auto sync tracking? Have looked at a few with no luck.
[4.08.25, 21:52:10] ~ Phil: I use trackbee. Maybe give that a try for pixel tracking. It’s also free up to 50k in revenue
[4.08.25, 21:52:43] ~ 🔋: Within the PayPal Commerce gateway settings in Checkout Champ, there is a specific option labeled sendFulfillmentTrackingNumber

When it’s enabled, the CRM will automatically send the tracking numbers for completed orders directly to PP if you meant this
[5.08.25, 3:41:59] ~ Gordon: Hello is a typical dropoff from Facebook outbound click to landing page view about 40%?

I.e 100 Facebook clicks, 60 website sessions?

We’ve optimized all our pages for speed but can’t seem to get the drop off lower than this.
[5.08.25, 4:49:32] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Should be 80+ bare minimum but aim for 90+
[5.08.25, 11:16:23] ~ Musawer: Facebook removed shop and we cant increase and decrease budget on our adset that include shop, anyone else has this issue? What do we need to do? Duplicate adsets?
[5.08.25, 14:47:48] ~ 🥇: Hey guys,is there any way to get in direct chat with Shopify’s finance or risk team? We keep getting the same response from general support saying they’re escalating our ticket, but nothing actually gets resolved. Appreciate any tips!

[5.08.25, 16:53:24] ~ Kostić: Looking for a person or agency that builds nice landing pages, if anyone has a recommendation please dm me!
[5.08.25, 16:56:44] ~ Growg: Yeah, I have my CRO guy who develop great landing page
[5.08.25, 20:33:11] ~ Mai: hey guys I’ve already asked here before, we use Gorgias for our customer support, and it’s super expensive. We’re ending up paying over $1K monthly for software that let’s be honest, isn’t really a game changer at all. we also don’t use all its features… we need something pretty basic. What other platforms do you use and recommend?
[5.08.25, 20:34:03] Topi: We just switched to “commslayer”

It’s close to gorgias already and with 5% of the price or less
[5.08.25, 20:34:29] Topi: The guys are updating the software every day
[5.08.25, 20:36:05] Topi: I challenge everyone in this group finding cheaper alternatives for the apps we all love to use, we recently went through this and literally 90% of the apps there is 10% cost app that gives you the same function 

Slack, monday, clickup, frame, hubstaff

Just do some googling and keep your opex as minimal as possible
[5.08.25, 20:38:37] ~ Mo: Used gorgias before got super expensive, using Reamaze now wonderful , same functionalities, fraction of the price
[5.08.25, 20:39:10] Topi: Yeah especially for gorgias there’s like 5 alternatives
[5.08.25, 20:39:21] ~ Mai: what’s your alternative to hubstaff? that has screenshots and everything ‎<This message was edited>
[5.08.25, 20:39:33] Topi: I just picked commslayer because I know the owner already built and exited another amazing software and he is passionate about making this tool the best
[5.08.25, 20:40:03] ~ Steve: 100% there’s almost always a cheaper alternative, and the ironic part is because they are smaller than the big apps, they usually are hungrier for your business. Better white glove service and CS
[5.08.25, 20:41:20] Topi: Yea man I remember recurpay treatment versus the skio etc giants

Same thing that took from skio +1 month to execute with issues these guys did in 12 hours and keep reaching out feedback if we need more help
[5.08.25, 20:43:34] ~ UHO: So y’all are out here micromanaging your staff? JK 😂
[5.08.25, 20:50:16] ~ 🔋: Can’t imagine something lower levarage than this lmao just give good KPIs and create a culture people enjoy working in
[5.08.25, 20:52:48] ~ Mai: Not when you hire VAs who move their mouse so the timer will run. we never check them but it’s good to have it in the records, for anything. we track the time anyway. it’s not meant for every employee / or agencies… but some of them do need it
[5.08.25, 20:56:57] Topi: In my early days I was using hubstaff 

Then when learned the ropes I become the “Culture is the king person” 

Now with more wisdom and experience I see again no issues using hubstaff when it serves your needs
[5.08.25, 20:57:28] ~ UHO: Moving their mouse so time will run, diabolical! 😂 

They really do that, but that is because they’ve been forced to use the time trackers in the first place, they don’t enjoy it, nobody does. 

If you assign reasonable KPIs and empower your staff, they’ll go all out for you, even work overtime and weekends. Try and see.

And guess what, when you create a healthy culture and work life balance, your employees are happy and when they are happy, they make your customers even happier, and a happy customer will bring referrals and repeat business.
[5.08.25, 20:58:09] Topi: “If you assign reasonable KPIs and empower your staff, they’ll go all out for you, even work overtime and weekends. Try and see.”

The argument for this would be is this scalable long term?
[5.08.25, 20:58:31] ~ Steve: yeah exactly right. It’s very effective with certain types of staff, and not so effective with other types of staff you have.
[5.08.25, 20:59:27] Topi: There’s really no one size fits all situations, the more I see inside actually functioning long term businesses the more I just realise its all about using your brain and doing what makes sense
[5.08.25, 21:22:12] ~ Shaan: Hey guys - we just did a huge launch on our new product called the Global USD account - you can get up to 4.5% interest on sitting deposits, it should be super awesome for international businesses! https://x.com/victorcardenas/status/1952791780119969930 ‎<This message was edited>
[5.08.25, 21:23:52] ~ 🔋: W
[5.08.25, 21:50:37] ~ m: How can you make people enjoy their work when the actual work itself is boring af. Can just “healthy/fun culture” do this?
[5.08.25, 22:07:31] ~ Matt: Richpanel is the best we’ve used and cheap
[5.08.25, 22:52:01] ~ Kyle Twohill: does anyone have a creative strategist they would be willing to refer to me? dm if so

[5.08.25, 22:59:15] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Feel free to contact him guys, he is my creative partner. He does all the strategy, moodboarding, storyboarding, shoots, editing, everything.
[6.08.25, 2:18:44] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Technical question regarding testing different angles on funnelish - if you test 4 angles using 4 different advertorials but same product/checkout page, would you put those 4 advertorial in the same funnel, or each angle different funnel? 
I hope the question is clear
[6.08.25, 9:07:23] ~ Mikael: Anyone else having issues with Klarna on Shopify payments? We run in the Nordic countries and launched afew new stores last month. some of them allready got Klarna de-activated despite minimal Disputes and super slow scaling.
[6.08.25, 9:18:23] ~ Alvaro De Prada: We use reamaze
[6.08.25, 9:50:22] ~ Rick: Hi everyone! Is there someone that has a nice swipe file for listicles? Or a list of brands that kill it with listicles? Thanks a lot 🙏🏼❤️
[6.08.25, 9:53:32] ~ Manoj Bashyal: hit me up brother
[6.08.25, 9:54:14] ~ Adam Radwan: Need that as well, listicles outperform advertorials almost Everytime for me
[6.08.25, 10:08:22] ~ Gideon: Whats the advantage of using apps for customer service instead of the traditional way?
[6.08.25, 10:10:02] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You have more details on the order right on the app, can create templates that auto populate with the customer/order info
[6.08.25, 10:40:14] ~ Mithiran: by traditional way do you mean gmail for example?
[6.08.25, 10:42:36] ~ Gordon: hello is anyone doing supplement manufacturing in USA with eagle? interested in working with them too. thanks
[6.08.25, 10:45:07] ~ Jonas Ma: Hey guys!

[6.08.25, 19:26:07] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: Not chase, but I opened a bank of america account with so ease, it felt like a hack. I was in LA for a 8 hour layover, went to a branch, gave my passport and voila haha

[6.08.25, 19:29:27] ~ Juanro: Normally they require to be in person to open it if you’re non-us citizen. But I know there are people and agencies with contacts inside certain banks that help you open accounts remotely. Normally requiring a certain amount of deposit, etc

[6.08.25, 19:31:22] ~ m: done thans

[6.08.25, 19:43:28] ~ Steve: also would recommend applying for ITIN now if you haven't
[6.08.25, 19:43:46] ~ Steve: 12+ weeks is current waiting time for that and you’ll need it in most cases for AMEX/Chase Sapphire
[6.08.25, 19:44:43] ~ Harsimran Sandhu: +1
[6.08.25, 19:47:34] ~ m: I think I have that for my USA LLC

[6.08.25, 21:09:26] ~ Steve: Was this before or after new trump admin? Everyone I've spoken to said before it was 1-3 weeks tops

[7.08.25, 10:56:31] ~ Filippo: people scaling in EU, are u guys successful with solution-teasing hooks mentioning a ‘medical term’ vs symptom?

i feel like the market is small that i would be better off working on ads that have hooks with the symptoms - fully problem aware

example:
back pain VS herniated disc
burning feet VS neuropathy ‎<This message was edited>
[7.08.25, 12:44:34] ~ Cocow😈: Depend where you sell in europe but market is not so small as this if you target germany and france for example. 

Depending on your hook you are going to get different awareness stages so i would suggest to test. We run more option 1
[7.08.25, 15:21:03] ~ Mai: Supplement brands- what app do you use for “subscribe & save” offers, that also has the option for the customer to pick how often does he want to receive the product (30/45/60 days..) thanks
[7.08.25, 15:21:43] ~ m: Loop

[7.08.25, 18:57:00] ~ Dorian: i use only SP and Stripe
[7.08.25, 19:04:47] ~ 🔋: If anyone non-US/US needs help with US-based signers for this we have a guy we’ve been using for a few years now
[7.08.25, 19:07:00] ~ Mike Ramsey: No, you dont.  There’s a couple providers in the US that can waive the ITIN requirement as long as you have solid fundamentals.

However having an ITIN opens you up for more processing options, but there are processors that will waive that requirement if business model is solid.
[7.08.25, 19:08:20] ~ Dorian: interesting thank you
[7.08.25, 19:44:40] ~ Mike Ramsey: No problem.  If you are looking for options without ITIN requirement feel free to DM and more than happy to help.

[8.08.25, 16:51:51] ~ Yusuf: We’re a German supps brand and currently facing serious risk around health claims on Meta. To reduce exposure, we’re considering an offshore Business Manager setup — similar to how it’s often done with Taboola.

Has anyone here set up a Meta BM through an offshore entity while still operating the store from their original (home) country?

Specifically:
- BM + payment method are tied to the offshore company
- But the store (or parts of the funnel) still tie back to a German entity
- How are you handling ad spend in that case?
- Do you invoice ad spend from the offshore to the main company? Or keep everything separate? Experienced any issues with there with Federal agencies?

Would really appreciate any insights — happy to take DMs if it’s sensitive.

They don’t take a US passport in the set up process, only an HKID. Although apparently in their policy they say it’s OK to use a passport instead. 

Waiting to hear back from Shopify Support (who also said it’s possible) but want to see what others in my situation have done as it’s been a few days and still waiting.

[10.08.25, 15:24:48] ~ Jacobo Uribe: It’s probably ArcAds using a custom avatar. I’d recommend creating the still image of your avatar in Ideogram as it’s super realistic. You can always use their “style reference” feature to make it easier to get what you want. 

Also, a bit underrated is Captions Mirage Studio. Similar price point as ArcAds and also very high quality.

[13.08.25, 15:52:46] ~ UHO: 1:1 is the best. Candidates just be refining their answers based on the previous candidates answer. You’ll most likely hire the wrong fit with the approach. It’s pretty much like seeing the questions to an exam before sitting for the exam.

If you’re too busy to have 1:1, just have them create videos and send to you.

We are there but since a few days our Amazon account isn’t delivering the ads for whatever reasons, but no block etc. But it’s massively impacting the revenue and our Amazon agency seems to not know what to do either here…

So if anyone has had this issue here aswell or some good Amazon insider I would appreciate any help 👍🏻
[13.08.25, 21:54:27] ~ Guy Edan: Check if u have any errors on your listing backend or even within the ads/ads setting themselves. Sometimes there is a hidden error somewhere
[13.08.25, 21:55:41] ~ Guy Edan: Those of u who run funnelish and Shopify, do you connect the same pixel both to funnelish and Shopify or do u separate? Can u even use the same one? (Up to now was using only funnelish but gonna test a Shopify page soon) ‎<This message was edited>
[13.08.25, 21:58:59] Carlos Leeseman: Just same pixel for both
[13.08.25, 22:08:34] ~ Maxi: Our agency checked and they haven’t found any issues actually

We’ve already appealed and even won one case last week, but it keeps getting removed again. This is killing our ability to run ads. Any connections or advice would be massively appreciated!

[14.08.25, 17:41:38] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. If you’re testing a new product and angles, do u create 2 pdp/sales pages for each angle (for example one is solving wrinkles and one is solving pigmentation) or do u send to 1 product page that talks about both and see which angle resonates most from ad data?
[14.08.25, 18:06:11] ~ Omar: yhh all good
[14.08.25, 18:50:17] ~ Gideon: last 14 days I had about 11.048 outbound clicks on meta. I had around 6256 landingpage view. Around 55% who clicks lands on my landingpage. Is this a normal stat like this or do I have a problem and should I make a better cookiebar for example or faster loading speed?
[14.08.25, 18:56:16] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: i’d keep the marketing angles on ads data level, different product pages only for testing different price points.

just different video ads and different interests for angles
[14.08.25, 19:03:58] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Well for the beauty niche and supplements what i follow is if you are doing a sales page (single page flow) then just make a badass format and just change the copy and visuals everytime you do a new avatar.

If you are doing two pages like adv > pdp or listicle > pdp.
Then have one pdp at start which is not targeted but only has reviews, other information which are not avatar specific and then you can have your first landing page avatar specific.

U can have a example here nuora does this thing the best:
https://mynuora.com/pages/5-reasons
[14.08.25, 19:31:32] ~ Guy Edan: That makes sense. I think I’ll test the angles on ad level + the advertorial and keep the pdp relatively broad and see from there what the data says
[14.08.25, 19:32:10] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah sounds good bro

[14.08.25, 23:07:40] ~ Powa: Happened to me as well. In my case, it wasn’t the landing page load speed, but the quality of traffic Facebook was sending (lower quality, maybe the account got flagged). We fixed this by using a completely new Facebook profile, page, BM, pixel, and domain, and our landing page view rate went back to 80%+
[15.08.25, 5:27:04] ~ Gordon: hi - we're looking to open US tiktok shop as a non-US resident. we have a US LLC.

is there any bypass for the "US representative" part? do TT shop agency accounts bypass this?

[15.08.25, 11:12:36] ~ Gideon: Okay, thanks. I have this bm and pixel for 7 + years so I dont think thats the case. I see I got a speed score of 41 so thats not very good I think

Ad Creatives Testing Framework
[15.08.25, 12:45:09] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: a bit of a long message but here it is:
[15.08.25, 12:48:03] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: *Creative Testing Framework (Ad Matrix Method)*

*Step 1*: Set Up a Google Sheet Matrix

*Top Row (X-Axis):*
List all your customer avatars (target audiences).
Example: Keto, Vegan, Parents, etc.

*Left Column (Y-Axis):*
List all your ad types.
Examples:

- UGC Video

- Feature Callout

- Testimonial (Static or Video)

- Founder Story

- Problem/Solution etc.

*Cells (Intersection):*
In each cell, write out pain points or desires relevant to that avatar and match them with an ad type — each one represents a new angle to test.

*Step 2: Testing Phases*

*Phase 1 – Angle Testing (Within One Avatar)*

- Pick one winning ad type that historically performs well (e.g., UGC Video).

- Use it to test multiple angles (pain points/desires) for a single avatar.

Example: Test 10 angles → Identify top 3 performers.

*Phase 2 – Format Expansion*

- Take the top 3 performing angles from Phase 1.

- Now test these angles across all your top-performing ad types.

- Find combinations of winning angles + winning ad types.

*Final Goal:*

Identify the best-performing avatar, angle, and ad type combination.

Once you find these winners, you scale and repeat.
[15.08.25, 12:51:24] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: this creative planner ensures i dont miss out on any marketing angles and lays out things very clearly for my editor. might be helpful for everyone here :) ‎<This message was edited>

[15.08.25, 18:29:37] ~ Filippo: like i say to only change the text hooks, and instead she makes 5 diff visual hooks
[15.08.25, 18:30:00] ~ Filippo: or like the broll quality is low (taken from the internet)

[15.08.25, 18:31:30] ~ Ben Mansour: He worked well with us, did you make a test trial?
[15.08.25, 18:31:45] ~ Filippo: no i didnt, only look at the port he shared
[15.08.25, 18:32:30] ~ Ben Mansour: Better to go for a trial, many clients do not allow their work to be shared in portfolio
[15.08.25, 18:33:43] ~ Filippo: ill do that then thanks
[15.08.25, 18:34:05] ~ Filippo: besides Asana, how do you ensure the process is smooth?
[15.08.25, 18:34:13] ~ Filippo: do u use gsheets connected to the editor, or smth?
[15.08.25, 18:35:08] ~ Filippo: AND do you have a different guy who source content from anywhere on the internet?
[15.08.25, 18:35:28] ~ Filippo: opening scene selection is important
‎[15.08.25, 18:37:19] ~ Ben Mansour: ‎image omitted
[15.08.25, 18:38:53] ~ Ben Mansour: in asana you structure like this, you create a task with the script idea, you put it in draft, when the script is ready you attach the doc to the task and move the task to ready, the editor takes it from there, when he finished teh first version of the creative, he attaches a frame.io link and moves the task to draft complete
[15.08.25, 18:39:33] ~ Ben Mansour: then you or the creative strategist, reviews the creative, put your comments on frame if there is any, then move it to edits needed or launch
[15.08.25, 18:40:12] ~ Ben Mansour: no need to communicate a lot with them like this, everybody has access to asana and they know their jobs
[15.08.25, 18:40:47] ~ Ben Mansour: for the content the editor usually gathers stock footage we need, idk how often they do it
[15.08.25, 22:57:20] ~ Yusuf: We do it exactly the same just with clickup though.

Clickup Board with different stages (scripting, content, cutting, review, launch,..)

And then in the task description we put the hook idea, body script with comments and also the raw footage/voiceovers.
[15.08.25, 22:58:00] ~ Yusuf: And after they're done they upload it to the task and we do a feedback loop with frame.io if it's not perfect yet

[15.08.25, 23:53:42] ~ Mo: When u find a creative ( VLS) that works on meta , how do u double down  on it :

- ⁠Test new variations of the same script 


Anything that i can add to the list ?
[16.08.25, 0:06:14] ~ Steve: - Scroll stoppers
- actor to do the script
- female actor to do the script
- new captions
- new caption style
- split screen the ad, run a sale banner on the right hand side
- add an AI avatar pointing up to the ad
- split screen the ad top to bottom, show someone on bottom watching the ad on their phone reacting to the ad
- take beat performing hooks and stack them together at the start ‎<This message was edited>
[16.08.25, 0:06:23] ~ Steve: Endless amount. We do several of these pretty regularly
[16.08.25, 0:07:23] Topi: Divide by soft iterations VS heavy iterations

Soft iterations are fast and easy such as headline iterations, scroll stopper iterations, changing video speed etc 

Heavy iterations are testing new leads or closes or recreating winning leads or body with new footage, changing actor

There’s at least 20 ways to iterate on VSL.

Start from soft iterations and see what happens

Later move into heavier

In the beginning you most likely find lots of winners with soft and later its harder

Just make sure you don’t burn your scaling profits into endless testing, quality over quantity, test budget max 20% of scaling budgets
[16.08.25, 0:08:09] Topi: Also stay organized so that you know what you’ve tested and what worked, what not, over time you see patterns and become more effective
[16.08.25, 0:10:21] ~ Mo: Cristal clear, Thanks bro
[16.08.25, 0:11:33] ~ Mo: Straight to the point thanks man !🙏🏽
How do u stay organized & make sure u not testing what uve already tested. Do u have a structure/systems for this ?
[16.08.25, 0:14:07] Topi: Just make a “script master sheet” where you always list all your scripts

Mark down winners / losers 

After winners, just have columns of iteration performed yes / now + result

Something like that, over time you can make it more complex and more tailored to your needs. Most important is just to get started being organized
[16.08.25, 0:14:55] ~ Steve: Find the iterations that seem to work well for you. Turn it into an SOP, then train video editors to do it automatically. We call it "winner treatment" and for most of those the editors can handle it themselves. Saves bandwith
[16.08.25, 7:22:54] ~ Pramesh: yo bro, can you intro me to this please?
[16.08.25, 10:23:30] ~ David: tiktok --> meta method is also working extremely well rn.

lets say youre in the beauty niche. 

Go on kalodata, look for best performing beauty ads. 

Take the best hooks and slap them on to your vsl.

70% hook rate is easy with this and you can easily double your VSL performance if you test enough hooks or revive old vsls that are fatgiged
[16.08.25, 10:25:13] ~ Mo: Im using ur exact sheet for scripts/briefs super helpful!

[16.08.25, 10:51:18] ~ Davide: Guys, ever happened to you that making iterations (changing the actors with the same script) FB does a little bit of retargeting and basically people see the ads with the same script/story just with different actors? 
It is pretty weird. 
Also people of course comment they wanted to buy but because of that, they didn’t trust anymore because it feels like a scam for them
[16.08.25, 11:45:51] ~ David: when we do creator iterations, we always let claude rephrase the script slightly
[16.08.25, 11:47:45] ~ David: we had the same thing happen before tho and prospects thought its a scam as well
[16.08.25, 12:01:21] ~ Davide: Same ahah even if we exclude the existing buyers
[16.08.25, 12:01:50] ~ Davide: After you did this, didn’t happen anymore?

[17.08.25, 21:46:30] ~ Michael: Hey guys, most of our ads get rejected lately. We sell a device to quit smoking. It worked 2 months pretty good but now 95% gets rejected. Even with muting words like zigarette/vape etc. And not mentioning everything concrete and not showing smoking szenes. 
We tried to used different ad accounts and nothing works. Meta and tiktok.

Does anyone have a solution?
[17.08.25, 21:47:04] ~ Tom: yeah, use paid services to get ur ads approved
[17.08.25, 22:23:36] ~ Dorn Edvin: Hey guys!:) We're looking for advice on persistent high CPM issues in Europe.
We're running ads in Hungary and we want to expend to various European countries (Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, etc.)
We've been struggling with very high CPMs in all of these countries(25-40$ and in Hungary we have 7-8$ CPM)To try to fix it, we: ✅ Created a new FB page ✅ Set up a new pixel ✅ Started using a new ad account on a different Business Manager
And we are using our own, self-made creatives. (We tried image and video ads also) We made another shopify store for each country, translated it with chatgpt and proofread them with a fivverr freelancer.
Unfortunately, none of these changes made a difference after we spent hundreds of dollars on the tests, our CPMs remain extremely high.(these $25-40 CPM’s are extremely high for these small 10-20M size countries)
At this point, we're wondering:
Who should we reach out to for help?
Any advice would be super helpful and we really appreciate if someone could help us. Thank you in advance! 💙
[17.08.25, 22:55:19] ~ David: Use an Agency
[17.08.25, 22:56:30] ~ David: Have you translated your creatives as well or only the LP
[17.08.25, 23:25:12] ~ Dorn Edvin: ‎This message was deleted.
[17.08.25, 23:25:24] ~ Dorn Edvin: Yes I have translated both
[17.08.25, 23:34:11] ~ Michael: Any recommendations ?
[17.08.25, 23:52:19] ~ UHO: ‎This message was deleted.
[17.08.25, 23:52:40] ~ UHO: High CPMs like $25–40 in those markets usually mean Meta doesn’t trust ur acct yet. Splitting into new stores, new pixels, new domains makes it worse cause you’re always starting from zero.
[17.08.25, 23:53:34] ~ UHO: Best fix is to stick to one store + pixel, warm up accts wit cheap engagement/video view ads, and go broad with targeting. Don’t over-layer interests. Also make sure domain + events are set up right. Local feel in ads (slang, refs, payments) helps too.

[18.08.25, 15:51:51] ~ Mo: I clone real voices
[18.08.25, 15:51:53] ~ Mo: Much better
[18.08.25, 16:26:00] ~ David: We use prompts to create an AI Voice.

Then on top of that we have someone native that reads out the text with the right pronunciation.

This way the ai voice sounds 100% real. Theres no way anyone can hear its ai
[18.08.25, 16:27:23] ~ M: which software do u use for the ai voice
[18.08.25, 16:48:25] ~ Mai: Do you mean he’s just doing the proofreading? Or something else?
[18.08.25, 17:08:10] ~ Marlon Martinez: hey, does someone know a payment processor that has Ideal? 

2M/ month processing volume
[18.08.25, 17:12:09] ~ Damiano: Mollie or Airwallex
[18.08.25, 17:44:06] ~ Yusuf: There’s a feature in elevenlabs studio where you can put in a voice recording where you read the text with the exact pronunciation you want. So it’s basically more like a voice changer

[18.08.25, 19:12:40] ~ N: I just let fb chose the best one
[18.08.25, 19:12:45] ~ N: Never messed around with thumbnails
[18.08.25, 20:10:25] ~ Damiano: Hi, do you mean you just upload the video without touching any thumbnail settings?

[19.08.25, 3:16:48] ~ Pramesh: yo guys so i found an ad that just 3x our spend overnight while also taking roas from 1.8 to 2.8, it's super winner but it keeps on getting rejected. Used an insider and they do get it approve but it goes down again in like 3-12 hours. I just keep on approving them but is there any other way?
[19.08.25, 3:16:59] ~ Pramesh: Claims aren't aggressive at all but it is AI generated
[19.08.25, 3:19:53] ~ Pramesh: took spend from 3k to 9k in a day
[19.08.25, 4:26:57] ~ Phil: Tweak it and reupload it again. This used to happened to me and that seemed to fix the issue
[19.08.25, 5:30:16] ~ 🥇: Hi guys , are you pre-checking the email/SMS marketing box at checkout for stores in Europe/UK? Even though GDPR says it’s not compliant, is it actually okay in practice and not risky for the account?
[19.08.25, 8:25:50] ~ Pramesh: yeah I have been doing this forever but the thing is performance is never same on those, might have to do that if I don't find any other ways
[19.08.25, 10:19:04] ~ Gideon: Shopify payments. Mollie
[19.08.25, 10:22:10] ~ Gideon: I do for email in NL. As far as I know its not compliment but itngives me a lotnofnextrq sucscribers. Do this for 7+ years on 1 store

[19.08.25, 20:44:42] ~ -J: anyone have connect for signers ibo? for US mids?
[19.08.25, 22:05:55] ~ Mike Ramsey: Wouldn’t recommend this.  Have kept a close eye on these services for last few years and lots are scams or super high risk for the users.   Plus very expensive.  If used, it needs to be super controlled or 1 to 1 MID / entity set-up.

Most load up a bunch of MID’s for multiple businesses on one signer and then the whole house can come crashing down if one business under that signer has high disputes or issues.  They can get flagged for MATCH list or some violation, then the other businesses can lose their processing.

If you are looking for processing, there are tons of US processors that can leverage an ITIN or even waive the requirement as long as biz is low or medium risk / good fundamentals and not black hat.

Or you can leverage a merchant of record provider. ‎<This message was edited>
[20.08.25, 2:12:19] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Testing a new product with like 8 different creative styles and 3 different advertorials - is doing a $10-$15 budget per advertorial ($30-45 total for each creative, but spread between the 3 adv) is spreading it too thin in your opinion? 
Hope what I mean is clear ‎<This message was edited>
[20.08.25, 7:13:03] ~ Robin: Hey guys, anyone that has a Meta insider?
[20.08.25, 7:13:57] ~ Tariq: Depends on country , if its US yes it's too thin

[20.08.25, 11:34:38] ~ Tony: Use passport
[20.08.25, 11:34:40] ~ Mo: im not thats the problem

[20.08.25, 11:37:48] ~ Tony: Personal I can’t give arvice
[20.08.25, 11:37:54] ~ Tony: Business wise there are ways to add a local director
[20.08.25, 11:38:02] ~ Tony: But personal it isn’t
[20.08.25, 11:38:24] ~ Mo: yeah sucks bro

[20.08.25, 12:17:40] ~ K: EU banking is so sus bro I would also recommend UAE there your money is safe from their mood swings
[20.08.25, 12:36:59] ~ Mat: Can you open up a bank without living there?
[20.08.25, 12:37:20] ~ K: You need emirates ID

[20.08.25, 14:01:02] ~ Alex Lever: Hey guys, I’ve got an FDA officer reviewing all my stuff. He’s said that I need to remove all claims as I don’t have 510(k) clearance. Has anyone dealt with this situation with before? Or have a contact who could help?
[20.08.25, 14:05:45] ~ Adam Radwan: Ive had a situation like that, but we just were advised to soften claims and not use direct ones “supports” “helps” “might” “may increase”
[20.08.25, 14:13:12] ~ Alex Lever: Yeah that’s what I thought, so I sent back my amended copy but he said I could even mention any condition at all. He even had issue with the general phrase ‘increase confidence’. 

Did they look at your ads too or just your website?
[20.08.25, 14:13:23] ~ Davide: I have one great tutorial from the founder
[20.08.25, 14:15:43] ~ Adam Radwan: main review came from ttshop not meta
[20.08.25, 17:33:38] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Question - launched a new brand with a new pixel, and Facebook is showing ads to 90% elder demographic, but the product is not only for them. It can be used by any age. Would you limit the age on future ads to test?
[20.08.25, 17:59:08] ~ Henry: That’s because your ads are only appealing to elder, the targeting is not the problem ‎<This message was edited>
[20.08.25, 18:01:14] ~ Henry: We noticed this especially when we used someone in our ads that look old old, white hair and everything. It just automatically appeal to older audience
[20.08.25, 18:02:43] ~ Henry: Just make the script and visuals more appealing for younger audience as well
[20.08.25, 18:31:08] ~ Guy Edan: Makes sense. Will test different creative styles and see if changes. Thanks @⁨~Henry⁩
[20.08.25, 19:16:21] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: hey guys need a advice when a adset overspends with a unprofitable cpa do u cap it and how long before u kill it? (will definitely make iterations though)
[20.08.25, 19:57:05] ~ Mo: guys who post organic on social media ( Tiktok, instagram)  ( but they dont live in the country where they post, they live in a different country). Lets say i wanna target the US but i dont live in the US

How do u make sure your post target the right country/market ? what u guys recommend 

- Get someone from the US to create Tiktok/IG acctt with US sim card

Would this work ?
[20.08.25, 20:36:40] ~ David: US SIM card + US vpn
[20.08.25, 20:36:50] ~ David: Phone needs to be set to US region
[20.08.25, 20:37:08] ~ David: You don’t need someone from the US for this
[20.08.25, 21:45:16] ~ m: yo guys, my bro has a hk HK with airwallex bank he doesnt need, anyone wanna buy it? it was opened in oct 2023. obv you will have to change ownership to someone else's/your name. nothing can be run under his name. he has no price in mind currently. DM me if interested. thanks
[20.08.25, 22:02:51] ~ Davide: If it is spending there is a reason. Focus on why fb is putting most of the ad spend inside that ad set.
Anyway if this affects the overall performance on fb, I’d turn it off after 4-6 days 
But you want to keep that in mind and test new iterations on it ‎<This message was edited>
[20.08.25, 23:44:59] ~ Ben Mansour: How can we take down a store that‘s using our brand name, content, literally same website and our ads on facebook as well
[20.08.25, 23:47:36] ~ Mai: If it’s on Shopify you have to send Shopify an email with some screenshots and information 
I did it once and it worked
[20.08.25, 23:48:19] ~ Daniel: Have you sent him an email yet? Filling in dmca forms on Shopify and Meta takes some time to get processed
[20.08.25, 23:50:30] ~ Daniel: I send this to guys ripping our stuff, most of the time its offline in a couple hours - send it to all the email adresess you can find:

[21.08.25, 3:43:39] ~ Shri Kanase: What ad platform?
[21.08.25, 4:04:50] ~ Mai: For brand owners operating in multiple markets, do you manage everything under one store with the market settings, or do you set up a store for each market? What’s a better overall approach? For doing post purchase upsells and other stuff that can limit you when you have different markets under the same Shopify store. Thanks
[21.08.25, 4:15:39] ~ Monaesh: Meta mostly but Youtube as well

Do you have any recommendations for someone who can help create static AI image ads from existing product photos?

Also curious to know:

Would really appreciate any tips or referrals 🙏

[21.08.25, 16:25:23] ~ Steve: just get an account there, it has VEO3 generation as an option
[21.08.25, 16:25:38] ~ Steve: i think it burns credits at a higher rate, but higgsfield is less per month, so it all probably works out
[21.08.25, 16:25:41] Carlos Leeseman: I think we have it with our Google Workspace plan
[21.08.25, 16:25:47] ~ Steve: but anyways, you can use VEO3 right in Higgsfield
[21.08.25, 16:32:59] ~ Cocow😈: Take Google ULTRA AI in google workspace, but costs like 200 bucks. But, what you can do is amazing so maybe worth
[21.08.25, 16:36:47] ~ chris: Will check these out guys! Thanks alot
[21.08.25, 16:44:54] ~ Marlon Martinez: But you can still not upload attatchments correct?
[21.08.25, 16:54:10] ~ Cocow😈: ah no i do not think so
[21.08.25, 16:58:39] ~ Rick: What you mean by attachments?
[21.08.25, 16:58:59] ~ Marlon Martinez: reference images or videos
[21.08.25, 17:03:25] ~ Rick: Got it thanks
[21.08.25, 18:10:30] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. We just started using gem pages in addition to funnelish. Where do u see the flow conversions between pages? (For example how many people went from the the listicle to the pdp)
[21.08.25, 19:08:36] ~ Filippo: hey guys, does any of your advertorials ever had great CTR but actually lowered cvr?
[21.08.25, 19:31:05] ~ Steve: yes
[21.08.25, 19:31:53] ~ Steve: often has happened when we had a CTR button too high up - like on a listicle or a long form ADV we’d put a CTR button on the top right corner and we’d notice that people clicking that were low intent because they hadn’t read the sales message
[21.08.25, 19:32:01] ~ Steve: not always, and depends on the offer but have seen that before
[21.08.25, 19:37:03] ~ Andrej: Yo guys, what’s the minimum spend on applovin?

[22.08.25, 10:24:30] ~ Filippo: hey guys, big problem, I’m noticing a HUGE difference between unique outbound clicks (ads manager) and sessions on Shopify:

78 vs 44…what is going on?
[22.08.25, 10:26:04] ~ Filippo: landing page is built on Replo
[22.08.25, 10:29:17] Carlos Leeseman: High bouncing rate? What is your page speed?
[22.08.25, 10:30:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Cookies maybe
[22.08.25, 10:48:40] ~ Filippo: it’s weird cause first i tested with advertorial (replo) and it was fine, now im testing sales page only (replo) and i got this problem
[22.08.25, 10:49:23] Carlos Leeseman: Check your page speed
[22.08.25, 10:49:33] Carlos Leeseman: Advertorial normally has higher page speed then sales page
[22.08.25, 10:49:42] Carlos Leeseman: Specially if you have a lot of graphics there
‎[22.08.25, 10:50:07] ~ Filippo: ‎image omitted
[22.08.25, 10:50:49] Carlos Leeseman: Yep that’s pretty bad man, you want at least 90
‎[22.08.25, 10:52:22] ~ Filippo: ‎image omitted
[22.08.25, 10:53:07] ~ Mason Schulze: Not really bad at all that speed, test some major brands sites loading speeds there scores are very low
[22.08.25, 10:53:23] ~ Mo: im in the same situation bro, 80% adv ( gempages) then 59% pdp shopify
[22.08.25, 10:53:43] ~ Filippo: any solutions?
[22.08.25, 10:53:53] ~ Filippo: im thinking to screw replo and just build a standard pdp with shrine
[22.08.25, 10:54:04] Carlos Leeseman: You want a good developer who can ensure that the desktop view and mobile view consist of the same section and look responsive on both devices. This makes a huge difference. You also want all image assets to be in webp. file format, max 50-70kb. Don't upload your assets directly to Replo, but upload them to Shopify and then use the cdn link.
[22.08.25, 10:54:06] ~ Filippo: interesting…so whats the problem
[22.08.25, 10:54:27] ~ Filippo: any guy you recommend?
‎[22.08.25, 10:54:54] ~ Mason Schulze: ‎Contact card omitted
[22.08.25, 10:55:35] Carlos Leeseman: Any good page builder can do this, check UpWork or Fiverr
[22.08.25, 10:55:42] Carlos Leeseman: Need some code for this as well
[22.08.25, 10:55:47] ~ Mo: idk bro, there are bunch of guys on fiver, but they dont do shit , they just trick ggle to give better page speed score, but the speed remains the same ‎<This message was edited>
[22.08.25, 10:56:11] Carlos Leeseman: But that will help a lot, because then you’re able to remove 50% of your page sections, what will increase page speed
[22.08.25, 10:56:45] Carlos Leeseman: Hiring a “page speed” guy for this makes no sense, it’s just about what I was saying here above
[22.08.25, 10:57:10] ~ Filippo: what’s an acceptable % of clicks actually making it to the pdp VS ads manager clicks?
[22.08.25, 10:57:36] ~ Filippo: never had this problem but if i had to guess would say 80%?
[22.08.25, 11:01:24] ~ Filippo: thanks
[22.08.25, 11:02:49] ~ Mo: is there another way to know overall bounce rate ? other than ads manager clicks vs landing page sessions ? ( i run multichannel meta, tt, snap etc..)

[22.08.25, 11:18:56] ~ Mo: what u guys have ?

[23.08.25, 15:46:52] ~ Damiano: Hi guys, do you recommend testing pre-landers on creatives that have already been tested and have had good ROAS or break-even ROAS? If so, can I run pre-lander tests in the same CBO where the same creatives are running directly to the PDP?

[24.08.25, 12:18:12] ~ Andrej: Pretty high. Depends heavily on the type of LP and how warm the traffic is and what awareness level. But we’re usually seeing around 70% bounce rate. Close to 90% is definitely high.
[24.08.25, 12:41:04] ~ Mo: Got it. Running snapchat acctually. So low intent probably that’s the reason its so high

[25.08.25, 17:34:59] ~ Damiano: Hi everyone, regarding creative tests, do you recommend launching a batch once a week containing iterations + new concepts, or is it better to split the batch throughout the week to provide a constant stream of new input? I wonder if testing the batch once a week could create instability during the week due to the lack of new input.
[25.08.25, 18:15:19] ~ Filippo: do u guys do BOGO with Shrine or use separate app?
[25.08.25, 18:22:08] ~ Davide: I would say imo is better to testing once a week if you don’t have high volume quantity testing. 
Also try to schedule in the first days or the weeks

[26.08.25, 10:05:06] ~ Diletta: you have to connect only a new subdomain to heyflow! if you choose for example "quiz", you will add in heyflow as domain "quiz.brandname.com" and in your domain provider, you will create a new DNS with "quiz" as name. They have a guide to create the new DNS for different major providers (such as godaddy etc.) ‎<This message was edited>
[26.08.25, 10:18:51] ~ Mo: Yeah i fucked up, my shole shopify store was redirecting to heyflow. Thanks @⁨~Diletta⁩ !
[26.08.25, 10:49:23] ~ Rick: do you guys consider this to be the best quiz builder app for Shopify? or are there other good recommendations?
[26.08.25, 10:49:29] ~ Rick: @⁨~Diletta⁩
[26.08.25, 10:55:07] ~ Diletta: It's definitely a great app. Even with the basic functions, you can create a nice flow, and with some code requested from ChatGPT, you can customize it even further. You can do A/B testing, add your domain.. Several competitors I've seen who have quizzes are using it, so I decided to use it too
[26.08.25, 10:56:23] ~ Mo: Just built my first one, hired one guy and he coded. Can share contact if needed
[26.08.25, 10:58:27] ~ Rick: what will you be able to integrate for example with some custom coding there?
[26.08.25, 11:24:14] ~ Diletta: For example, I have seen dynamic content based on previous responses. For example, let's say you ask for their date of birth in a question. In a summary sheet further on, you can put a custom code that calculates and displays the person's age as data. It gives the impression that everything is much more customized based on the customer's responses
[26.08.25, 15:35:48] ~ Nikola Petkov: Hey guys, just wanted to share a quick recommendation. I’ve been working with this editor for a while now on my brand (health/beauty niche), and honestly, he’s been great. I’ve worked with a lot of editors before and could never find the right one — most just throw in random effects and fancy edits, but this guy actually gets storytelling and the psychology behind ads, which is exactly what I needed.

Since we’ve slowed down on ads lately, I’m not giving him as much work, so I thought I’d help him out because he really deserves it. 

If you want to ask me anything more specific about my experience, feel free to reach out, but here’s his number if anyone’s interested: +359 879 282 565.

[26.08.25, 17:56:15] ~ Mai: Question - I have a brand that I scaled to about 10 markets (a few years ago)

and for each market we created a new website
the question is - is there anything that can really limit me if I use shopify market feature VS creating a new store for the market?

of course that it’s super hard to manage them all, but I’m talking about certain apps and features (mainly upsells, post purchase upsells, email marketing and so on) that you can’t really differentiate when all the markets (different languages and currencies) are under the same store?

[27.08.25, 14:21:01] ~ Zsombor: Got suspended for unpaid invoice. We can't pay it manually either, it says we don't have permission. (As the admin) So it's a software bug in their system.

[27.08.25, 17:55:36] ~ Daniel: Hey guys! I was wondering if verifying a new Meta Business Manager with a company, that already verified another BM could cause any issues, bans etc..? That other BM has been sold since and has been verified with the buyer's company.
[27.08.25, 17:58:52] ~ AK: No it should be fine
[27.08.25, 17:59:00] ~ AK: I have verified multiple bms with same LLC details
[27.08.25, 18:04:53] ~ Daniel: thank you!
[27.08.25, 18:09:43] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you guys think claude is the best ai for copywriting?
[27.08.25, 18:22:54] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Had best results with it
[27.08.25, 18:24:14] Carlos Leeseman: Oh yeah for sure! Claude is way more creative for me and is almost everytime outperforming GPT. I do my research and foundation in GPT and then move to Claude for writing process ‎<This message was edited>
[27.08.25, 18:25:39] ~ Kyle Twohill: makes sense, I notice GPT is always super robotic for my copy and I have to really modify things manually to get it more natural
[27.08.25, 18:27:41] Carlos Leeseman: Yep exactly, it's not the conversational language you want when it comes to copy. Especially not when you're creating VSL and playing on emotions and desires. Claude is much better at incorporating the information in your foundational documents into the copy and uses much better metaphors, etc
[27.08.25, 18:28:38] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: how exactly are you guys using claude, just using a basic chat, or training projects?
[27.08.25, 18:28:40] Carlos Leeseman: However, keep experimenting, sometimes GPT comes up with better output. For ideation creation, GPT and Gemini are very good. Deepseek also remains good for ideation in my opinion.
[27.08.25, 18:29:34] Carlos Leeseman: I’m using projects with 4/5 foundational documents, not more. Only when I’m writing copy for new angle, I upload extra research & avatar document in the chat
[27.08.25, 18:29:59] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: bro usually how me and people I know do it is u train a claude project every angle u do, also make sure the docs u upload u upload in text format, I figured out that claude cannot recall and read pdfs this is very strange.
[27.08.25, 18:30:04] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: so just begin a basic chat and keep feeding references and getting desired outputs
[27.08.25, 18:32:03] ~ UHO: Could be just a prompting problem.
[27.08.25, 18:33:47] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: i also feed docs on what a good direct response copy writing is for the type of creative u r gonna do like for VSLs its different than normal ugc style ai videos, it does better this way
[27.08.25, 20:05:28] ~ Shri Kanase: Anyone here know any solid Tiktok Shop / Applovin / Taboola freelancers who get results for eCom brands?
[27.08.25, 20:58:26] ~ M: Hi anyone have experience with b2b software, DM me
[27.08.25, 21:04:38] ~ A: Claude even better than gpt5?
[27.08.25, 21:06:03] ~ A: I make ad copys using the agent of chatgpt when testing for fashion to search for why people buy these piece of clothing, problems they face, solutions, age group, and to make 2 adcopys based on those searches
[27.08.25, 21:06:16] ~ A: Never used Claude tbh
[27.08.25, 21:13:54] ~ Steve: Yes, for copy. Far superior
[27.08.25, 22:41:58] ~ harshil Thummar: Anyone running cost caps on meta, give me insight on that , it's working for long term or what will be stretegy for it?
[27.08.25, 22:46:28] ~ Gideon: We use it for scaling campaigns
[27.08.25, 22:46:54] ~ Gideon: Cbo with inflated cc
[27.08.25, 22:48:51] ~ Gideon: So you cam forst test which cc works. For example your aov is 80. Try cc 60 80 and 100 in single adset. Once you find which one gives best results you can try to put winners in cbo and use the winning CC. Once cc cbo is performing well you can scale further
[27.08.25, 22:57:02] ~ Guy Edan: anyone got an excel financial model template for subscriptions?
[27.08.25, 22:57:51] ~ Guy Edan: Trying to calculate the best prices and see how it will look long term
[27.08.25, 23:40:48] Topi: Was today someone asking here for AW ticket? I got a spare one
[28.08.25, 0:52:24] ~ Rustam: Use it with great success for over a year. Just set your initial cap at your breakeven point, if it doesn’t spend, increase up to 20%. If it doesn’t spend even then, it means your creatives aren’t good enough. I use asc with all winners inside for cc
[28.08.25, 0:54:46] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: +1 need it too
[28.08.25, 1:22:12] ~ Yusuf: +1

[28.08.25, 1:48:12] ~ Guy Edan: Where does one find it?
[28.08.25, 7:14:06] Mads Nielsen: Anybody who have any good advice for what to do if your Meta ad account gets restricted? ‎<This message was edited>
[28.08.25, 8:56:59] ~ Steph: Depends on the reason. Have a insider if you need.
[28.08.25, 9:05:52] ~ Matt: Just Google it and you will find it with a link ‘lightspeed VC cohort model’
[28.08.25, 9:08:35] ~ Gideon: You use for everything. Or winners only?
[28.08.25, 10:41:49] ~ Mo: guys do u notice any kind of uplift adding a customer support live chat to ur website( for products that needs more explaining, reassurance…) anyone AB tested that ?

[28.08.25, 15:24:27] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Anybody experienced with SDH logistic company and how they use fake shipping labels for lesser shipping prices? 

Best fulfill told me about it and i wanted to ask out here if that's true.
[28.08.25, 17:11:56] ~ A: Is there anybody that has experience with VAX in Ireland? I want to have the policies so that the customer pays the VAX
[28.08.25, 18:19:02] ~ Shri Kanase: Does anyone know any solid Google ads freelancer / media buyer in the Ecom space looking for more work? Paying up to $100 for a good referral
[28.08.25, 18:22:32] Topi: Yes
[28.08.25, 18:33:21] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. When u launch a new creative in a one CBO campaign, do u set it for tomorrow 12am or since the CBO is running anyways, u just let the new creative start from today?
[28.08.25, 18:34:01] ~ Felix: Just launch it right away, as of my experience this doesn't make a difference
[28.08.25, 18:55:43] ~ Guy Edan: Also, do u guys have a max how many active ad sets in a CBO campaign? Contemplating if to start creating new CBOs once I reach a good amount in there but not sure if needed. What do think ‎<This message was edited>
[28.08.25, 21:18:00] ~ Al: Keep it consolidated in one campaign as much as possible. You need huge scale for multiple campaigns for one product to make sense
[28.08.25, 23:20:02] ~ Michael: Guys what service do you use for VAT registration in several countries?
[29.08.25, 0:02:30] ~ Damiano: You just need to do the IOSS registration in your country, where you have the tax residence, and you can pay taxes through IOSS
[29.08.25, 0:03:37] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Or where the stock will be located I think
[29.08.25, 0:03:53] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I think Amazon offers the service
[29.08.25, 0:04:36] ~ Damiano: Yes
[29.08.25, 0:04:50] ~ Damiano: It collects VAT for you
[29.08.25, 0:05:21] ~ Michael: But ioss is only for EU, what about UK Canada NZ AUS USA
[29.08.25, 0:06:28] ~ Damiano: It works differently for sure but the concept is the same
[29.08.25, 0:06:43] ~ Damiano: It’s easy if you delegate to the right advisor
[29.08.25, 0:07:05] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah… if you need for everything is best to speak to an international tax advisor
[29.08.25, 0:26:18] ~ Riccardo Sonetti: Hi guys, today Shopify disabled my Shopify Payments account saying it was due to too many disputes. Our chargeback rate is only 0.6%, which is low. 
I’ve already submitted the requested documentation but I’m not sure if they will reactivate it. 
I’ve also seen on Twitter that this happened to many others.
On top of that, they’re holding the balance for 120 days.
Has anyone found a solution for this?
[29.08.25, 0:27:00] ~ Michael: Thanks
[29.08.25, 0:34:19] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: dmed
[29.08.25, 0:53:09] ~ A: Anyone here know how VAT works in Ireland for dropshipping? My biz is NL based, supplier in China, selling B2C in Ireland (over the €10k EU limit). In NL we have art. 23 to shift VAT is there something similar in Ireland or do you just go with IOSS/OSS or a local tax rep so it doesn’t eat all your margin? ‎<This message was edited>
[29.08.25, 0:58:18] Topi: You have basically 2 options

Pay the vat

Commit a tax fraud

Pick one

[29.08.25, 21:13:54] ~ Guy Edan: What do u guys do if someone orders 3 units with subscription (very low price compared to one time) and immediately sends an email to cancel the subscription. Do u just cancel or do u have a policy against that?
[29.08.25, 21:23:13] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I just cancel subscription and let him keep the price
[29.08.25, 21:23:50] ~ Mikael: Hey fam. Whats the best business banking for UK LTD? Fees etc.
[29.08.25, 21:39:26] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Let them know is a one time courtesy
[30.08.25, 4:00:53] ~ Mike Kasdorf: I had this with one brand. I introduced subscriptions, then suddenly had everyone buying the subscription price, then automatically asking to cancel. Given the volume I figured it was ppl gaming the system, so I added a stated policy that subscribers had to purchase at least 3 times before cancelling or they'd have to make up the difference to full price to cancel early. I've had a lot fewer "accidental" subscribers since then, and everyone else who has cancelled early has paid back the difference, no questions asked.
[30.08.25, 11:40:34] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Did CB % increase?
[30.08.25, 16:31:11] ~ M: hi, does anyone run in france do i need to enable cartes bancaires on stripe and connect that to my shopify?

[30.08.25, 19:10:15] ~ Austin: ALSO - Send a labor day sale Email and SMS blast to your list, promoting some special offer for the weekend holiday, all we did was mark up the price by 36% and call it 36% off sale. Not to brag, but our sales are up 102% today and it's only noon. It's only Saturday and this is "Labor Day Weekend" you guys can still capitalize on this. Would suggest to double down on it as we speak if you sell US.

[30.08.25, 19:14:09] ~ Austin: How do you guys surf scale? Do you just double budget every hour? Will it mess anything up? Would love to know.

Make sure that after each raise the roas maintains and still getting sales. You can take screenshot of the results for that day , label it in google docs

[1.09.25, 22:10:40] ~ Alvaro De Prada: What size are they in pixels
[1.09.25, 22:11:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Try to make them 9:16 about 300px or so wide
[1.09.25, 22:12:01] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Keep playing with the size and compression till goes low enough. 35MB is too much

[1.09.25, 22:13:35] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Top 3 of Google searches are good enough
[1.09.25, 22:13:54] ~ Alvaro De Prada: By modifying the size you won’t need to compress a lot

[2.09.25, 18:00:16] ~ Austin: 3.5k base pay and then capped pay at 15K a month if rev/profit goals are hit. Make these high and you’ll see the killers will hit them if not exceed the performance expectations. Just ensure what ever they’re paid they bring back atleast 5X the return in profit and preferably much more. ‎<This message was edited>

[3.09.25, 6:21:58] ~ 🥇: For SMS marketing, do we always need to add a consent checkbox at checkout, or is there another way? I noticed some stores don’t have it but still send SMS. When I tried it with Klaviyo, it blocked sending to customers who didn’t consent, even though I collected their numbers . Also which SMS app do you prefer ?
[3.09.25, 6:26:03] ~ Manoj Bashyal: For taking consent during checkout. I know a tool that does the personalized consent collection based on the geography and after using the app, the sign up rate increased by 80%. 

Also, it is illegal to send sms without consent in some countries and also unethical. 

We used to use Yotpo, since it is shutting down, so we migrated sms into klaviyo.
[3.09.25, 6:28:17] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Feel free to hit me up if you want to learn more about the consent collection app. This is adding extra $10-20k rev/month, with just $200 subscription cost.

Potentially you've opened another google ads acc before with same info re circumventing systems.
[4.09.25, 15:25:22] ~ Diletta: Hello guys! I need a truly reliable contact to open an American LLC as a non-resident and who can then help me manage it and ensure everything is compliant. Can you recommend anyone?
[4.09.25, 15:32:57] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: firstbase.io
[4.09.25, 16:11:39] ~ Austin: Does anyone here know how to connect checkout champ and wetracked for correct tracking set up? This is my first time I've set it up and just need to share few screenshots to be sure all is good.
[4.09.25, 16:12:37] ~ Austin: I've personally always used multiple ad sets, and have been happy with results.
[4.09.25, 16:14:59] ~ Yusuf: We use one adset and it works fine too
[4.09.25, 16:19:24] ~ Al: we tried wetracked for a month and it was a pretty tough month. When we turned it off and got back to Meta CAPI, things got better immediately. Granted the switch was for the month of August which is generally a bit slow but not THAT slow. So it could've been the time as well not just the tracking. 

I tried like a madman to get anyone in their team to explain to me how it's better than Meta CAPI and nobody was able to explain anything. Only big fluff words. Even asked the founder and he would not tell me anything unless I jumped on a call.

I'm not saying it doesn't work, it just didn't work for us and I personally did not feel good about paying for a software that nobody in their team or anything in their help center can explain why it's better than the free solution from the trillion dollar company who benefits the most with proper tracking
[4.09.25, 16:25:52] ~ Austin: Well said
[4.09.25, 16:27:47] ~ Joel Cederlund: Intressting! I just use it because everyone says I should. Not actually seen the difference. 

Also talked to a meta rep some time ago who help me set up some setting in meta for better tracking since I explained it was a problem
[4.09.25, 16:35:13] ~ Mo: guys ASC no longer exists right ?
[4.09.25, 16:39:10] ~ Al: what did they help you set up if you don't mind?
[4.09.25, 16:39:12] ~ AK: Hey guys, usually on 1 adset on CBO how many creatives you guys put max? 

We can put 10-15 on same adset or better to create multiple adset?
[4.09.25, 16:40:25] ~ Joel Cederlund: Idk was long time ago but was some setting. Said my tracking and attribution have been way off. Don’t know if it helped or not but meta rep told me it would
[4.09.25, 16:40:53] ~ Errol: Same with us…lol
[4.09.25, 16:57:25] ~ Filippo: Did you set up the Meta CAPI with the default facebook app on shopify?
[4.09.25, 16:58:18] ~ Al: yep
[4.09.25, 16:58:52] ~ Filippo: And you saw better performance and also better tracking?
[4.09.25, 17:01:51] ~ Al: yep we'd been using meta capi for 3 years on the brand so lots of data. We switched to wetracked because we're launching new products and I was afraid meta would mess attribution, but then I have no way to know how tf wetracked is better, and our performance was worse. So no point
[4.09.25, 17:02:16] ~ Al: we have a super consolidated meta account btw which keeps it all very easy to track. 1 product 1 campaign
[4.09.25, 17:02:37] ~ Filippo: Makes sense thanks
[4.09.25, 17:30:28] ~ Adam K.: Has anyone used more than 2 ad accounts for one site/brand? I’m curious about performance—did results stay consistent, or did you notice changes after adding another account?
[4.09.25, 17:37:25] ~ Shri Kanase: Hey everyone. I have a very good product researcher / description writer who’s just opened up for some work.

[4.09.25, 17:45:47] ~ Ben Mansour: If you are targeting the same audience with 2 accounts, it can cause fluctuations
[4.09.25, 17:46:05] ~ Ben Mansour: But if the 2 audiences are different, it won‘t affect

[5.09.25, 11:59:22] ~ Tom: Thanks for sharing!!
[5.09.25, 12:07:41] ~ RS: Is there anybody who use only manual bid campaigns for scaling?
[5.09.25, 13:45:21] ~ 🥇: Hello guys, Is there a good way to open a bank account in Dubai without residency—mainly just to hold funds? I’m fine with going there in person to sign the documents. If anyone has done this before, I’d appreciate your recommendations on which banks are best and what the process looks like.
[5.09.25, 13:54:41] ~ Zsombor: Why don't you want residency? If you plan to go there anyways.
[5.09.25, 13:55:15] ~ Zsombor: I think you can only open a non resident savings account without cards etc.. so limited in functionality
[5.09.25, 13:57:21] ~ 🥇: I don’t mind residency itself, I just meant I don’t want to be required to actually live in Dubai for a minimum months each year. I’d like to keep an account just to hold funds without having to maintain physical presence.
[5.09.25, 13:58:23] ~ RakanGammoh: Hello bro, from what you’ll find online, it looks possible. But from my own experience, every bank ends up asking for an Emirates ID and a UAE number (which later gets linked to your Emirates ID anyway). I’m not sure if there are any real workarounds maybe saving account is possible, but honestly, it won’t be easy going down that path. There are plenty of good banks, but the one I’ve seen as the most straightforward without any  track record in the UAE is RAKBANK.
[5.09.25, 13:59:11] ~ RakanGammoh: Hope that helps
[5.09.25, 14:00:59] ~ Zsombor: You don't have to live there to be a resident. Just need to visit every 6 months. It's a very nice place in my opinion so that shouldn't be an issue either. I think having an Emirates ID is the optimal way to do it if you plan long term.
[5.09.25, 14:01:27] ~ RakanGammoh: You only need to visit once every six months. If you’ve got extra cash, you could go for the Golden Residency Visa but it’s worth asking about the details first.
[5.09.25, 14:06:35] ~ 🥇: Yes, I’ve been there and I also plan to move there maybe end of next year, but at the moment I can’t. I just want to make sure the account setup doesn’t require me to stay for a minimum number of months per year. Regarding residency, do you know how long it takes and if i’d need to be go there to apply?
[5.09.25, 14:10:19] ~ RakanGammoh: There are plenty of agencies that can help with this, but in the end you’ll still need to go and stay for about a month to complete the medical test, residency process, and open the bank account. Agencies can support you with these steps too, but worst-case scenario, plan for a month.
[5.09.25, 14:12:23] ~ Phil: So you only have to visit once every six months to be classified as a resident?? And this goes for paying no income tax etc?
[5.09.25, 14:14:50] ~ RakanGammoh: Yes, just one visit every six months, and there’s no income tax. But if you set up a company, keep in mind there’s still a 9% corporate tax.
[5.09.25, 14:15:29] ~ Phil: Okay nice. That’s good to know thanks
[5.09.25, 14:16:12] ~ 🥇: Thanks, that’s helpful. Do you know any good agency you’d recommend for handling that?
[5.09.25, 14:19:38] ~ RakanGammoh: Honestly, I don’t know any trusted ones. I hired someone 2 years ago, paid them, and still ended up doing the whole process myself 🙃
So be careful from this
[5.09.25, 14:19:39] ~ Zsombor: I can recommend the guy I did it with recently if that helps. It took us 2 weeks.
[5.09.25, 14:21:50] ~ 🥇: Ahh thank you for lmk , btw you just opened personal bank right ?
[5.09.25, 14:22:25] ~ 🥇: Yes it would be great
[5.09.25, 14:22:31] ~ Alvaro De Prada: No. You need to enter once every six months to keep your residency active. But you are not considered a resident unless you spend 183+ days a year
[5.09.25, 14:23:50] ~ RakanGammoh: Corporate first, then personal afterwards.
[5.09.25, 14:29:17] ~ 🥇: Okay bro thanks really appreciate your infos
[5.09.25, 14:30:42] ~ RakanGammoh: You’re most welcome! Feel free to DM me if you need more details
[5.09.25, 15:14:38] ~ OB: Hey guys can anyone recommend a Shopify dev

[5.09.25, 20:21:38] ~ m: im q sure tht if u put like 1m AED into a mashreq account u can do this. get a gold account.
[5.09.25, 20:40:14] ~ Mason Schulze: Too bad you cant process payments through UAE with shopify
[5.09.25, 20:42:01] ~ RakanGammoh: You need to use Stripe it's  available there
[5.09.25, 20:44:37] ~ RakanGammoh: Shopify Payments isn’t available, but Shopify actually uses Stripe internally
[5.09.25, 20:45:00] ~ Mason Schulze: ‎This message was deleted.
[5.09.25, 20:45:02] ~ Mason Schulze: To just switch
[5.09.25, 20:45:29] ~ Mason Schulze: If starting very small would be no issue
[5.09.25, 20:45:56] ~ RakanGammoh: Srtipe is risky , but you have other options when you scale and all are available in UAE now especially since 2024
[5.09.25, 20:46:51] ~ Mason Schulze: Know of any others?
[5.09.25, 20:47:06] ~ Mason Schulze: That can just switch and accept that amount straight away
[5.09.25, 20:48:53] ~ RakanGammoh: Selling to big 4 ??
[5.09.25, 20:49:05] ~ Mason Schulze: Yep
[5.09.25, 20:50:36] ~ RakanGammoh: 2Checkout
[5.09.25, 20:50:48] ~ RakanGammoh: if you have volume, they will accept you
[5.09.25, 20:51:31] ~ RakanGammoh: checkout.com
[5.09.25, 20:51:42] ~ Mason Schulze: Ahh yes
[5.09.25, 20:51:53] ~ Mason Schulze: Thanks bro, will check it out
[5.09.25, 20:52:02] ~ RakanGammoh: You Welcome
[5.09.25, 22:06:50] ~ Yuanda: Anyone have connects to exotic rentals in Italy? Porsche
[6.09.25, 13:18:55] ~ Faruk Ilkhan: ‎Faruk Ilkhan joined using a group link.
[6.09.25, 9:18:00] ~ -J: Check dm
[6.09.25, 15:59:57] ~ Nils: hey guys! anyone know of blackhat service that shadowbans someone on linkedin?
[6.09.25, 16:01:02] ~ Elad daskal: Anyone else seeing weird pacing on FB the last few days in the US?
[6.09.25, 16:01:25] ~ m: guys anyone with an insider at amazon? someone using my trademark to sell their shit with our brand on it. pls lmk thanks
[6.09.25, 16:09:00] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Anybody advertising to women's over 45+ menopause USA?

Whatever I do I don't get my CPMs below 200$, the best was literally 170$. This is very pissing off and yes I have tried swapping each of assets thinking it might be flagged, the last thing I can do is pixel.

Please advise.
[6.09.25, 16:12:56] ~ Ben Mansour: I guess you just started advertising
[6.09.25, 16:13:00] ~ Ben Mansour: Just keep spending
[6.09.25, 16:13:05] ~ Ben Mansour: It will get lower with time
[6.09.25, 16:13:31] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: i am doing this for over 20 days
[6.09.25, 16:14:09] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: i get winner ads and i do get profitable ngl but this is pissing me off if cpms get to even 100$ we can do a lot better overall
[6.09.25, 16:14:24] ~ Ben Mansour: Just keep spending and adding more creatives
[6.09.25, 16:14:42] ~ Ben Mansour: It happened to us before, that‘s what we did
[6.09.25, 16:14:51] ~ Ben Mansour: As you scale budget it will eventually get lower
[6.09.25, 16:15:02] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: any recommendation, i have a last few things to test those "just cause as a image ad on white listed page with story telling" and my hopes are with that.
[6.09.25, 16:15:34] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: hmm, at how much weekly new ads u r pushing into ur ad account bro?
[6.09.25, 16:16:02] ~ Ben Mansour: At that time was like 3-5
[6.09.25, 16:16:27] ~ Steve: You need better creative for sure, this is a hyper saturated niche, products are popping off in that niche, Menopause over 45+ is a HOT category pretty much everywhere so the competition is thick
[6.09.25, 16:16:55] ~ Steve: tossing up any creative you can and then getting pissed your CPMs are high isn’t going to help you. Yes, getting new creatives and iterating is important
[6.09.25, 16:17:08] ~ Steve: but you’re probably competeting against some absolute killers for your customer
[6.09.25, 16:17:27] ~ Steve: so you need way stronger creatives. Tough niche. It CAN be done because its such a hot niche, you just need stronger creative
[6.09.25, 16:20:06] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: What do you recommend to focus majorly on bro?
Well I did some celebrity ads and they scaled very quick and good but it's harder to find winners and then it gets me down to nearly zero.

Do you suggest more digging into sub avatars and find a sweet spot or?
[6.09.25, 16:21:04] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Absolutely right bro, i see biggest of biggest brands like BB company, some of the primal queen and other brands advertising it.
[6.09.25, 16:22:15] ~ Steve: gotta do the deep research, find other pockets of customers they’re not hitting, or find new ways to approach the ones they are. Its a short answer to a very long question haha
[6.09.25, 16:22:48] ~ Steve: if I had the answer to do it every time I’d be retired by now
[6.09.25, 16:23:29] ~ Steve: start testing new avatars, watch the data, find new creative ways to attract them and move fast. your advantage is you can be super agressive and super quick
[6.09.25, 16:25:08] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Got you brother, thanks for the advice 🙏
[6.09.25, 17:04:29] ~ Filippo: whos got a killer for product-mechanism animations?
‎[6.09.25, 18:04:36] ~ Ben Mansour: ‎Contact card omitted
[6.09.25, 20:18:33] ~ Brett Fallarino: Yeah. It’ll sort itself out in a few days / weeks I believe. Meta has been making tons of updates (Always happens before Q4 in my experience)
[7.09.25, 4:54:09] ~ Antonio Celani: Hello guys I have 120k EUR on hold in shopify payments accounts

Selling digital products total white brands.
[7.09.25, 4:54:19] ~ Antonio Celani: Do you have someone who can help me ? I give good commission
[7.09.25, 11:23:56] ~ Filippo: hey guys what are your thoughts on pre-orders for consumable products?
[7.09.25, 11:25:26] ~ Monaesh: We’ve done it and it’s totally fine. As long as you communicate to customers
[7.09.25, 11:25:58] ~ Filippo: how did it affect roas and how far was the delivery date?
[7.09.25, 11:26:53] ~ Filippo: and i guess you framed it as “2nd launch” since for consumable especially you need previous reviews…doubt people would buy the first release of a “miracle product” without seeing reviews
[7.09.25, 11:37:26] ~ Monaesh: We ran as upsell not front end offer but take rate was good.
[7.09.25, 11:37:43] ~ Monaesh: No we didn’t just said small one time batch only.
[7.09.25, 11:39:38] ~ Steve: You can also put right below your Buy Button and on your checkout “Stock Delays: Product May Take 14-18 days to ship”

Even larger brands like Gundry MD do this - We’ve seen it ironically increase conversion because it signals “low stock buy now” etc
[7.09.25, 11:40:20] ~ Steve: and also, sets the expectation this might take a while to get there, and as long as you communicate in that window to the customer you should be fine - you’ll still get pissed off people because you’ll always get pissed off people, but can help to mitigate refund requests
[7.09.25, 11:52:45] ~ Mithiran: hey guys what is the typical pick and pack fees for USA 3pls?
[7.09.25, 13:38:32] ~ Elad daskal: Does anybody know an easy solution to scrape fb and IG post comments? App/extension/ai anything?
[7.09.25, 14:38:18] ~ Steve: https://exportcomments.com/
[7.09.25, 14:38:37] ~ Steve: i use this its free. drop in ad link (make sure its the link that shows comments)
[7.09.25, 14:38:49] ~ Elad daskal: Awesome. Tnx man 👌
[7.09.25, 14:38:49] ~ Steve: export as CSV if you’re looking to use GPT to analyze
[7.09.25, 14:39:05] ~ Steve: im sure theres better paid ones, but this is free, works fine for me
[7.09.25, 14:42:12] ~ Elad daskal: Not against free stuff 😏
[7.09.25, 15:06:01] ~ Damiano: Hey guys, how can I add a friend to this group?
[7.09.25, 15:34:40] ~ N: Who comes up with what hooks and leads you should test?
[7.09.25, 16:15:18] ~ Ben Mansour: Send a message to one of the admins
[7.09.25, 16:16:08] ~ Ben Mansour: founder, copywriter or creative strategist
[7.09.25, 19:30:45] ~ Arian: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added Arian
[7.09.25, 16:32:31] ~ Damiano: I’ve already texted @⁨~Lucio Martinez⁩
[7.09.25, 16:53:55] ~ Mason Schulze: For those generating AI image ads on GPT how are you prompting it to make the correct size?
[7.09.25, 17:13:53] ~ Steve: use Gemini
[7.09.25, 17:14:08] ~ Steve: and then just give it the size of image you want
[7.09.25, 17:14:24] ~ Steve: i cant stress enough how much better Gemini’s new image gen is than GPT, night and day
[7.09.25, 17:15:15] ~ N: How do u guy us go about finding new offers to test
[7.09.25, 17:15:22] ~ N: Besides gethookd
[7.09.25, 17:49:32] ~ Mason Schulze: Thanks boss
[7.09.25, 17:59:59] ~ Monaesh: 100% use gemini
[7.09.25, 18:00:13] ~ Monaesh: Even the video on there is so much better
[7.09.25, 18:03:49] ~ Emanuel Sabelsjö: Hey guys, I have a friend that won’t get his PayPal transfers out. Anyone got a plug that can help get it released? Send me a DM
[7.09.25, 19:49:44] ~ Omar: whats eeryones strike rate of finding winning new products
[7.09.25, 19:51:24] ~ m: I heard it’s hard nowadays
[7.09.25, 19:53:39] ~ Molka Sghaier: 🥲..
[7.09.25, 19:53:53] ~ Omar: the market getting hard
[7.09.25, 19:55:34] ~ Fabian: Same
[7.09.25, 19:56:39] ~ m: Does it get like this now n then. Or is it just overall harder
[7.09.25, 19:57:25] ~ Fabian: Some experience harch periods  but often gets better
[7.09.25, 19:57:47] ~ Fabian: Especially if you sell period products , it’s the end of summer. Really nothing to sell then
[7.09.25, 19:58:06] ~ m: Evergreen is the focus
[7.09.25, 19:58:38] ~ Ben Mansour: The market is full of tt shop stuff now
[7.09.25, 19:59:03] ~ m: Yeh true. Temu expanding fast too. Hitting UK hard as we speak
[7.09.25, 19:59:18] ~ Ben Mansour: Some keywords i used to use in ad library for product research that showed 4-10k results before, now they show +50k ads
[7.09.25, 19:59:22] ~ Ben Mansour: And it‘s all kalodata stuff
[7.09.25, 20:01:02] ~ Adonis A: Wow That’s insane
[7.09.25, 20:03:11] ~ Fabian: what time period?
[7.09.25, 20:17:38] ~ Ben Mansour: Like 3-4 months ago
[7.09.25, 20:20:03] ~ Mithiran: Anyone know of a good 3PL in texas?
[7.09.25, 20:20:07] ~ Mithiran: in the middle of USA
[7.09.25, 20:20:21] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes
[7.09.25, 20:31:20] ~ Yusuf: Can anyone help remove negative Trustpilot reviews? (Germany)
[7.09.25, 21:27:13] ~ Mo: Just started working with one guy. He’s great. Let me know if u need his contact
[7.09.25, 23:55:43] ~ M: does anyone have a group buy for minea?
[8.09.25, 4:46:17] ~ m: Hi there
[8.09.25, 11:06:36] ~ Filippo: anyone split tested AI spokeperson VS actor?
[8.09.25, 11:45:40] ~ Monaesh: Any one else seeing a huge rise in Meta CPMs this month?
[8.09.25, 11:54:03] ~ RS: Im seeing a huge drop in CPM. Like 50% lower CPM. But cannot say that traffic is that good
[8.09.25, 12:22:51] ~ Monaesh: US markets?
[8.09.25, 12:23:21] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Happened to me too. Cpm and cpc crashed
[8.09.25, 12:23:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: CVr crashed as well
[8.09.25, 12:23:37] ~ Alvaro De Prada: From 3.4% cvr to 1.2ish
[8.09.25, 12:23:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Ctr increased
[8.09.25, 12:25:25] ~ Steve: So we had this last half of august
[8.09.25, 12:26:07] ~ Steve: 50% decline in CPMs, 60% decline in CTR, AOV stayed steady, CPCs steady. CVR steady.

All data pointed to shitty traffic
[8.09.25, 12:26:40] ~ Steve: It was also august, so people are ein vacation, advertisers pull back cpms drop and meta serves you to shit customers. Particularly in health this is a yearly trend
[8.09.25, 12:27:11] ~ Steve: But as of labor day everything flipped our CPMs skyrocketed, CTR climbed back up. So was a signal that buyer interest was back and we had killer labor day week
[8.09.25, 12:27:27] ~ Steve: But all our labor day shit majorly tanked this past weekend so we finally cut it
[8.09.25, 12:27:50] ~ Steve: Which is normal after a sale period and now customer behaviors settle back in. This is also back to school week for americans
[8.09.25, 12:28:00] ~ Steve: Mom and dad are busy right now lol
[8.09.25, 12:28:57] ~ Gideon: Is 6700 euro monthly reasonable for CRO traject with 14 tests monthly to improve cro of my Shopify store? Sounds high but not sure what’s normal
[8.09.25, 12:29:18] ~ Monaesh: Yea good point. We’re just going to ride it out
[8.09.25, 12:30:56] ~ Monaesh: Some people have mentioned this https://x.com/CTtheDisrupter/status/1952376939534319911


but not sure how much of a factor this is playin
[8.09.25, 12:34:01] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Been there done that. Waste of money in my opinion if you do direct response marketing. Biggest CRO lever is Creative + landing page congruence
[8.09.25, 12:35:11] ~ Alvaro De Prada: That “monthly increase in revenue due to CRO” goes to shit if your ad dies
[8.09.25, 12:38:29] ~ Gideon: Okay thanks. It sounds great indeed. What’s your best practice then to improve conversion rate?
[8.09.25, 12:39:36] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Creative + landing page congruence. 

Also depends the type of brand you are running but if you have killer creatives, create landing pages that are based on what the creative talks about and you’ll see an increase in cvr
[8.09.25, 12:40:35] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can also test shipping thresholds, shipping prices and offers to get a better CVR or worse CVR. But is all about profit per visitor
[8.09.25, 12:41:09] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can have a 100% CVR if you sell real Rolex at 99% below market value, but you are bleeding money
[8.09.25, 12:42:31] ~ Alvaro De Prada: In my opinion, unless you have a brand that gets a ton of organic traffic due to brand recognition. Those 6.7k a month can be spent better in creatives, creative strategists, content ecc and you’ll get a better result
[8.09.25, 13:19:37] ~ Rick: If you had a 20k company budget to choose various agencies and/or mentors, what would you prioritise? I already have a Google agency, in-house email marketing and creative . ‎<This message was edited>
[8.09.25, 13:22:06] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Depends on what you are lacking, where you are and where you want to be
[8.09.25, 13:23:26] ~ Rick: 4ML year, i want to reach 10ML, lacking on covering the stagionality of my main product
[8.09.25, 13:25:00] ~ Rick: in your experience which one gave you the most leverage?
[8.09.25, 13:31:25] ~ Steve: Getting ads made and iterating on them quickly.
I wont give you our exact OPEX but it’s below 40k/mo

We have:
- Agency that handles 60 VSLs per week (3 new concepts, 4 iterations of each concept, 5 SS for each iteration = 60)
- ⁠Internally 1 video editor, 1 great graphic designer, 1 full stack dev. We do our own internal VSLs, advertorial pages, build everything in shopify or Replo, but have ability to do other stuff.
- ⁠Media Buyer + CS Lead (Obvious what they do)
- ⁠CMO/Creative Strategist/Copywriter = Me
- ⁠CEO/COO/Product Dev = My partner
- ⁠Part time financial VA.
- ⁠Google Agency
- ⁠Amazon Agency
- ⁠Tiktok Agency

imo, this is really all you need to get to multiple M’s on the year, even more if you really push.

We’ve had some insane struggles in first 12 full months but still did 7 figures

Projections are we could target $10m in total rev in year 2

but i dont give too much of a shit about that, our whole focus now is on way better and more consistent contribution margins.

you learn quick that monthly revenue numbers is just vanity metric. Profit all that matters
[8.09.25, 13:32:55] ~ Rick: My man Steve
[8.09.25, 13:32:56] ~ Rick: Thanks 🙏🏽
[8.09.25, 13:33:00] ~ Steve: oh should mention - AI is a big part of this. if you’re not investing heavily in AI and AI agents, NGMI in my oppinion
[8.09.25, 13:33:18] ~ Steve: AI has allowed us to keep our OPEX insanely low and thats going to be the trend going forward.
[8.09.25, 15:45:33] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Great response. We are at a 10M run rate this year and don’t have half of what you are saying, so easy you could blast it with that team. 

I’d invest in everything creatives/landing pages and understanding the limits of your products and how you can push them to improve upon them. 

But what is going to give you the most leverage to scale is creatives and landings, so I’d focus only on that until I’m hitting millions per month
[8.09.25, 15:47:32] ~ Rick: and for the internal team, do you provide ongoing training for them, or do you hire people who already have experience and skills?
[8.09.25, 15:47:38] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If your product has seasons, you need to work your ass off to be ready for your prime. You could find other products that sell well during off season that make sense for your brand (swimsuits/underwear) but other than that is testing like crazy so when is your time to shine, you only need to up the budgets
[8.09.25, 15:48:00] ~ Rick: yes you right
[8.09.25, 15:48:08] ~ Alvaro De Prada: The people that take you from 0 to 1 won’t take you from 1 to 10
[8.09.25, 15:48:16] ~ OB: hey guys, any recommendation for email expert?
[8.09.25, 15:49:02] ~ Alvaro De Prada: We have team members that we trained from nothing and hit a ceiling or fucked us over… now we hire people that are ready or better than we are
[8.09.25, 15:49:27] ~ Rick: for now i have the same people that take me from 1 to 100 and from 100 to 4ML year
[8.09.25, 15:49:32] ~ Rick: ok nice to know
[8.09.25, 15:51:12] ~ Filippo: When it comes to AI creatives I noticed many peoole don’t necessarily hire people already good with AI- they provide workshops
[8.09.25, 15:51:32] ~ Filippo: I guess for certain roles you have to provide some sort of training
[8.09.25, 15:54:20] ~ Pramesh: can anyone recommend solid trustpilot review plug?
[8.09.25, 15:55:25] ~ Giorgos: Its impossible to not train them, especially when hiring affordable
[8.09.25, 15:57:35] ~ Rick: follow ‎<This message was edited>
[8.09.25, 16:03:31] ~ N: Are you doing supplements ?
[8.09.25, 16:03:56] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Nope. Beauty
[8.09.25, 16:04:08] ~ N: In USA?
[8.09.25, 16:04:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: WW but USA 60%
[8.09.25, 16:05:18] ~ N: Would u say u need 80% gross margin to survive fb ads rn
[8.09.25, 16:06:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Depends, but the more the better, but very difficult to get to 80%
[8.09.25, 16:20:58] ~ Ben Mansour: Doesn‘t matter at all, even 60% you can be fine
[8.09.25, 17:08:58] ~ Matt: Does anyone have any good resources to calculate LTV if you have multiple supply variation options such as 1/2/3 month options? The software reports don’t seem to calculate it accurately from what I can see
[8.09.25, 19:17:10] ~ Austin: Does anyone know how to integrate wetracked with checkout champ?
[8.09.25, 20:17:04] ~ Bryan T: Anyone have metrics for how effective calling abandoned checkouts is? I assume doing this is a no brainer?
[8.09.25, 20:22:16] ~ Shri Kanase: You can expect a 3% or so conversion rate, very effective
[8.09.25, 22:03:56] ~ Adam Radwan: Anyone knows an alternative to paywithextend.com? Need a virtual card for my amex not sure why paywithextend is not working
[8.09.25, 22:05:32] Alex  Fedotoff: we use dash.fi and Flex for virtual cards those are solid options
[8.09.25, 22:30:02] ~ Charles: Do they truly have 3% cash back?
[9.09.25, 9:38:41] ~ Mo: guys looking for a control/tracking software for my employees ( sth like upwork ) where i can see what they are spending time on. This is the main reason, i want to see what they are doing. ive tried other tools but none offer this.
[9.09.25, 10:39:28] ~ Elad daskal: Does anyone have a good flow (and mind sharing it) for writing VSL copy using AI?
[9.09.25, 10:41:30] ~ Molka Sghaier: Insightful
[9.09.25, 11:16:47] ~ Giorgos: Oh..  you getting down a bad route buddy. 

Remember when i was an employee someone used hubstaff. And believe me I've done a bunch  of funny shit to trick it.

Culture and performance incentives is the game
‎[9.09.25, 11:18:43] ~ Giorgos: ‎image omitted
[9.09.25, 11:21:08] ~ Mo: u definitely got this @⁨~Giorgos⁩, i agree 100% . so ud recommend not using it at all ?  i believe that it should be a healthy mix of both( investing more in culiture, perf while maintaining control)

when testing new employees ( low level) i always do this, but then when i pick the A players that I can trust. i pull them out of these tracking apps. ‎<This message was edited>
[9.09.25, 11:32:13] ~ Giorgos: I just care for the results. If someone can do the work that brings the results that meet my expectations for that person, as described to him. Then i dont care if they're doing it in 5min or 5days
[9.09.25, 11:34:19] ~ Giorgos: If someone is lazy and that shows up in their results. It's 1, 2, go. Cause even with a screen tracker, they'd still shortcut you ‎<This message was edited>
[9.09.25, 11:38:21] ~ Alvaro De Prada: We use it but don’t check often. Just once a month we check if there is something wrong. We use hubstaff. We’ve caught some working two jobs while being in the clock
[9.09.25, 11:41:11] ~ Monaesh: Heygen
[9.09.25, 12:04:10] ~ Molka Sghaier: insightful is made so that u cant use any tricks on it xd and tbh the teams performance including mine is at its best when we all know that were tracking in insightful
[9.09.25, 12:04:44] ~ Molka Sghaier: and actually we caught 2 employees stealing (overcharging hours )
[9.09.25, 12:05:51] ~ Molka Sghaier: You can’t manage what you can’t measure
[9.09.25, 12:11:21] ~ Molka Sghaier: i care xd because if he can do great results in 1 day why would he waste 4 more days ? its a game of quality AND SPEED not only quality .. and as u said culture incentives is the game and idk bout yall but i dont want anyone thats lazy or wants to “trick” the system to gain more money and not work as hard as he should in my team, it ruins the culture
[9.09.25, 12:14:29] ~ Gord JB: Ye mate - worked with a consultant for over 1 year
Fair price at $2k a month & they structure the flows too

Dm me
[9.09.25, 12:14:55] Topi: This convo was just going on here like 2 weeks ago

Yes, you can use hubstaff if it suits your situation 

@⁨~Mo⁩ just do what makes sense for your specific needs, thats the name of the game
[9.09.25, 12:15:16] ~ Yusuf: We just use Hubstaff and it worked great so far. Our Incentivisation is that they get assigned more work if they do a good job. So they’re basically in competition with the other editors.
[9.09.25, 12:20:03] ~ Giorgos: Expectations are set in stone. I wouldn't pay someone delivering a days work in 5. Nor one that compromise on quality because they lazy. Ι cant play hide and seek. You do what you're supposed. Ok? Good. No? Bye
[9.09.25, 12:21:43] ~ Molka Sghaier: its not personal chill😅
[9.09.25, 12:24:05] ~ Alexander Sundström: For you that used trustpilot services for reviews, have you gotten problems with trustpilot?
[9.09.25, 12:24:57] ~ Matt: Any good recs for a Philippine recruitment agency for ecom? Vetted applicants etc
[9.09.25, 12:43:14] ~ UHO: Are they performing? Are you seeing results?

What if you just have trust issues? Sometimes, we founders do not realize early that we are the problem.
[9.09.25, 12:48:39] ~ UHO: At the end of the day, results are all that matter, totally agree with you @⁨~Giorgos⁩.

With AI on the rise, big employers that pay staff huge chunks every month are encouraging them to use AI and investing in company-wide AI systems to save as much time as possible and reduce burnout, I'm not sure why the case is always opposite when it involves employers who will pay less, they want you to work your ass out for every penny they wanna offer.
[9.09.25, 12:50:22] ~ OB: control the results not the work
[9.09.25, 12:55:41] ~ Mithiran: does anyone know of a way to take a current english video and translate to a different language and the mouth movement will match
[9.09.25, 13:01:48] ~ UHO: HeyGen and Dubly.AI are the easiest to use, just upload your video and get a lip-synced translation in minutes. For higher-quality or professional use, LipDub AI and ElevenLabs Dubbing Studio deliver more realistic results that preserve tone and emotion. If you’re working on longer videos or multiple speakers, Rask.ai or Vozo.ai are better suited.
[9.09.25, 13:28:53] ~ Fabian: In this case, why not pay employee per “result” instead of hours?
[9.09.25, 13:29:14] ~ Filippo: When you hire a new employee, do you have him sign an NDA contract or something similar?
[9.09.25, 13:37:16] ~ UHO: lol. I never pay per hour, each employee has a base pay, paid per month, regardless of how many hours they work, etc.

It’s an agreement between us and them, stated in the contract.
[9.09.25, 13:38:03] ~ Fabian: No minimum hours per month then? Just some sort of minimum outcome?
[9.09.25, 13:52:40] ~ UHO: Global standard 40 hours per week.

Considering the “9 - 5”.
[9.09.25, 14:01:17] ~ OB: De minimis exemption now gone worldwide; after August 29, 2025, no e-commerce business shipping from overseas into the U.S. is exempt anymore, no matter the order value or country of origin.
[9.09.25, 14:01:53] ~ OB: our customers are getting hit with customs duty charges and the packages are not shipped from China
[9.09.25, 14:02:05] ~ m: yes nda
[9.09.25, 14:03:48] ~ Monaesh: What shipping lines are you using?
[9.09.25, 14:05:41] ~ OB: DHL

[9.09.25, 14:37:54] ~ Davide: Anyone tried AI podcasts with heygen?
[9.09.25, 14:40:57] ~ Giorgos: I see them out in the wild for a lil while
[9.09.25, 14:41:01] ~ Giorgos: Must be working

[9.09.25, 21:07:19] ~ Monaesh: What’s the difference between these and clarity ?
[9.09.25, 21:07:43] ~ Kostić: they are like more for ecom i think
[9.09.25, 21:07:47] ~ Kostić: specifically
[9.09.25, 21:13:01] ~ M: We use it too
[9.09.25, 22:32:42] ~ Matt: Anyone running 6-7figs per month via native ads?

[11.09.25, 12:40:43] ~ UHO: Looking forward to speaking in one of these meet ups someday. I’ve got a lot of proven tips and tricks up my sleeves. Until then, can’t wait to attend! ❤️
[11.09.25, 12:59:40] ~ Matthew Martorano: We have solid stats that show a rapid decline in chargebacks when orders and upsells are bundled in a single transaction. One brand owner said it reduced his chargebacks by more than two thirds.
[11.09.25, 13:00:58] ~ Mithiran: Does it affect anything with purchasing? How long it takes to load when u click buy
[11.09.25, 13:02:57] ~ Matthew Martorano: It auths the first trans and keeps adding sales on every click in the upsells path then finalized the auth at the thank you page or after the session terminates.
[11.09.25, 13:25:26] ~ Joel Cederlund: anyone know how process will go if I wanna sell my store with Meta,Google account etc?
[11.09.25, 14:01:20] ~ Matthew Martorano: I haven’t looked at the data, but I would assume you’ll see an uptick in approvals. Ask your AM how to set it up properly.
[11.09.25, 14:35:45] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You transfer everything to the new buyer
[11.09.25, 14:59:03] ~ Mike Kasdorf: DM me. I've done it a few times.
[11.09.25, 14:59:48] ~ RS: Hey! Guys who use funnelish, what meta tracking software do you use? I use wetracked but it counts every upsell as seperate purchase in FB so it always shows much lower CPA than it is actually.
[11.09.25, 15:58:54] ~ Michael: Guys, i try to link my WISE banking (US) to HK PayPal but it doesnt get accepted. „This account needs a little help to link it. Contact us and we can help with that, or you can link a different account.“ anyone knows how to fix it? I can either choose US or HK banking. usually US WISe should work i guess
[11.09.25, 15:59:29] ~ Mert M: dm bro
[11.09.25, 16:51:03] ~ Charles: Hey guys! Anyone is paying VAT to the UK? 20% taxes is crazy. And if the order is over 135 pounds it gets complicated quick. I got told by a friend he isnt charging taxes there because his agency told him it wasnt needed unless you live there. I'm kinda lost
[11.09.25, 16:51:32] ~ Charles: I’m from Canada btw
[11.09.25, 16:56:59] ~ David: vat is usually independent of where you live. If you to that country, you gotta pay sales tax / vat
[11.09.25, 16:56:59] ~ David: sell*
[11.09.25, 17:00:19] ~ Charles: Ive talked with a lot of big guy in the space and no ones charging them unless they live there…
[11.09.25, 17:00:43] ~ Charles: Doesnt mean it’s legal but man.. I kind of regret getting registered
[11.09.25, 17:31:25] ~ Filippo: anyone using AI images for before and afters? tips for editing?
[11.09.25, 17:39:28] ~ Mithiran: Does anyone here do consultation sales calls after someone purchases ? And also calling someone when they abandon cart. What kind of commission do you give?
[11.09.25, 17:48:21] ~ Mo: where u guys keep all ur brand assets ( content, media etc….) , sth that is easy to share with others too,  i use drive but its pain in the ass
[11.09.25, 18:04:53] ~ m: its to do with where the sales happens, so if ur selling to a uk person, its a yes
[11.09.25, 18:15:28] ~ Giorgos: Who got the best plug for forming LCC + EIN for non US residents.. DM me

[11.09.25, 18:16:11] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: it’s what i used they have good support
[11.09.25, 18:26:08] ~ Giorgos: how long before u got EIN in ur hands??
[11.09.25, 18:36:45] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: 40 days back in the day like 1.5 years ago
[11.09.25, 18:36:53] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: i think they’ve fastracked it now
[11.09.25, 18:37:17] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: they give you an LLC within a week, then EIN takes time
[11.09.25, 18:39:47] ~ Adam Radwan: Does anyone have a GOATED branding designer, tryna rebrand/redesign my supp
[11.09.25, 18:46:27] ~ Mithiran: stripe atlas it was like a week or two I got my EIN

[11.09.25, 19:00:26] ~ Kostić: budget 10-15k if someone got a rec
[11.09.25, 19:00:54] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Bro it's even less than a week like 4 days or something
[11.09.25, 19:01:13] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: EIN is so easy like i got a year prior and this was the case, I didn't pay for any priority too.
[11.09.25, 19:02:25] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: wa.me/privatily

Use their website to get one, until you have some document error it should be all sorted in a week very easily.
[11.09.25, 19:09:11] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: dm
[11.09.25, 19:09:32] ~ Kostić: us only

[11.09.25, 19:40:07] ~ Mo: did anyone experience a ban of fb/insta page because of a VA (social media manager) who logged in with a different IP ?
[11.09.25, 19:44:32] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Yeah brother that happens very often and easily, not even that but since I reside in india I have to turn on VPNs sometimes or proxies, if they detect there is a change they ask u selfie verifications, authentications, they log you out.
[11.09.25, 19:48:37] ~ Mo: Anyone found a workaround where ur VAs ( social media managers from Philippines…) can login to ur brand socials whitouht trigerring any security issues, bans or whatever
[11.09.25, 19:48:56] ~ Mo: Got it bro
[11.09.25, 19:51:33] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: They recently added a page access feature on Instagram too right? It was already on Facebook so that should work. I don't know about other socials.
[11.09.25, 19:51:42] ~ Erne: Login to your brands on a IP on multilogin and keep your accounts opened in there, just give them access to the multi login profile
[11.09.25, 20:04:55] ~ Loic: Hello guys, looking for a strong Shopify dev 🙌🏼

[12.09.25, 9:19:34] ~ Mo: best residential proxies guys ? ( with good price )
[12.09.25, 9:33:05] ~ Mo: for tasks like this ( social media content etc….) do i need residential proxies or just normal proxies ? bro can i dm brother ?
[12.09.25, 9:34:05] ~ -J: Myprivateproxy.net
[12.09.25, 9:35:09] ~ Mo: i use it already for my profiles. but my question is more for posting organic content and targeting a specific country, residential or just normal proxies
[12.09.25, 9:47:22] ~ Erne: Sure np
[12.09.25, 11:22:47] ~ Mo: anyone who knows someone who can help getting IG page verified ?
[12.09.25, 12:01:13] ~ Mikael: Anyone paying Facebook Invoicing from a different company than registered on the BM? Does it work?

[12.09.25, 13:06:55] ~ Loic: Hello, anyone has a great TikTok agency ad account provider?
[12.09.25, 13:10:37] ~ Davide: Hey, when do you work with creators, do you send them a specific contract to sign before starting? 
Things like whitelisting, usage rights, licensing etc? 
Any advice working with them?
[12.09.25, 13:32:42] ~ Davide: Do you negotiate with prices or do you have everything set up by default in the contract?
[12.09.25, 13:33:53] ~ m: anyone else got fb overspending like a mad man today
[12.09.25, 13:42:48] ~ Ry: Nope but performance was horrible today
[12.09.25, 14:52:51] ~ Ben Mansour: Do you recommend adjusting facebook campaigns budgets once every 3 days based on last 3 days results? I used to do it daily but i noticed that some campaigns have stable roas while others fluctuate a lot, like one day abot target roas and day after is way below ‎<This message was edited>
[12.09.25, 14:55:17] ~ Austin: Most the time we’re changing budgets at the 3 days + today metric
[12.09.25, 14:56:32] ~ Austin: Creators can be the easiest or most difficult to work with, I would 100% send contract and expectations
[12.09.25, 15:00:02] ~ Austin: And send them the most clear, detailed, example filled instructions for everything you want for less back and forth
[12.09.25, 15:02:16] ~ OB: Same here
[12.09.25, 15:04:57] ~ Ben Mansour: Together (4 days) or comparison?
[12.09.25, 16:59:11] ~ Mo: anyone tried to buy followers for his instagram page ( i know it hurts the acct, reach etc… but just for more trust when people check the brand on instagram, thats the only reason ), if anyone tried, what tool did u guys used , how did it go ? ‎<This message was edited>
[12.09.25, 17:11:17] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: justanotherpanel.com
[12.09.25, 17:11:18] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: For Buying Instagram Followers
[12.09.25, 17:11:21] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: heard this is good
[12.09.25, 17:19:57] ~ Mo: I’ll check it out thanks bro
[12.09.25, 17:36:59] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Is there a way to put Microsoft clarity on Shopify post purchase upsell/thank you page journey?
[12.09.25, 17:59:27] ~ Fabian: Yes but try buy some cheap first because some services is offline

Instead of buying thousands of likes directly

Test the service first
[12.09.25, 18:20:00] ~ Mo: Yes ofc i’ll start small, Have u tried it urself ?
[12.09.25, 18:24:48] ~ Fabian: Yes it’s good

[12.09.25, 18:45:46] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: This doesn't flag instagram?
[12.09.25, 18:45:58] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I used to use this while doing sparks at tiktok back in 2023
[12.09.25, 20:17:01] ~ Mo: i dont intend to use this with acct i run ads with
[12.09.25, 20:17:04] ~ Mo: so its fine
[12.09.25, 22:02:35] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: does anyone have a reference for closing a US LLC that can help with all the detailed headaches of closure, dissolution, federal tax, state tax etc. etc.
[12.09.25, 22:04:02] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: i was referenced to starcycle.ai
[12.09.25, 22:04:20] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: but theyre expensive they charge 300$ for all of it

[13.09.25, 1:19:30] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Right? I responded once to a post like this and the editor was trash.
[13.09.25, 1:21:41] ~ Yuanda: Anyone doing sms marketing with post script?
[13.09.25, 1:32:02] ~ Azedine: We are shifting to a new direction
[13.09.25, 3:51:49] ~ RS: Guys who use funnelish+wetracked, is FB tracking your purchases correctly? It stopped tracking anything for me in the last 10 hours. Wetracked says there is something wrong with funnelish. LOL
[13.09.25, 4:15:21] ~ Austin: I'm surf scaling for one for one of the first time ever.....Budgets are very high....I have to sleep in 4-5 hours...what do you do when sleeping? Just drop the spend back to a regular a day budget and start over in the AM?
[13.09.25, 4:27:42] ~ Adam Radwan: Just send it and keep the budget
[13.09.25, 4:28:11] ~ Adam Radwan: Either wake up to same performance, or -50% roas
[13.09.25, 4:29:01] ~ Austin: Ok fantastic
[13.09.25, 4:31:55] ~ Adam Radwan: I'm being serious, I swear to god I just leave it
[13.09.25, 4:32:25] ~ Adam Radwan: But if the budget is uncomfortably high reset the budget at midnight
[13.09.25, 4:33:14] ~ Austin: Oh I'm serious too, that budget gonna rip ‎<This message was edited>
[13.09.25, 5:11:52] ~ Gustavo Drumm: Every time I kept the budget it was absolute shit next day. I’m always resetting before midnight
[13.09.25, 7:02:26] ~ Phil: Hey guys, anyone have a good static creative person?
[13.09.25, 7:25:44] ~ Ry: same problem for me. @⁨~RS⁩
[13.09.25, 7:34:11] ~ Ry: on that note what are u guys using for funnelish tracking? wetracked support always sounds dodgy
[13.09.25, 7:43:43] ~ Jeb: How is everyone financially incentivising their media buyers based on profit? What’s the simplest and most trackable solution?
[13.09.25, 8:17:25] ~ David: Commission based on adspend at a fixed Roas.
[13.09.25, 11:06:07] ~ Shri Kanase: Create 3, 6, and 12 month roas and spend based goals. If they hit them, they get % of adspend based on spend amount
[13.09.25, 11:11:11] ~ Jeb: 🙏
[13.09.25, 11:25:28] ~ Gideon: What are the payment terms you use with suppliers to keep a good cash flow? Currently doing 30% at beginning of production and 70 when finished. Now doing bigger volumes. What are good and reasonable terms to negotiate for?
[13.09.25, 11:26:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: We do 15 days
[13.09.25, 11:27:09] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If I order stock, usually 15 days or more to pay it, shipping 1-15 and 16-30(31st)
[13.09.25, 11:27:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: This with our agent
[13.09.25, 11:37:59] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: Do 30% only before production but once goods are ready accept them in 4 weekly tranches or however based on your needs and pay in same tranches as well
[13.09.25, 11:38:57] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: After that once you build really good relations start getting stock on credit start with 15 day then 30 day credit.
[13.09.25, 12:18:44] ~ Matt: 20% deposit, 20% when goods are ready, 60% 30 days after goods leave port - we have worked with them for 2 years
[13.09.25, 12:21:08] ~ Filippo: do you manage to pay for stock with amex?
[13.09.25, 12:41:39] ~ Gideon: Okay. That’s a good idea.
[13.09.25, 12:59:23] ~ Mithiran: U can if u ask them to pay using ali pay but there’s a 3% fee
[13.09.25, 13:58:34] ~ Matt: Also you can ask them to get sinosure insurance and they will be much more likely to give better terms
[13.09.25, 14:02:13] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: googled it looks like an interesting concept, how does it work ?
[13.09.25, 14:34:30] ~ Matt: State backed trade insurance for Chinese suppliers
[13.09.25, 14:42:10] ~ Yusuf: We usually use Alipay with amex or if they accept paypal you can charge the transaction from your amex as well
[13.09.25, 14:43:12] ~ N: Has anyone done a good AI creative strategist course ?
[13.09.25, 15:35:54] ~ Steve: Am building one. A course for creative strategists. Will have lots of AI in it
[13.09.25, 15:35:54] ~ Steve: I expect to have it ready in a month or less. We want to hire creative strategists but I realized there's no good course for them to learn from experts. Want to build it and use it as a community to source from
[13.09.25, 15:35:55] ~ Steve: Been working on it for a little bit.
[13.09.25, 15:37:46] ~ Giorgos: sounds interesting.. curious to see how far you can go w it
[13.09.25, 15:38:58] ~ Steve: I see an opportunity because there's so many young creative people out there that don't realize how many businesses need this role filled at a high level. Businesses like ours
[13.09.25, 15:41:35] ~ David: Sounds interesting. Pls tag me when it’s ready 🙌
[13.09.25, 15:41:58] ~ Giorgos: 100%. an AI system, even operating at 60% of a persons capacity, will release super valuable headspace for the actual creative person
[13.09.25, 15:41:59] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: +1 me too, eagerly waiting for it.
[13.09.25, 15:54:51] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: Count me in for any community you build, also I am ready to heavily contribute as an ecommerce business owner with hands on experience in this. AI Copywriting, AI Research, AI Graphic Design etc. ‎<This message was edited>
[13.09.25, 15:54:51] ~ Simeon Petrov: +1 for me as well, that’s great
[13.09.25, 15:55:57] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: I think now steve needs to make that course 999$ only 😂😂 it got popular already
[13.09.25, 16:05:36] ~ Davide: you should take inspo and cover what missed from alex cooper, he released a course specifically on AI creative strategist
[13.09.25, 16:21:20] ~ Ben Mansour: Is it okay to name a facebook page something like Dr. fred anderson (or whatever) and advertise with it?
[13.09.25, 16:32:06] ~ Steve: Yeah saw that, want to build on it
[13.09.25, 16:32:17] ~ N: Is that the 2k course
[13.09.25, 16:32:29] ~ Steve: Thanks guys wasn't sure anyone would be interested but I think so!
[13.09.25, 16:45:29] ~ Davide: Yes with Jimmy
[13.09.25, 16:45:57] ~ Omar: im waiting for a ripped version of that course
[13.09.25, 16:45:58] ~ Omar: was it any good

[14.09.25, 5:03:47] ~ Adam Radwan: anyone got a good shopify plus checkout dev he can refer?
[14.09.25, 5:44:49] ~ Mithiran: hey guys what net profit (after all costs) should I be aiming for? Scale is 5-10m a year
[14.09.25, 10:14:20] ~ Omar: Does anyone know how to download videos from Amazon
[14.09.25, 10:15:33] ~ Adam Radwan: video downloadhelper chrome extension
[14.09.25, 11:33:02] ~ Tom: Anyone else experiencing weird spending patterns & meta performance for the past week or so?
[14.09.25, 11:37:01] ~ m: Yes
[14.09.25, 12:08:10] ~ Ry: There was like 3 outages past week
[14.09.25, 12:13:48] ~ Tom: We are experiencing higher cpms and the spending is very weird. 1h with very high spend and for the next few hours the spend is minimal
[14.09.25, 12:14:33] ~ RS: Good last 3 days for me and CPM below average
[14.09.25, 12:15:26] ~ Dawid: Same
[14.09.25, 12:16:04] ~ Dawid: I went from stable 4-5 x return on ads to to 2.5-3.5 and weird spending
[14.09.25, 12:27:38] ~ Tom: Exactly the same
[14.09.25, 12:28:04] ~ Tom: Trying to find a way for ongoing camps to return to normal spending. New camps dont have this problem
[14.09.25, 13:43:36] ~ Ben Mansour: Meta said that there will be some updates, so you may notice fluctuations in performance from now till the end of september
[14.09.25, 13:43:41] ~ Ben Mansour: After that it will be fine
[14.09.25, 13:44:14] ~ Dawid: What do you recommend , publish less ads keep for next month and lower ad spend until it’s better?
[14.09.25, 13:46:09] ~ Ben Mansour: maybe just try to keep it as it is for now
[14.09.25, 13:47:11] ~ Damiano: Hi guys, I just wrote to Shopify Payments to ask how I can change the company that receives payouts without having to change stores and create a new Shopify Payments account.

They told me that all I need to do is change the business details in the general settings and then change the bank account in Shopify Payments. Is it really that simple? Does anyone have experience with this? Thanks
[14.09.25, 13:48:32] ~ Ben Mansour: I did this before, and they enabled me to edit shopify payments company details
[14.09.25, 13:48:43] ~ Ben Mansour: but it took like 2 days, financial team has to allow that
[14.09.25, 13:49:48] ~ Damiano: Got it, thank you
[14.09.25, 14:33:59] ~ Filippo: Do you guys use onlinejobs free and google form? Cause last time i posted a job that way I got no candidates, wondering if it was shadowbanned or smth
[14.09.25, 15:12:55] ~ Ben Mansour: What‘s the best subscription app
[14.09.25, 15:13:10] ~ Ben Mansour: I‘ve heard about seal, skio, loop and recharge
[14.09.25, 15:26:12] ~ m: Loop for me. Recharge not good altho I’m stuck with it on one store. New store got loop. Easier to use. Just my opinion
[14.09.25, 18:36:02] Alex  Fedotoff: Loop is the best for
Us as well
[14.09.25, 18:39:45] ~ Mason Schulze: What platforms are you do you all recommend for customer support, gmail is getting unbearable and need some AI assistance also.
[14.09.25, 18:40:45] ~ Yusuf: Crisp is ok for the price but no crazy AI features imo
[14.09.25, 18:40:48] ~ Kostić: gorgias
[14.09.25, 18:42:51] ~ Yusuf: if you have good retention it makes sense to go closer to break even and scale with lower margins so you can acquire more NCs that pay out in the long term. If you rely on first purchase Profit I'd aim for around 25%
[14.09.25, 18:42:55] ~ Filippo: No one built AI agent for cs?
[14.09.25, 18:44:49] ~ m: im doing this rn, gnna b lovely, it will make a draft in ur inbox for u then ur CS person will check n send
[14.09.25, 18:45:23] ~ Filippo: cost effective?
[14.09.25, 18:45:39] ~ Filippo: heard N8N are actually expensive and not worth
[14.09.25, 18:45:46] ~ m: i mean im building ti in house, sorry, should hv said.

[14.09.25, 18:50:27] ~ Kostić: gorgias has it no?
[14.09.25, 18:59:11] ~ Al: Richpanel already does this
[14.09.25, 18:59:19] ~ Al: Richpanel
[14.09.25, 19:06:37] ~ Giuliano: Does someone has a great dev for coding work in the theme ? 

Would be great to get a good one ! Thx 🫡
[14.09.25, 19:20:07] ~ Filippo: How many CS reps you needed before and after using richpanel?
[14.09.25, 19:39:03] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I do 1.4M a month, have only 2 reps (not using richpanel). Average response time is 6 hours
[14.09.25, 19:39:56] ~ Alvaro De Prada: about 4000 emails per month
[14.09.25, 19:40:47] ~ Mason Schulze: @⁨~Alvaro De Prada⁩ are they philipeeno reps?
[14.09.25, 19:40:57] ~ Alvaro De Prada: yep
[14.09.25, 19:41:02] ~ Alvaro De Prada: one philip one US
[14.09.25, 19:41:20] ~ Mason Schulze: I have 5 with about 300 emails a day and they are breaking my bank and cant handle it
[14.09.25, 19:46:40] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: Bruu what scale you're at? You have a whole squad of CS reps
[14.09.25, 19:47:23] ~ Mason Schulze: Almost 3m a month
[14.09.25, 19:47:57] ~ Alvaro De Prada: How many hours do they work each?
[14.09.25, 19:48:22] ~ Mason Schulze: I dont know to be honest I think they are scamming me
[14.09.25, 19:48:30] ~ Alvaro De Prada: don't you track it?
[14.09.25, 19:48:37] ~ Mason Schulze: Problem with Gmail cant track them
[14.09.25, 19:48:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: you can, with hubstaff
[14.09.25, 19:48:52] ~ Alvaro De Prada: but... you shouldn't be using gmail at that scale
[14.09.25, 19:49:08] ~ Alvaro De Prada: reamaze, richpanel, commerceslayer will make the work much easier
[14.09.25, 19:50:45] ~ OB: Damn you re killing it bro, 100M year not that far!!!
[14.09.25, 19:51:44] ~ Ben Mansour: How much are you paying per month for cs?
[14.09.25, 19:55:02] ~ Filippo: any difference you see between the 2 reps?
[14.09.25, 20:05:25] ~ Mo: Reamaze does the job ( same job as gorgias for less)
[14.09.25, 20:15:19] ~ Mason Schulze: About 14k a month
[14.09.25, 20:15:22] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Bro gorgias hella expensive ngl gonna look into rich panel and intercom to lower overhead and invest more into better VAs and stronger team
[14.09.25, 20:39:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yeah, Philip would work 14 hours a day if I asked. US 8 and not a second more
[14.09.25, 20:41:29] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Damn. Almost 3k a month per employee. They must be insanely good for that amount 🥲
[14.09.25, 20:43:31] ~ alyas: I fired 90% of my cs team after figuring out how to improve productivity of 1 cs 10x with ai and automations
[14.09.25, 20:44:10] ~ alyas: Get 1 very good cs employee and learn him how to use ai and automations to handle all tickets
[14.09.25, 21:04:32] ~ Charles: Richpanel has their own AI
[14.09.25, 21:04:47] ~ Charles: Really cool and easy to use
[14.09.25, 21:04:57] ~ Charles: Will do a long way with only one CS ‎<This message was edited>
[14.09.25, 21:21:44] ~ Ben Mansour: Which cs software do you use?
[14.09.25, 21:22:19] ~ alyas: Re amaze
[14.09.25, 21:22:24] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: just through macros and AI agents?
[14.09.25, 21:22:40] ~ alyas: Yes
[14.09.25, 22:26:30] ~ Filippo: Sorry, what’s a “macro”?
[14.09.25, 22:28:36] ~ Al: They're taking the piss bro
[14.09.25, 22:29:29] ~ Al: Would def recommend switching to a software. We had Zendesk before and moved to Richpanel been there for a year it's been great. Gorgias is similar I hear just cooked expensive
[14.09.25, 22:31:05] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Pre-made text for common order inquiries
[14.09.25, 22:31:14] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: ur agent presses 2 buttons and boom email answered
[14.09.25, 22:31:21] ~ Al: We pay like ~$4k/m for 4 reps and 1 head of CS, we do around 1mm, and average first response time is <1h normally around 20mins. We already have it so we are a little overstaffed in case of swings
[14.09.25, 22:32:03] ~ Al: We have macros for everything and Richpanel also learns and suggests responses with AI etc but mostly we've built templates for literally any inquiry
[15.09.25, 7:23:31] ~ Mithiran: is richpanel a commonly used software or is it a newer smaller one
[15.09.25, 8:50:13] ~ Errol: Does reamaze have a limit on messages? Couldn’t tell by their pricing page
[15.09.25, 10:06:20] ~ Mo: I think they dont but double check with them to be 100% sure
[15.09.25, 11:15:31] ~ Davide: When you guys hire a new person like video editor/graphic designer, do you Meet their requests (split the payment, not being tracked…) or do you take the position no matter what?

[16.09.25, 3:35:09] ~ Steph: Re-marketing is super powerful on Google ads.

One of the main reasons being that you’ll have higher margins compared to normal ads, if they’ve bought from you before they’re more likely to buy again and your CPA will be lower.

Here’s an A-Z guide on remarketing for Google and how you can use it to boost your brand's revenue by 20-30% 👇

[16.09.25, 9:46:27] ~ m: Yes. But. Another Co owns the IP and it gave the Co that is selling on Amazon the brand registry permission-or what ever u call it. Also. In USA. Someone took my trademark temporarily. I’m in the process of getting it back. That’s the other complication that set all of this off.

[16.09.25, 23:58:39] ~ RS: Hey, is meta tracking working good for you now? Using funnelish+wetracked and no new purchases attributed for the last 4 hours
[17.09.25, 0:00:09] ~ Daniel: for me it’s the same, but I got the health & wellness flag so might be bc of that in my case
[17.09.25, 0:19:44] ~ Adam K.: wondering if its wetracked problem or people with for example triple whale have similar issues :X ( missing conversions / (more purchase events than ads manager purchases ) or sales not attributed
[17.09.25, 0:20:25] ~ Omar Tayara: Wetracked is missing many conversions for me
[17.09.25, 0:22:16] ~ Adam K.: did you already switch to a different solution ?
[17.09.25, 0:26:00] ~ Cocow😈: We have been categorized since march and were using a tool what was bypassing (bily) cause they were firing évents on their domain. But we do not know who today , our events are completely fucked and a bit afraid 🤣
[17.09.25, 0:55:11] ~ Cocow😈: 🚨To everyone can be important 🚨

Mail from our Capi solution: 

There was indeed a temporary drop in event tracking today, due to a broader disruption in the infrastructure that powers a significant part of the internet — including Shopify. Cloudflare has published their incident report here: Cloudflare Incident Report.

Everything is already back to normal, and your tracking is now fully stable again. There's nothing you need to do on your end.

I know how important this data is to you, which is why we’re also strengthening our own systems to minimize the impact of this kind of incident in the future.

Thanks again for your patience and trust — if you'd like me to explain in more detail how this was reflected in your account, I’m happy to walk you through it.

[18.09.25, 11:11:14] ~ OB: hi guys, does anyone know how to set up 2 different home pages for 2 different countries ?
[18.09.25, 11:11:25] ~ Mo: how much u guys pay ur creators for rushs? just trying to get a rough idea ( simple rushs, using the products, unboxing …)
[18.09.25, 12:28:34] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, what strategy are you currently running on Meta right now?

We’ve been using an ABO creative testing campaign combined with a CBO scaling campaign for years already. Like any setup, it has its pros and cons. What we like about it is that every concept gets a fair shot since each ad set has its own daily budget. The downside, of course, is that we’re “wasting” some budget on non-winners, whereas with a single CBO campaign, Facebook often figures that out faster.

At the moment, we’re pushing out 15–20 new concepts per week (which equals 15-20 new ad sets, with 3 variants inside each ad set).

I’m curious if there are any of you testing and scaling with a single CBO campaign? If so, how do you handle that with the same (or even higher) creative output? We’re testing this approach since last week, launched 19 new concepts into one CBO, and 90% of the budget ended up going almost entirely to one ad set, which means 1 concept out of the 19 we’ve launched, what is incredible for me. Some people say that just means the others weren’t winners, but my concern is that we might be missing out on potential winners with this structure.

What are you guys doing?
[18.09.25, 12:31:46] ~ Ry: Im switching to exactly that as well for testing. But the thing is previous winner in abo, when i test it in cbo structure, it doesnt get much spend. Overall roas is better in cbo though
[18.09.25, 12:33:39] Carlos Leeseman: For me it has some scaling limitations eventually, but maybe I’m wrong and maybe we just have to increase our campaign budget.
[18.09.25, 12:52:28] ~ Daniel: I am using the CBO strategy, and tested it against the ABO + CBO strategy, but the 99% of cases if it didn’t get any spend in the CBO, it wasn’t a winner in the ABO as well, or if it was, it couldn’t hold much spend
[18.09.25, 12:54:13] ~ Daniel: In my case I noticed that facebook wanted to make the ABO look good in my eyes, so he used the creative tests for retargeting which showed good ROAS in the first days, but then it died when I tried to scale, the CBO actually did the heavy lifting
[18.09.25, 12:55:13] Carlos Leeseman: May I ask the spend and amount of ad sets you’re creating inside the CBO?
[18.09.25, 12:56:10] ~ Daniel: spending roughly 10k/day and having 200 ad sets inside the CBO (it’s the max amount), everytime I add new creatives I delete the oldest ad sets in the CBO
[18.09.25, 12:58:28] Carlos Leeseman: Deleting ad sets in CBO is actually pretty fucked, it will delete the data in Tripplewhale lol
[18.09.25, 12:58:42] Carlos Leeseman: But ok, you can create second CBO in that case maybe
[18.09.25, 14:22:12] ~ Daniel: I delete the ad sets that get a few cents in spend, so no data lost
[18.09.25, 14:23:32] ~ Dawid: I have reached the limit of ads in 2 ads sets with the same targeting do you guys have any solutions? So the ad sets don’t compete against each other ?
[18.09.25, 15:22:50] ~ Al: We give all the testing adsets a minimum spend but leave plenty of budget for Meta to do what it wants with the rest. Let them spend for a week at least before turning off unless the initial soft metrics are absolute dog shit
[18.09.25, 15:33:42] ~ m: GUYS N GIRLS - you know how temu lets u add products onto your order without any delivery charge, after you have already checkout, anyone know how to make this happen with shopify

[18.09.25, 16:29:10] ~ Damiano: You can use Free Video Downloader, it has a red download icon, let me know if you can find it
[18.09.25, 16:52:44] ~ Cocow😈: Hello everyone, with checkout champ are u sing as well vidalytics for VSLs ? Or would you recommend something else ? Thanks a lot
[18.09.25, 16:58:38] ~ Filippo: How do you decide the min budget ?
[18.09.25, 17:56:18] ~ Damiano: Hey guys, with all the AI software like ChatGPT and Claude that can do anything if trained properly, how many creatives do you actually write with AI on your weekly batch? Do you still prefer “human” copywriting?
[18.09.25, 18:34:41] ~ Al: we keep it at min $50 for now so it's enough to get some sales in a day but not enough to waste too much spend, because we always wanna run all tests for at least 7 days (unless early data like ctr, hook, hold, cvr are absolute shit). My only rule of thumb is to keep it at 10% or less of total budget. Normally it's less
[18.09.25, 20:06:24] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you typically have one ad eat up all of the spend? I ran the one CBO strat for a while and what kept happening is one ad got 90% of the budget, then when it died the whole CBO collapsed for a while. But many of the ads that got no spend for me worked in abo
[18.09.25, 20:06:47] ~ Kyle Twohill: I was not running minimum spend on tests though so that probably was my mistake
[18.09.25, 20:10:31] ~ Al: not really, we have a bunch of winning ads that get decent spend. But when you're testing a new ad, you can quickly see when something is gonna be a banger. For example recently we got a new winner that's taking 50% of the ad account spend (and it's not a BOF ad), but it'll slowly go back to maybe 20% over time.

Other times it takes an ad ~2 weeks to become a winner and then meta starts pumping budget on it. Not often, but it happens
[18.09.25, 20:10:50] ~ Al: also depends on the state of your account. Our account and brand is 3+ years old and many of our winners have a lot of data behind
[18.09.25, 20:11:22] ~ Al: if we launch a new product and it's all new concepts, yeah normally one takes the big part of the spend but we still wanna run minimum spend on the others bc Meta isn't necessarily great at knowing which ad is best
[18.09.25, 20:11:42] ~ Al: in that case what we'll do is 50% of adspend locked up as minimum spend across all concepts, and 50% free for Meta to do whatever
[18.09.25, 20:12:21] ~ Al: after 1 week, assess performance and see if we need to turn anything off. If something is even breakeven and I know it's a good ad, we'll let it run for another week at least and reassess
[18.09.25, 20:20:22] ~ Kyle Twohill: Thanks for the reply makes sense, Ill try this out this week and see how it goes 🤝
[18.09.25, 20:21:27] ~ Al: lmk how it goes bro! Are you restructuring your ad account for a current winner with a few winning ads, or launching a full new set of ads for a new product?
[18.09.25, 20:30:31] ~ Kyle Twohill: Re structured from mostly one CBO to now simple abo testing and cbo scaling a few winners

[20.09.25, 20:35:40] ~ Ryan: Fraudulent clicks? Use something like clickcease to block bot IPs from the ad auction
[20.09.25, 21:08:52] ~ Mikael: I mean both are payment methods and both would like the company they work with being shown on the website for complience right? Klarna/shopify payments is very strict with this tho. Dont know about paypal thats why I ask
[20.09.25, 21:11:24] ~ harshil Thummar: Platform for virtual debit or credit Card

[21.09.25, 12:11:34] ~ M: for anyone using stripe instead of shopify payments, how do you enable shop pay ?
[21.09.25, 12:39:55] ~ N: Yhh how does someone enable shop pay without Shopify payments
[21.09.25, 12:44:55] ~ Ben Mansour: You have to enable shopify payments and only use shop pay from it
[21.09.25, 12:45:26] ~ N: But for the people using private processors how do you do it
[21.09.25, 12:45:41] ~ N: U can have 2 at the same time ? ‎<This message was edited>
[21.09.25, 12:46:26] ~ Ben Mansour: Shopify allows you to only use shop pay when you have another processor
[21.09.25, 12:46:39] ~ Ben Mansour: But you have to go through the same shopify payments set up
[21.09.25, 12:47:33] ~ N: Will give that a go thank you
[21.09.25, 13:19:44] ~ M: My shopify payments payouts are restricted, do you know any other way without using shopify payments

[21.09.25, 18:29:10] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yes. Although now when you open Shopify payments with LLC you get PayPal automatically with Shopify payments
[21.09.25, 19:32:25] ~ Michael: How?
[21.09.25, 19:34:44] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Any new store opened with Shopify Payments and an LLC comes with PayPal wallet within SP. Just go on the manage payments and you see it
[21.09.25, 20:00:00] ~ Mikael: Is anyone selling to EU with EU/HK company but paying ads with US LLC? Are there any complications or just smooth rolling?
[21.09.25, 20:07:14] ~ Michael: since when?
[21.09.25, 20:09:01] ~ Michael: i dont see it, its still external
[21.09.25, 20:09:28] ~ Michael: why dont you just invoice the LLC as marketing agency
[21.09.25, 20:11:52] ~ Mikael: Yes exactly. This is/was the plan. Just thinking if there is a better and more smoother way for the money flow to have as low/less fees as possible
[21.09.25, 21:05:40] ~ Chris Ciofalo: It absolutely nukes performance for some people

[22.09.25, 14:00:08] ~ Mo: Have done that
[22.09.25, 14:00:37] ~ Mo: If the product delivers then no problem
[22.09.25, 14:00:51] ~ Mo: ( but this doenst mean packaging should be shitty)
[22.09.25, 14:00:56] ~ Joel Cederlund: For testing no worries, 🙂
[22.09.25, 14:26:48] ~ Yusuf: We did that back when testing new products and didn’t cause us any issues so far
[22.09.25, 14:37:27] ~ Michael: thanks, had to create a new backend! Are the fees the same? And how to handle disputes? Through mails ?

[22.09.25, 19:38:53] ~ Adam Radwan: Was anyone using quickcamp, they wanna charge us 4k/mo for just uploading ads lol
[22.09.25, 19:49:56] ~ N: Yhh I saw this a lifetime membership
[22.09.25, 20:39:40] ~ Cocow😈: I would do GTM to fire events to taboola and then compare with TW cause TW is not going to send events to taboola ads manager and this is bad
[23.09.25, 0:55:01] ~ Gustavo Drumm: found any substitute? great platform, but 4k is crazy
[23.09.25, 3:56:20] ~ Christopher Murphy: Does anyone know what Image Gen AI would be the best for product packaging?

[23.09.25, 9:23:32] ~ Gideon: Anyone has experience with Shopify plus. Is the checkout customization worth it?
[23.09.25, 9:51:32] ~ Jeb: In my experience no
[23.09.25, 9:52:03] ~ Jeb: I wish I could back out of it but I signed a few year deal
[23.09.25, 10:06:34] ~ Gideon: Okay. That’s shit. So no big advantages of paying the 2300 usd
[23.09.25, 10:14:16] ~ Cocow😈: It depends , if the volume you are doing monthly is like 800k total and you have like 3/4 stores for that amount of becomes interesting cause you have one subscription for everything 

Furthermore , you have better rates on PSPs so at a certain point based on your volume makes 100% sens 

Finally you have as well the checkout customizations that can bring you the extra AOV and profit daily so it covers everything and even more . If you go into plans you can try shopify plus for 2 months 

Try it , implement the checkout blocks with a CRO agency and try to see the uplift it brings during this trial persons period 

Now with intelligems the checkout can be tested so do it with an agency for 2 months Try, analyse , and then take a decision 

That is our plan so I share it to you 🤣

Note : 2.3k usd for 3 years contract , otherwise this is 2.5k usd for a year
[23.09.25, 14:09:23] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: anybody doing good with quiz funnels? need some help

[23.09.25, 22:23:36] ~ M: they wanna charge 1 time payment instead of monthyl
[23.09.25, 23:08:44] ~ Mo: Guys How do u track CTR on gempages ?
[23.09.25, 23:40:24] ~ Austin: Do you guys pay your funnel devs a weekly "Service Retainer" so they fix problems that come up throughout the week? I understand things break and they need to be improved, but a $3-400 a week retainer sounds like it gives an incentive to not get it done right in the first place when you pay for the project to be complete.
[23.09.25, 23:45:56] ~ Growg: Usually the best way we have tested is - 50hr/month at $500. 
any fixes that needs to be done. This comes out to be 2.5 hour roughly/ day & this helps when you need something in emergency and you have guy who can do, else freelancer usually don’t respond when you need them most. ‎<This message was edited>
[24.09.25, 1:08:43] ~ Alexander Sundström: What is the best way to launch a different product on Shopify for meta ads? Everytime we launch that new product the performance drops. We run the same meta pixel for our hero product and the same for this new product. What is the best solution?

[24.09.25, 11:36:55] ~ RS: Yeah. Was for a few weeks and after that it fixed itself. Support told me just to wait because its their AI
[24.09.25, 11:37:32] ~ RS: It happened for kinda new stripe account that got dispute for fraud. After that stripe risk Ai started blocking random transactions
[24.09.25, 11:38:09] ~ Musawer: So just we need to wait?
[24.09.25, 11:38:18] ~ Monaesh: Yea same for us but it never fixed itself, we just used other payment processors
[24.09.25, 11:39:16] ~ RS: Thats what stripe told me and thats what worked for me. But i used other stripe accs as well because i had different funnels. I put this one problematic stripe account on a funnel with the lowest traffic
[24.09.25, 11:39:56] ~ Musawer: Okay thanks
[24.09.25, 13:16:21] ~ Omar: is there any benefit getting FDA registration for ur company

[24.09.25, 13:39:28] ~ Kimmo: Yeah seems so
[24.09.25, 13:40:16] ~ Steve: Really sucks too because I switched to Chase and have been stacking cash there that they actually want to give me solid business credit cards like the sapphire but can't approve without ITIN

[24.09.25, 16:48:06] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: just like a week

i used them for ein and llc in nex Mexico state i got it last may, and took me one week for all, and they are so good since i forgot to pay the yearly state fees and PO address fees and i didn't check emails from them, they literally texted me on WhatsApp after a week of me not responding to them
[24.09.25, 17:03:05] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: and so cheap too so i recommend that a lot, some like stripe atlas etc charge more
[24.09.25, 17:10:29] ~ Ben Mansour: If anyone wants intro to slash dm me, I have a rep can get you approved in some hours

[25.09.25, 12:54:43] ~ Chris Ciofalo: What’s the difference
[25.09.25, 14:03:12] ~ Steve: for those waiting for ITIN i just got an update from my accounting team from the IRS
[25.09.25, 14:03:13] ~ Steve: Just a courtesy reminder, as you already know, your ITIN application was filed to/received by the IRS on May 12th, 2025 and therefore is part of the 2nd week of May 2025 batch of ITIN applications at the IRS ITIN Department.

The IRS has advised us that we are not authorized to provide an exact time frame for how long this will take. The reason they have stated this to us is simply because the IRS ITIN Department is working to catch up on their backlog caused from the past holiday season and current US tax season. As a result they can not determine when they will be caught up on their backlog but rather provide updates on their progress and what batch of applications they have completed and what batches of ITIN applications they are currently working on.

The latest update we have received from the IRS in regards to your case and general ITIN Application processing:

-The IRS has finished processing all ITIN applications up to May 2025.

[25.09.25, 14:03:34] ~ Steve: if you applied in May, you’re likely in the next approved batch
[25.09.25, 17:01:24] ~ M A N U E L: Hey guys, anyone have experience with Marcel Sattler? This is his agency for native ads: native-advertising.net

Or does anyone knows a reliable agency for Native Ads?
[25.09.25, 18:26:45] Amit Wadhawan: So the biggest issues I was having with Seal
* the customer portal really sucks
- no cancellation flow.
- ⁠poor analytics

Loop just is better at all those things. I think for me the customer portal and cancellation flow make it worth the extra cost.
I would recommend Seal if you’re starting out with subscriptions and building up your first few hundred subs but after that it’s worth moving to a better service (Loop/Skio/etc)
[25.09.25, 18:37:42] ~ Daniel: hey guys, anyone having issues publishing ads at the moment?
[25.09.25, 19:02:24] ~ Mo: guys im using gPT4.5 but dont have the “deep research” feature, how do u enable it ?
[25.09.25, 19:42:25] ~ Adam Radwan: even if you have 7 fig mrr with them?
[25.09.25, 19:45:57] ~ Cocow😈: Pay lol , or go in the +
[25.09.25, 19:47:05] ~ Mo: Im in the business plan already cant go +
[25.09.25, 20:14:44] Amit Wadhawan: i guess it’s not that black and white. If Seal is working well and has everything you need, you’ll save a lot of money staying with it. If you want to optimize the customer experience but also save some subs via a cancellation flow, Seal won’t help with that.
[25.09.25, 20:15:37] ~ Adam Radwan: the migration would be flawless, no loss in subs?
[25.09.25, 20:16:21] Amit Wadhawan: My migration was definitely not flawless. Had a ton of issues for a few days but it all got sorted out.
[25.09.25, 20:17:53] Amit Wadhawan: I thought they would be better at the migration since they would have done it before but if I were to do it again, I would ask them to do it in small batches first to test and make sure there’s no issues. ‎<This message was edited>
[25.09.25, 20:19:56] Amit Wadhawan: Maybe a different platform would have a better migration experience.
[25.09.25, 20:37:03] ~ Dawid: What upsale app do you guys use?
[25.09.25, 22:00:00] ~ Cocow😈: Then limitations of country probably

[26.09.25, 0:15:21] Shayan: It’s pretty terrible so far ^
[26.09.25, 0:15:56] Shayan: Tried using it in our workflows, better off just using nano and veo
[26.09.25, 9:00:22] ~ Mo: guys one dropshipper took down my facebook ads twice, he’s ripping off my content. i appealed with proof thats its my content/ my media ssets/ photo shootings/ ugc & contracts with my creators… its ben over a month now and no reply so far from meta. what should I do next ?

[26.09.25, 12:19:23] ~ Kimmo: Remove the exposed person from your BM asap - then all u can do is to send requests for money back to fb through their customer service
[26.09.25, 12:20:06] ~ Kimmo: I had the same thing happen to me and I believe I got like 9k back - still missing 3k. But I was able to recover and we still use that same account
[26.09.25, 12:20:46] ~ Kimmo: I never bothered to report them anywhere or do anything beside getting most of my money back and moving on. But u can try
[26.09.25, 12:24:09] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can also chargeback with your bank
[26.09.25, 12:24:19] ~ Alvaro De Prada: But it will compromise the BM
[26.09.25, 13:35:15] ~ Andrej: Yea, meta usually refunds you if you have a good history and it’s obvious that it wasn’t you who was spending it
[26.09.25, 15:13:52] ~ N: How long are your orders to Uk taking from china to UK 

Who’s got the best 3pl with fastest shipping
[26.09.25, 15:18:23] ~ Rustam: can confirm
[26.09.25, 15:18:45] ~ Rustam: Guys anyone has any 3pls in the US where I can store a 100 units just to quickly ship to influencers?

[27.09.25, 11:37:52] Carlos Leeseman: Anyone seeing better results with Checkout Champ compared to Funnelish?

Our developer is re-building the funnel in Checkout Champ now but it feels like we’re going 100 steps back with a lot of issues and bugs 🤣
[27.09.25, 11:51:19] ~ Matteo: Anybody has contact from Dusan from Wakeupmedia?
[27.09.25, 11:52:20] ~ m: how do u do this
[27.09.25, 12:02:16] Topi: Shopify >>>>
[27.09.25, 12:08:14] Carlos Leeseman: We need advertorials and this is shit on Shopify + we can’t do VSL as upsell
[27.09.25, 12:35:56] ~ Monaesh: If you’re running any kind of rebill or subscription checkout champ is superior. 

It’s a better platform but much more complex to setup so depends whether you need it
[27.09.25, 12:36:07] ~ Caesar: where do you turn this on or off?
‎[27.09.25, 12:59:52] ~ Mithiran: ‎image omitted
[27.09.25, 13:00:09] ~ Mithiran: @⁨~Caesar⁩
[27.09.25, 13:01:28] ~ Caesar: Is that an advantage + optimization option that is turned on by default?
[27.09.25, 13:04:36] ~ Mithiran: nope, i dont think it is
[27.09.25, 18:07:38] ~ Guy Edan: What do you find works well on Shopify to increase AOV? Our upsell take rate on funnelish are much better than Shopify
[27.09.25, 18:09:38] Topi: In europe, there’s no way around the 3rd party payment processors to increase AOV, so thank you page upsells drive the highest rev

In the US, you can create everything you need with aftersell, a mini lander if thats needed
[27.09.25, 18:10:42] ~ Guy Edan: For those of you who run one scaling CBO campaign, what are you looking for to increase budgets? (For example 3 days of target roas)? Also, do you increase the budget mid day or at 12 am? ‎<This message was edited>
[27.09.25, 18:23:08] ~ Mo: guys i have a testing ABO campaign, and CBO scaling. The creatives in ABO always perform better, but flops in CBO. for now i just keep increasing budget in the ABO winning adsets. anyone experience this ? ‎<This message was edited>
[27.09.25, 18:56:46] ~ Alex Usovs: Yes, don’t be attached to ABO/CBO/ASC I suggest continuing raising budget and not to try and force making CBO work. 
Worth noting, CBO typically takes few days to truly understand which ad/ads to spend money on.
[27.09.25, 19:19:47] ~ Steve: Anyone have a Google ads contact? My buddy had his account shut down and doesn’t know why. Multiple appeals and still not back on. He tried an agency as well and they couldn’t get it back on either. Any help appreciated
[27.09.25, 19:22:55] ~ Omar: Anyone got a PayPal insider for HK paypals

My one has stopped working with PayPal
[27.09.25, 22:49:06] ~ Guy Edan: Do u guys increase budgets for ur CBO mid day or at 12 am? Do you find that it matters?
[27.09.25, 22:49:49] ~ Austin: Personally I don't see a huge difference on when budget increases
[27.09.25, 22:50:48] ~ Austin: I do prefer mid day through
[27.09.25, 22:55:07] ~ Johir.E: What software are you guys using for fb bulk uploading?
[27.09.25, 22:55:58] ~ Austin: Quickcampaigns....might be changing that after their 3-5K charge though....
[27.09.25, 22:56:54] ~ Johir.E: everything else is shit
[27.09.25, 22:57:12] ~ Johir.E: kitchnn.io seems to have closed for some reason
[27.09.25, 23:45:16] ~ Michael: Guys any TIPPS to lower 70-120$ cpm on the first day in a product test while all other metrics are strong ?
[27.09.25, 23:45:52] ~ Ben Mansour: Keep spending
[27.09.25, 23:46:11] ~ Ben Mansour: I had $400 before
[27.09.25, 23:47:37] ~ Giorgos: Im getting 2_3 hundred on a new batch of videos. 3$ uniq cpc. This shit impossible to work out
[27.09.25, 23:49:14] ~ Michael: When does it get better
[27.09.25, 23:49:20] ~ Giorgos: I guess ill stick w statics
[28.09.25, 0:51:22] ~ Brett Fallarino: Test new products, new offers, new concepts & keep spending to lower CPM's. Some products just have way higher CPM's from my experience
[28.09.25, 0:51:48] ~ Brett Fallarino: Might take 1-2 months of consistent spend to lower CPMs
[28.09.25, 0:52:04] ~ Ben Mansour: Started going lower after like 5 days
[28.09.25, 0:53:47] ~ Mike Kasdorf: One of my brands was $100+ cpm with statics only. I started adding videos and cpms dropped to high $50s in 3-4 days.

[28.09.25, 10:10:27] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Creative -> landing page congruence
[28.09.25, 10:11:20] ~ Cocow😈: First image one of the biggest lift 

And after offer + prices + scarcity have been the biggest impacts for us
[28.09.25, 10:11:27] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you have 65+ women in ads, have the same age and gender in landing page, plus talk about the same
[28.09.25, 10:20:19] ~ Mo: i have a transformation product, do u put before/after image first ?
[28.09.25, 10:21:11] ~ Mo: congruence is key, i’ll double check that 🙏
[28.09.25, 10:31:57] ~ Cocow😈: You need to ab tests on image

And other for sure but that was what we made 

You can mix this. 

Guarantee that you can’t surprised 

In our case our winning image is

[28.09.25, 17:30:54] ~ Austin: Hey guys, how much do you pay your creative strategist?
[28.09.25, 18:42:59] ~ AK: Hi everyone 👋 I’m currently selling a beauty/hair care product through dropshipping, but now I want to take it further and build a real brand. Our vision is to improve the current formula with high-quality, effective ingredients so customers actually see results.

I’m looking for reliable manufacturers or cosmetic labs who can help with custom formulation and product development. If you have any contacts or recommendations, I’d really appreciate it 🙏
[28.09.25, 18:43:54] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Hahaha ”actually see results” 😂
[28.09.25, 18:44:17] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Good luck bro🥰
[28.09.25, 18:46:27] ~ AK: i bought the same product from main brand who manufactured product and it’s actually working lol, just products we are shipping from China, which most likely are all knock off with fake ingredients are not working
[28.09.25, 18:47:08] ~ AK: just want to transition to proper brand from dropshipping, not just doing white label and changing packaging, but making better product with actual ingredients
[28.09.25, 18:51:43] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Send the product to a lab on China to reverse engineer the ingredient %’s and use ChatGPT to improve upon it
[28.09.25, 18:53:35] ~ AK: thanks bro will try that
[29.09.25, 0:00:27] ~ Austin: Does anyone have great checkout champ developer? Or developer in general? Please DM.

[30.09.25, 10:30:22] ~ Monaesh: Does anyone else see that longer ads don’t work as well towards the end of year?
[30.09.25, 11:42:12] ~ Felix: Higher competition => higher CPM and therefore different bids in the placement auction of Meta

[30.09.25, 17:44:12] ~ Tariq: Some people have actual transformations by using finasteride and minoxidil, so they already did that process and got their hair back, you can just pay them to say its because of your product lol
[30.09.25, 17:44:34] ~ Filippo: ive seen ads where people show the product in use since Month 0
[30.09.25, 17:45:00] ~ Guy Edan: Hair extension?
[30.09.25, 17:45:07] ~ Filippo: no
[30.09.25, 17:45:11] ~ Filippo: hair loss serums

[30.09.25, 17:51:14] ~ Tariq: That can be edited, Im talking just the transformation itself
[30.09.25, 17:51:34] ~ Tariq: Or they can show that they're using a serum while they're just taking finasteride
[30.09.25, 18:18:38] ~ Giorgos: The question is.. How do i corrupt my ugc actors? 😭 ‎<This message was edited>

[30.09.25, 20:15:09] ~ Guy Edan: Does anyone here sell in the US and their Shopify store converts better than their funnelish/checkout champ? Or do funnels perform better 99% of the time? ‎<This message was edited>
[30.09.25, 20:29:06] ~ Matthew Martorano: I can say that Checkout Champs checkout for shopify increases conversions and AOV significantly, but also the use of sales funnels for paid traffic is the main driver of high conversion rates.
[30.09.25, 21:24:27] ~ Fabian: someone knows a guy working at rockads?
[1.10.25, 0:30:54] ~ Emanuel Sabelsjö: Hey guys, how/where do you find and hire great video editors?
[1.10.25, 1:17:26] ~ Shri Kanase: Upwork / online jobs.ph
[1.10.25, 1:51:38] Fabian: Hey guys

For anyone wondering about the Shopify X ChatGPT update - 

My SEO team built this: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17a9CSdGok--XMq7QMSyvMZDrGxguy8hnQYFLIQ5O9oc/edit?usp=sharing

Highly recommend to send this to your dev team to implement
[1.10.25, 10:16:04] ~ Rick: Hi guys, what do you think I should do about a competitor who stole my PDP content, but who I can't take down because he uses page builder tactics? 
Since he's using my stuff, I stole all his creative content and am using it myself. Now he's written to me threatening to file a DMCA complaint if I don't remove all the material I stole from him.

I have a registered trademark and also sell on Amazon, while he is a dropshipper. What can I do to shut him up?
[1.10.25, 10:16:19] ~ Rick: @⁨~Alvaro De Prada⁩ can you give me some tips?
[1.10.25, 10:17:01] ~ Rick: If I file the DMCA on the creative content first, will it work?
[1.10.25, 10:31:11] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You both are going to enter a DMCA battle, id be the first one to strike if you are in the right
[1.10.25, 10:32:03] ~ Rick: okay, that's what I thought thanks G ‎<This message was edited>
[1.10.25, 10:41:14] ~ Rick: How does it work on Meta? Do you look at the publication date, or does the first one to file a DMCA win?
[1.10.25, 10:42:28] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Meta nor fb don’t look at publication date. When sending a DMCA they are obligated to put the video down, that’s why fake dmca are a thing
[1.10.25, 10:45:55] ~ Rick: Okay, but if I take it down, how can he file a DMCA counter-notice if he no longer has any active creative works?
[1.10.25, 10:46:20] ~ Molka: I think it takes time for his creatives to be down not from the first attempt
[1.10.25, 10:47:02] ~ Rick: So in the meantime he will file a DMCA complaint. Is there any value in having a registered trademark and selling on Amazon?
[1.10.25, 10:49:50] ~ Molka: Only if they use ur name i think
[1.10.25, 10:50:25] ~ Alvaro De Prada: he gets an email with the information and a link to counter it
[1.10.25, 10:50:58] ~ Alvaro De Prada: FB and Shopify don't care... they have to legally bring the assets down no matter who is in the right
[1.10.25, 10:51:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: you need to go to court agaisnt the person doing the DMCA + Shopify
[1.10.25, 10:51:53] ~ Rick: So if someone does that to me with my stolen materials, they knock me down regardless? Crazy shit
[1.10.25, 10:52:47] ~ Rick: i ripped all his content but i modify it with brand original content i only keep his structure and b-roll ‎<This message was edited>
[1.10.25, 10:54:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: even with your own materials
[1.10.25, 10:54:48] ~ Rick: ddaaammmnnnn
[1.10.25, 10:55:49] ~ Rick: Okay, I'll think about what to do then. I don't know how much sense it makes to fight this DMCA battle. It's more risky to be taken down in pre-Q4 than to turn off his ads and redo them.
[1.10.25, 10:55:51] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I just got a dmca where someone bought my brand domain but different .xxx and they dmca my entire page
[1.10.25, 10:55:57] ~ Molka: I think h can copy and paste the “copy” but not the scenes so if u dont wanna get DMCA just change the scenes use ur own or steal from timtok and YouTube
[1.10.25, 10:56:12] ~ Rick: and what you do ?
[1.10.25, 10:56:25] ~ Molka: If u have a trademark u can fuck them up
[1.10.25, 10:56:53] ~ Alvaro De Prada: yeah I got a trademark... just need to know who did it because can't find through whois
[1.10.25, 10:57:08] ~ Alvaro De Prada: got hundreds of ads attacked last night
[1.10.25, 10:57:14] ~ Alvaro De Prada: and they bought the domain a week ago
[1.10.25, 10:57:40] ~ Alvaro De Prada: kind of insane the fucked up ways some people try to compete
[1.10.25, 10:57:43] ~ Molka: Can j just search people with ur domain and link it to who ?
[1.10.25, 10:57:54] ~ Rick: for real
[1.10.25, 11:00:48] ~ Rick: I think I'll eat it by spending more than him on ads, make sense?
[1.10.25, 11:01:20] ~ Alvaro De Prada: depends.... if he does the dmca then he brings you down
[1.10.25, 11:02:36] ~ Rick: I don't want war, I just want competitors with ethics. I hope it doesn't happen, so I'm starting from the premise that I won't do it. We'll see.
[1.10.25, 11:03:15] ~ Rick: do you have an agency for brand protection or you do it internally? ‎<This message was edited>
[1.10.25, 11:03:56] ~ Adam Radwan: Good luck in business if you think people have ethics
[1.10.25, 11:04:45] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Unfortunatelly is war... and big time... I lost many hundreds of thousands trying to be the good guy
[1.10.25, 11:05:20] ~ Alvaro De Prada: I've got somethings to protect me.... but when you get copyright strikes... is very difficult even if they are 100% fake
[1.10.25, 11:05:28] ~ Rick: I know how it works in e-commerce. I've been doing it for four years and I'm aware that, unfortunately, there are very few people with ethics in this field, but I also think that the actions you take have a value that will be rewarded over time.
[1.10.25, 11:06:46] ~ Rick: So, thinking like this, attack is the best defense, ready to launch DMCA strikes 🥲
[1.10.25, 11:07:04] ~ Adam Radwan: Yea very annoying, cease and desist usually does the job
[1.10.25, 11:07:15] ~ Rick: I hope it's not one of you in this group 🤣
[1.10.25, 11:07:23] ~ Alvaro De Prada: yeah... if you know where to send it 😂
[1.10.25, 11:08:15] Topi: we use agency
[1.10.25, 11:08:20] ~ Alvaro De Prada: He made it look like i'm DMCAming myself on FB... no website active... just the domain bought an email creation ‎<This message was edited>

[1.10.25, 11:08:43] ~ Rick: damn the Goat...

[1.10.25, 11:09:30] ~ Rick: when a meet up in veneto?
[1.10.25, 11:10:03] ~ Rick: we are starting with an agency so the Q4 could be more smoother and hassle-free
[1.10.25, 11:12:06] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Between this shit and fake chargebacks... i'm just going to start noshipping and fuck it 😂
[1.10.25, 11:27:14] ~ N: How fast are payouts with a USA stripe?
[1.10.25, 11:27:20] ~ N: Brand new account
[1.10.25, 11:27:37] ~ Rick: 7 days if I’m not wrong
[1.10.25, 11:27:52] ~ N: U sure?
[1.10.25, 11:28:10] ~ N: I was told there’s benefits to using USA stripe

One being faster payout
[1.10.25, 11:28:44] ~ Rick: after you start using it, it goes to 3 days
[1.10.25, 11:28:52] ~ Rick: and after 1 day
[1.10.25, 11:29:13] ~ Rick: but you need like no chargeback in the beginning
[1.10.25, 12:55:53] ~ M: does anyone have a solid EU private payment processor to recommend ?
[1.10.25, 12:57:27] ~ Johir.E: I’m after one aswell to process payments in UK
[1.10.25, 16:52:36] ~ Mike Ramsey: There’s several but depends on your risk profile and volume levels you are processing.  Feel free to DM and I can provide some recs
[1.10.25, 19:02:56] ~ Garo Antossian: Hey guys! We are trying to recover a crucial Hotmail account where the automated recovery form is completely useless.. Any help finding a person who can escalate this would be a lifesaver. Thanks!
[1.10.25, 19:02:58] ~ Garo Antossian: Would really appreciate any lead or connection — even someone from support or an insider who can escalate the case. Thanks a lot in advance! 🙌🏼
[1.10.25, 19:17:12] ~ …: Hey guys 👋,

[1.10.25, 21:13:06] ~ Antonio Celani: Lian Lian Global
[1.10.25, 21:13:35] ~ Riccardo Sonetti: Hi guys, I recently set up a US LLC (after my HK company got banned from Shopify Payments). I’ve already received my EIN, but I still need to wait a few more months to get my ITIN.

Has anyone here been able to use a US LLC with Shopify Payments using only the EIN without the ITIN?
[1.10.25, 21:44:55] ~ Ben Mansour: You don‘t need itin
[1.10.25, 21:45:02] ~ Ben Mansour: Use ein instead

[2.10.25, 10:45:58] ~ Anatoly: Anyone had success throwing large volume of diversified creatives into the same adset (like 20-50 creatives) under new Andromeda algo?
[2.10.25, 10:48:00] ~ Steve: working ok so far
[2.10.25, 10:48:42] ~ Steve: we used to break them out by variant in chunks of 5. So 1 variant + 5 scroll stoppers
[2.10.25, 10:49:00] ~ Steve: now we just take like 20, throw them all together and increase budget on it
[2.10.25, 10:49:25] ~ Steve: hard to say if its working better than the other way since its only been like 2 weeks, but doesnt seem to be working any worse at least
[2.10.25, 11:02:04] ~ Mithiran: Yeah we tested like 20 ads in one adset and it worked really good. But idk if u should do it for testing ads
[2.10.25, 11:08:02] ~ Anatoly: How would you go about testing then, the old way?
[2.10.25, 11:12:13] ~ Anatoly: Do you find some creatives get a lot of spend when others just a few $$ despite good front metrics and engagement? I am seeing it a lot for some reason, both for video and static campaigns
[2.10.25, 11:13:49] ~ Steve: yes
[2.10.25, 11:14:09] ~ Steve: just have to be a little more vigilent about it, try and make sure each concept in there gets some spend
[2.10.25, 11:14:22] ~ Steve: thats why we start it with a higher budget than usual
[2.10.25, 11:15:20] ~ Moonis Ali: Hy guys can anyone help me with the new sora invite code plz

[2.10.25, 11:54:26] ~ Mithiran: Is it recommended to use shopify payments to sell supplements?

[2.10.25, 15:08:03] Topi: I have few you can ask
[2.10.25, 15:29:00] ~ Mikael: Anyone using US LLC with airwallex as payments? And got fast payouts?
[2.10.25, 15:36:03] ~ Michael: i got rejected with LLC, did it work for you?
[2.10.25, 15:36:50] ~ Mikael: Ive not tried with LLC yet. But with HK LTD I needed to have someone inside inorder to get good payout time..
[2.10.25, 15:43:45] ~ Michael: how long do they keep it with hk ltd? since im also trying to use it right now
[2.10.25, 15:56:54] Fabian: Anyone has a contact to remove YT video?
[2.10.25, 16:01:35] ~ Mikael: Different each time for each LTD. Best we had was 6 day payout with Klarna and all payment methods. Without klarna is generallt faster
[2.10.25, 16:05:08] ~ Michael: Do u use PayPal airwallex or external?
[2.10.25, 16:22:47] ~ Mikael: Paypal external
[2.10.25, 16:46:04] ~ Michael: Did u yet it without problems for HK ltd? Got banned immediately with HK aswell as german
[2.10.25, 17:32:11] ~ Mikael: They suspended 2 accs for us which we used as payment methods. The other with only banking are fine

[2.10.25, 19:44:48] ~ Ry: anybody using funnelish + wetracked? is your data on WT dashboard way off now?
[2.10.25, 19:46:30] ~ Carlos: I've noticed most of you guys are running advertorials on either funnelish or checkout champ, if you moved from Shopify to advertorials, did you notice a CPM increase on Meta?

I've created advertorials that convert better than my Shopify product pages, but CPMs for advertorials are consistently double than those of Shopify for me. Is this a common experience or skill issue ? 😅
[2.10.25, 19:47:53] ~ Austin: As soon as i went too funnelish, CPM jumped and CR dropped...AOV jumped higher, but did not make up for the downfalls
[2.10.25, 19:48:34] ~ Austin: We now use shopify front end and champ back end and find no CR drop or CPM increase and still get AOV jump
[2.10.25, 19:48:50] ~ Austin: Oh and way way way less funnel breaks and over all issues
[2.10.25, 19:55:50] ~ Carlos: thank you. yeah, this is exactly my experience
[2.10.25, 19:57:15] ~ Carlos: but are you still running advertorials on something like replo or just traditional product pages? I've thought about a solution like that but I assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that it would worsen Meta optimization

[3.10.25, 9:36:35] Carlos Leeseman: Better use MP4, better quality and lower file size

[4.10.25, 1:53:24] ~ Adam Radwan: 300/mo
[4.10.25, 2:03:53] ~ Denis Mihin: I did it with TruLease. Had same issue, with Trulease you can get the utility bill and also just the us lease. Worked for me flawlessly. If shopify somehow rejects your lease you can get that utility bill that 100% will work
[4.10.25, 2:04:07] ~ Denis Mihin: Im also from Eu

[4.10.25, 11:48:29] ~ Phil: I would assume so. So many podcasts reels go viral these days
[4.10.25, 11:48:59] ~ Filippo: overthinking the fact that a younger audience could tell its AI generated

[4.10.25, 14:42:19] ~ Damiano: Maybe it’s wrong, try to install Post Id Finder extension so you can find the right post Id when you open the ads preview

But why not let clients skip at least with a button somewhere, cause this is really bad client experience

[5.10.25, 6:54:13] ~ Monaesh: Vidalytics
[5.10.25, 6:55:13] ~ Monaesh: Unskippable post purchase VSLs are super common especially for 50+ demographic. We run it for under 50 market and it works really well.
[5.10.25, 6:56:19] ~ Monaesh: We’ve seen people have upsells with take rates of 20% all the way to 70% in some cases

[5.10.25, 10:41:39] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Take into account conversion fee, go to 5/5.5%
[5.10.25, 10:50:28] ~ Mo: this for US paypal right ?
[5.10.25, 10:51:43] ~ Mo: found this also for stripe not sure if this is correct
‎[5.10.25, 10:51:51] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
[5.10.25, 10:54:08] ~ Alvaro De Prada: All PayPal’s have conversion fee on the other currencies
[5.10.25, 10:56:10] ~ Alvaro De Prada: My suggestion is to set up tw on the highest cost of everything. This way you can run/scale your store following tw data knowing that all costs are higher than it should (payment gateway fees, shipping & pick and pack)
[5.10.25, 10:57:34] ~ Alvaro De Prada: This if you sell more than one SKU and sell WW shipping from China
[5.10.25, 10:57:54] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you are local and your costs are somewhat fixed… then up to you
[5.10.25, 10:59:08] ~ Mo: yes better doing this than getting surprised later
[5.10.25, 11:00:29] ~ Mo: yes thats my case
[5.10.25, 11:05:33] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Then this is exactly what I do:

Get 3/4 bills from agent where you have a ton of orders and divide them by country. 

Get the average shipping cost of each country and get the countries where you have 60-70% of the shipments. Comprare full 3/4 bills to last bill to see if your costs are going up or down or staying the same.

For those countries, on TW put shipping price as AVG + X$ (what you are comfortable with, I put 7). For the other countries, put AVG +1

Pick and pack depends on your set up, I pay flat fee no mater what so 1.5. If you pay by product, then get an AVG of entire bill and add 30/40% 

Cogs: exact cost
[5.10.25, 11:06:06] ~ Alvaro De Prada: With this tw still shows profit but my BE is 1.4ish instead of 1.3
[5.10.25, 11:14:01] ~ Mo: Got it bro
[5.10.25, 11:14:41] ~ Mo: Taking notes !
[5.10.25, 11:15:02] ~ Mo: Same for me my bE is 1.6 instead of 1.4
[5.10.25, 12:03:18] ~ Monaesh: Do you add in other fixed costs in TW like staff subscriptions etc. or do you keep it strictly operational
[5.10.25, 12:05:45] ~ Alvaro De Prada: strictly operational day to day
[5.10.25, 12:06:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: get a proper accounting software that connects to banks for staff, subscriptions, content ecc
[5.10.25, 12:32:33] ~ Garo Antossian: 🚀 Hey everyone!

We’re looking to bring on a TikTok media buyer to help us launch and scale a new ad channel for our brand. We’re doing strong numbers on Meta & Google, and now want to double down on TikTok with someone who really understands creative testing, scaling strategies, and performance optimization.

If you know anyone experienced (agency or freelancer) who’s actively running successful TikTok campaigns for eCom brands, please tag them here or DM me — would love to connect. 🙌
[5.10.25, 13:15:03] ~ Cocow: Yes but then, what is the refund rate on this take rate because people just want to see the confirmation page and they feel stuck. As well how people really feel after being forced to see a 10 min upsell VSL or more… Not sure how this is good for brand reputation.
[5.10.25, 13:31:09] ~ Monaesh: Basically 0% refund rate on upsell
[5.10.25, 13:31:12] ~ Monaesh: Depends on positioning of the offer
[5.10.25, 13:31:45] ~ Monaesh: Some people are confused initially but overall people don’t mind
[5.10.25, 13:32:54] ~ Monaesh: Especially if it’s a more of the same upsell people don’t complain at all
[5.10.25, 13:34:20] ~ Giorgos: You first comfort them and all that. It's never straight to force upsell vsl..
[5.10.25, 13:35:09] ~ Monaesh: Exactly
[5.10.25, 13:36:02] ~ Monaesh: Show why they made a good purchase and more good reviews
[5.10.25, 13:36:31] ~ Monaesh: Then give them an exclusive offer for existing customers only
[5.10.25, 14:30:27] ~ Cocow: Ok then this is really surprising haha 

So you but zero button for people to escale the video haha ?
[5.10.25, 14:31:04] ~ Monaesh: Nope
[5.10.25, 14:31:16] ~ Monaesh: Only after they see they offer

[5.10.25, 15:00:39] ~ Steve: this works to remove the watermark for free - also $49 for the paid version but it was fast for me
[5.10.25, 15:01:01] ~ Steve: probably sora lets you remove watermark in the next month or so anyways but this is helpful as we’ve done a ton of b-roll for ads this week and now can remove the watermark
[5.10.25, 15:17:38] ~ Giorgos: Can i get to use sora2 from vpn? Cos of geo restrictions
[5.10.25, 15:19:14] ~ Steve: yeah with vpn no issues
[5.10.25, 15:19:35] ~ Alexander Lundberg: You have to download it from app store right?
[5.10.25, 15:26:21] ~ Steve: no

[5.10.25, 19:29:36] ~ Anatoly: Anyone using Funnelish noticed their Meta pixes are not firing on new funnels, created after their recent platform upgrade? I can only get pixels to work when installed manually with code and not via “Apps” section. Tested on different pixels and funnels - same thing, wondering if someone else has the same issue?
[5.10.25, 19:32:30] ~ Adam K.: while using wetracked/triple whale? or without any tracking solution?
[5.10.25, 19:34:15] ~ Anatoly: Without any 3rd party apps. The issue seems to be affecting new funnels only. All old funnels where the pixel was installed before platform upgrade work normally, as expected.

[5.10.25, 23:17:37] ~ Zsombor: Pretty good
[5.10.25, 23:18:28] ~ Zsombor: There always will be inconsistencies, you shouldn't judge performance just by 1 day
[5.10.25, 23:18:57] ~ Fabian: Ofcourse, but its little bit odd to go from 4 roas to 1,9
[5.10.25, 23:19:18] ~ Zsombor: Well it happened to me many times 😅
[5.10.25, 23:19:22] ~ Zsombor: Then it went back up
[5.10.25, 23:19:49] ~ Fabian: okok good to know, never seen this myself💪 seen drops but not 50%
[5.10.25, 23:20:02] ~ Fabian: Thank you
[5.10.25, 23:28:49] Carlos Leeseman: Check what’s causing the drop. Change in CPM, CPC? Or maybe something happening in your funnel

I’m opening my Airbnb for 2–3 other operators to stay with me to create a small group focused on maximizing the impact and takeaways from the event.

Did the same for the Dubai event and it turned out to be one of the best parts of the trip. The after hours strategy sessions, shared insights, and lasting connections were just as valuable as what happened inside the room.

If you’re doing at least $500K+/month and want to stay with other serious players, DM me for details. ‎<This message was edited>

[7.10.25, 21:24:12] ~ Fabian: Don’t know the best but I would recommend Google Ai studio for images , results are very good and you can easily Edit already existing images without the ai recreating the whole image

[7.10.25, 21:25:22] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Wow not bad
[7.10.25, 21:25:52] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: midjourney is currently the best for sure ‎<This message was edited>
[7.10.25, 22:12:54] ~ Jan: How do you mantain constistency in products/characters there as good as in chatgpt or gemini?
[7.10.25, 22:30:10] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: the tool itself it’s way more consistent than these two, provided detailed accurate prompting. chatgpt and gemini are wonky in comparison to midjourney ‎<This message was edited>
[7.10.25, 22:32:33] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: have a good graphic designer on it
[8.10.25, 0:30:31] ~ Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari: need a google tags manager expert or dev who can help us track deposits.
[8.10.25, 1:15:11] ~ VH0: I had a guy who did this with great precision for me. He combined a few tools and midjourney wasn’t even there. 😃 The characters had the same look, the same clothes, he could change the clothes he could change the hairstyle, he could animate them. It felt like magic.
[8.10.25, 2:04:03] ~ Steph: Hey @⁨~Rudra Ravindranath Tiwari⁩ 
We can help with this if you need
[8.10.25, 4:08:25] ~ Mo: hey guys, my competitor is blasting fake reviews on my trustpilot page, guy managing my TP account sent them legal email + threat of defamation , anyting else that u guys would do in this case ?
[8.10.25, 5:16:39] ~ Steph: Try contacting Trustpilot potentially and proving there is no invoice associated with the reviews. Be mindful though if you yourself are posting your own fake reviews.
[8.10.25, 5:19:21] ~ Adam Radwan: are they doing anything else or just TP?
[8.10.25, 5:44:51] ~ Mo: yeah we did this, no we dont posting fake reviews
[8.10.25, 5:45:13] ~ Mo: for now just TP
[8.10.25, 11:19:11] ~ N: Does anyone farm comments under there ads 

Have they seen any negative impact
[8.10.25, 13:10:46] ~ Davide: Do you guys cover the cost of tools and software for your employees, or do they handle and pay for their own subscriptions?
[8.10.25, 13:11:08] ~ 🔋: 😳
[8.10.25, 13:12:22] ~ Alexander Lundberg: If they are employed under my company I pay. However freelancers I expect them to have the relevant tools for the job
[8.10.25, 13:23:47] ~ Monaesh: When you say farm do you mean via engagement campaigns or do you mean buying comments ?
[8.10.25, 13:24:02] ~ N: Buying comments
[8.10.25, 14:17:15] ~ AK: How do I get exact ad for them to comment want to try this?

Just from post id should work ya? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.10.25, 14:19:52] ~ Fabian: I’ve seen no impact when both buying engagement and commenting myself , but no upside either so I don’t do it
[8.10.25, 14:33:07] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: Really? I feel like it woukd increase performance a lot if people see a lot of good commments underneath 

Seen Norse organics do this a lot
[8.10.25, 14:33:29] ~ Mithiran: I just comment from my company Facebook page with an image + text testimonial. I know it makes an impact because I get 20- 30 likes on the image
[8.10.25, 14:34:03] ~ N: Yhh this is what I was thinking

Show an image of the product saying good stuff about it
[8.10.25, 14:34:09] ~ Mo: image of customer/product + testim ? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.10.25, 14:38:10] ~ Mithiran: No image of the testimonial we got, we get a lot of photo testimonials. And then put the review then add a “- Jane W.” For example
[8.10.25, 14:41:17] ~ Monaesh: Or even if you have a video testimonial
[8.10.25, 14:41:27] ~ Monaesh: It helps a lot especially if you address objections
[8.10.25, 14:44:01] ~ Mo: U post it like here is a testimonial from our customer etc…
[8.10.25, 14:44:06] ~ Mo: Rigt
[8.10.25, 14:44:21] ~ Mithiran: Yeah
[8.10.25, 15:15:27] ~ Fabian: I’ve seen no upside but I also feel like there should be an upside , but I don’t think there will be a big increase in conversions

Tbh I don’t have to much data to speak on this but all I can say is : I’ve never seen big difference when boosting engagement
[8.10.25, 15:58:01] ~ VH0: This is really weird. lol
[8.10.25, 15:59:49] ~ VH0: By “employees”, you mean employees and not contractors or freelancers, right? Of course you pay for their tools and subscriptions. 😂
[8.10.25, 16:10:18] ~ Elad daskal: Hey, does anyone know specialists in incrementality testing, cross-platform performance, or similar areas in data-analysis? We’re looking for an expert consultant to support our brands.

[8.10.25, 22:17:46] ~ Ben Mansour: Shulex
[8.10.25, 22:25:42] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. question on surf scaling:
I saw Alex’s recent video where he talks about doubling the budget every 3 hours if roas is above target, and then resetting it at 12. The question is, say you have 1 CBO at $1k/day and you increase it to $3k/day during the day. If you keep resetting it back to $1k/day, you’re essentially capped, cause what if you kept it at $3k/day and the next day you reached $6k/day for example. 

How do you guys see and do it?
[8.10.25, 22:26:58] ~ Michael: thank
[8.10.25, 22:27:00] ~ Michael: s
[8.10.25, 22:31:31] ~ Fabian: I don’t reset

I just scale as hard down again only if roas is way lower than target, if roas is decent the morning after , I don’t scale down . If higher than target I keep surfing
[8.10.25, 22:39:53] ~ Guy Edan: Makes sense. Thanks

[9.10.25, 15:42:26] ~ Ry: For guys using funnelish, do u see alot of draft orders?
[9.10.25, 15:45:35] ~ Bryan T: Anyone dealt with annoying websites like scamadviser or scamdoc? They've climbed super high on our google search results and are flagging us for illegitimate reasons like "domain age" and "missing owner info"
[9.10.25, 15:56:10] ~ Mo: whats best ad library tool for ad spend estimation on meta ?
[9.10.25, 16:11:36] ~ VH0: Seen them too, don’t waste time arguing with them. Build up legit reviews on Trustpilot and Google, post PR articles and blog content with your brand name to push them down, and make sure your site shows real people and contact info.

They never hurt real conversions, actually they just look bad on Google until you bury them.
[9.10.25, 16:14:05] ~ OB: do you bump up the budget at midnight or doesn’t matter which time?

[13.10.25, 13:38:49] ~ Phil: Yes you use eleven labs for the voice overs
[13.10.25, 13:38:54] ~ Phil: Heygen to create the avatars

[13.10.25, 13:51:14] ~ Cocow: Lots of struggles and tests hahha

We ere doing one ADSET per concept on ABO

Now we are testing single campaign structure with minimum spend on adsets cause we still want to learn on new concepts and acquire data. But these new concepts have difficult times taking the spend so we might consider switching to ABO. Depends as well on the budget of your campaign ours is not that high s this might be the reason (or just bad new creatives hahah)
[13.10.25, 13:59:55] ~ Bazeed: If youre usijg heygen you need the Avatar IV to be turned on to make it realistic. Othering it only has lipsync. 

Arcads is also very realistic if you clone avatar

[13.10.25, 14:36:24] ~ Marlon Martinez: So you can use all your settings and voices from EL

[13.10.25, 15:43:34] ~ Steve: Use ad manage AI
[13.10.25, 15:43:49] ~ Steve: Connect both accounts. 

Duplicate the campaigns and launch
[13.10.25, 15:44:34] ~ Steve: This is what we're using to launch ads now. Much faster.

And we're warming up new accounts which means moving winning ads from the old account to the new. Not as many as you're looking to do but still, makes things way easier

[14.10.25, 15:08:03] ~ Rustam: Guys, I have cpms of $150-250 in the US for a beauty product. Ads are pretty good (I have a nice variety with all custom content + spend millions on ads before) The total adspend on the account is $1400 so far, and cpm isn’t really decreasing. Do you feel like it will go down with time, or shall I try a new account? I have been only advertising in outdoors and sports industries and cpms there are usually $20 in the US ‎<This message was edited>
[14.10.25, 17:32:36] ~ Austin: Hey man, I had a friend go through this and once he started running more engaging ads that customers / fb liked and paired with completely erasing any ripped content from his PDP, CPM’s drop drastically

[15.10.25, 3:15:17] ~ Brandon: Hey guys, quick question- for those using a Chinese 3PL, roughly by what percentage did your shipping costs go up during Q4/BFCM last year? And do you have any predictions for how much they might increase this year? Just trying to get a general ballpark.
[15.10.25, 6:21:01] ~ Bazeed: Octane AI if youre on shopify, better than heyflow if youre on shopify

Would love to hear your feedback, we’re about to launch our supplement brand and looking for a solid fulfillment partner.
[16.10.25, 9:26:37] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Have you checked Amazon as 3PL? They are actually pretty good and the price is good if you do it right
[16.10.25, 9:27:53] ~ Bazeed: Nope, going to give it a look. Would you say they handle logistics better than a traditional US based 3pl
[16.10.25, 9:31:37] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Yes and no.

Is everything pretty straight forward, they ship within 2 days, sometimes they take a lot of time to unload everything if you sell also on Amazon and if is marked as delivered and the customer says is not true, they don’t help.

But pricing wise is pretty good and you sell FBA at the same time
[16.10.25, 9:31:49] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You can check mcf calculator to see prices
[16.10.25, 10:07:35] ~ Mo: anyone has some materials, videos or whatever that explains steps to generate realistic AI hygen avatars with Hygen and elevenlabs api ? first time generating an ai avatar.

[16.10.25, 16:30:21] ~ Kyle Twohill: download the video, go to elevenlabs click speech to text. Upload the video it will quickly transcribe the whole thing
[16.10.25, 17:16:37] ~ Mai: Is there any post purchase upsell app that supports multi market store? Aftersell doesn’t show the offers on a multi currency store
[16.10.25, 18:26:03] ~ VH0: Look at what people are searching, buying, nd talking about. Use tools like Google Trends and TikTok Creative Center. Check Amazon for proof people spend money on it. Throw up a test page, run like $1000 in ads or even less, and watch if clicks turn into carts

If it sells without you begging, youve found a winner

And oh, pls never use AI for this one. You’ll regret it. 🙂

 I’m curious on what approach you use currently. Any experiences are highly appreciated cause we’re struggling a bit last months
[18.10.25, 13:26:18] ~ Monaesh: We do 1 script with 4-8 hooks all targeting different audiences and it works well

[18.10.25, 13:36:10] ~ Fabian: If only klarna is deactivated might be because klarna banned you because risk % is to high

This is probably the reason, also doing klarna merchant contract won’t help. ‎<This message was edited>
[18.10.25, 13:37:29] ~ Fabian: Klarna can ban if dispute % is too high 

And they won’t put reserve when Shopify is the middleman , they will either accept you or not ‎<This message was edited>
[18.10.25, 13:38:10] ~ Yusuf: Yeah we fucked up for sure
[18.10.25, 13:38:57] ~ Fabian: Well the thing is, even if you solve the dispute before it becomes chargeback. Customer is happy and everything, if the dispute rate from the beginning is to high klarna does this
[18.10.25, 13:40:05] ~ Gideon: Oké. Great. So just first hook is different. Rest is similar? And same ad type?
[18.10.25, 13:41:11] ~ Yusuf: Yeah we had a bad dispute rate last Q4 so they gave us like a 10% reserve but it got lifted after we improved it, that’s why i was confused that they seemingly banned us completely this time
[18.10.25, 13:42:21] ~ Cocow: We moved from ABO testing to CBO testing with minim spend on adsets to still « test » 

We were abo pros but we really had to change the ad account structure cause it was doing worse and worse
[18.10.25, 13:48:33] ~ Fabian: Yes Shopify can give reserve but klarna is wont
[18.10.25, 13:48:49] ~ Fabian: Unless you have direct contract with klarna
[18.10.25, 14:00:19] ~ Mikael: anyone have any REP or contact within Klarna to signup for Klarna merchant?
[18.10.25, 17:32:23] ~ Michael: does anyone use airwallex paypal wallet for shopify ? if yes, how did u integrate it
[18.10.25, 18:27:39] ~ Mat: Its only for LLC's I think
[18.10.25, 21:06:15] ~ Ben Mansour: When I have an ad doing very well in abo and I take it to cbo (post id) it performs bad and doesn‘t scale in the cbo, anyone noticed same?
[18.10.25, 21:17:26] ~ AK: I had same issue whenever I created any new campaign CBO or cost caps or just dups of ABO it didn’t do good
[18.10.25, 21:17:47] ~ AK: Now for one of my store i only have one abo campaign and just scale each winner adset vertically
[18.10.25, 21:18:21] ~ AK: I am at 4k daily spend rn for that ad account and it’s working great
[18.10.25, 21:19:34] ~ AK: Is there anyway to workout this 7 business days delay on Shopify payouts from new update? Been crazy
[18.10.25, 21:20:10] ~ AK: Or it improves with time? I just needed to create new shopify because old ones were banned and all payouts are delayed by 7 business days
[18.10.25, 23:52:29] ~ Omar: whos got a swipe file of the best UGC ads they have seen
[18.10.25, 23:53:49] ~ Omar: if u have im building a project to spit out realistic ugc videos can send that to u
[19.10.25, 9:31:14] ~ Mo: do u guys have funnelish pay enabled in funnelish checkout ?
[19.10.25, 11:52:52] ~ Mat: Yeah

[19.10.25, 16:51:01] ~ K: Anybody know a good cheap CPA for HK company’s? I’m in dying need for one
[19.10.25, 16:51:35] ~ Alexander Lundberg: CPA?
[19.10.25, 16:53:30] ~ Mo: same here bro
[19.10.25, 17:40:04] ~ K: Yes sir
[19.10.25, 17:40:27] ~ K: Let me know if you find one as well haha
[19.10.25, 19:03:44] ~ Guy Edan: Do thank you page upsells from aftersell convert well for you guys? what % is considered good?
[19.10.25, 23:03:19] ~ Omar: Has Shopify payments changed everyone’s payout to 7D?
[19.10.25, 23:04:36] ~ Fabian: Yes they change to 3days after a certain period

I guess this is to avoid people that abuse Shopify payments
[19.10.25, 23:04:51] ~ Omar: U kno how long ?
‎[19.10.25, 23:33:02] ~ Michael: ‎image omitted
[19.10.25, 23:34:32] ~ Phil: I know someone that makes them. What do you mean by CPA!
[19.10.25, 23:35:48] ~ M: Very hard to tell from here without more context tbf
[19.10.25, 23:38:30] ~ M: But:
- shipping cost
- ⁠shipping times (long, maybe not clear?)
- ⁠not utilising scarcity
- ⁠trust
- ⁠best usps visible in the checkout
- ⁠smaller things like maybe button copy/colour(contrast)

Alot of people also don’t realise a  lot of the convincing happens before they even get to checkout but you said you guys fixed that so didn’t really want to mention
[19.10.25, 23:38:40] ~ M: What i can think of from the top of my head ‎<This message was edited>
[19.10.25, 23:39:23] ~ M: Especially depending on audience age the scarcity in checkout usually is a big one
[19.10.25, 23:40:18] ~ Michael: thanks, but everything is fixed you mentioned. usually our droprates are 15-10-5 but in this case we dont know whats happening. optimizing since weeks. audience. male 25-60 bueatuy product 55$ aov
[19.10.25, 23:44:43] ~ M: I see
[19.10.25, 23:44:46] ~ M: Makes sense
[19.10.25, 23:45:21] ~ M: Tbh in that case if thats like an audience issue, id literally survey via email/call them up etc
[19.10.25, 23:45:31] ~ M: If it seems like nothing works
[19.10.25, 23:45:47] ~ M: It could be a common theme between this specific customer base that could even be a simple fix
[19.10.25, 23:48:24] ~ Michael: thanks bro, Just a simple email asking what almost stopped them from buying, or a short general survey?
[19.10.25, 23:49:16] ~ M: Yeah literally what stopped them from buying and tbh any other questions u have especially if you maybe tie an incentive to it
[19.10.25, 23:50:25] ~ M: I also havent tried this yet but i have had someone mention to me screen recordings/heatmap on checkout pages with microsoft clarity apparently does work

But i haven’t verified myself yet so but something to potentially look into
[19.10.25, 23:54:33] Topi: I have
[19.10.25, 23:54:37] ~ Fabian: My friend got 3 days after 2 weeks

[20.10.25, 16:58:06] ~ Aline Couto: Has anyone tried that Creator Marketplace on Meta? I'm using a UGC agency in Brazil and noticed some of the girls are listed there. I ran an open campaign and got over 100 interested people, but most of them seem scammy. Has anyone had a good experience?
[20.10.25, 17:50:10] ~ Mikael: Have any of your suppliers started to increase prices allready? stating Yun have increased their delivery cost?
[20.10.25, 18:10:23] ~ Alexander: They told me they will increase it every week until the end of November
[20.10.25, 18:12:29] ~ Rick: Yo guys, I have a question; we are limited to the amount of adsets we can launch on a fb page, I believe it is only 75 adsets. We burn through these numbers of adsets quite fast, and we have to set up new facebook pages every few weeks. This is a hassle, because we have almost 30 pages, and everytime we have to disconnect our instagram page and connect it to the new one, which also makes comment moderation on IG literally impossible for ads on older pages (you can only moderate when it is connected). Any idea what to do here?
[20.10.25, 18:27:31] ~ AK: How do we check adset/ad limit for page?
[20.10.25, 18:27:40] ~ AK: I had no idea regarding this
[20.10.25, 18:30:18] ~ Rick: It just says that you have reached the limit
[20.10.25, 18:37:17] ~ Monaesh: We don’t have any limit? Maybe check with Meta support
[20.10.25, 18:44:38] ~ AK: you mean on ad account you get error and can’t publish ads?

so as long as we don’t get any error it’s good to use same page?
[20.10.25, 18:53:51] ~ Rick: In ads manager yes
[20.10.25, 19:22:43] ~ AK: ok thanks

[20.10.25, 20:35:16] ~ Steve: Yes, esp if it's newer fb account we've had this issue on new accounts

One day I get above 2 roas with good AOV.

Next day AOV drops by $8-9 then roas drops to like 1.5-1.6 as well.

CVR has been same, and other ad metrics like CPM, CPC and CTR has been pretty much same as well.
[21.10.25, 14:51:03] ~ Monaesh: This will happen at low spend. look at data over a 7 day period
[21.10.25, 15:05:57] ~ AK: Okay, I am at like around 5k daily spend, is it considered low spend or high?

Only facing this for one brand 

when killing ads I look at 7 days 

Thanks for advice tho
[21.10.25, 15:06:46] ~ Monaesh: 5k should be enough to be stable. Could just be seasonality then?

In my experience BC makes way more sense and scales (in terms of profitibality) the same and more stable than Cost Caps

[27.10.25, 18:57:50] ~ Rick: 30 to 50%
[27.10.25, 18:57:56] ~ Rick: after 60 to 80%
[27.10.25, 19:28:19] ~ Marin: it also depends if you mention price or not on the Listicle
if you don’t, a lot of them clicks just to check the price, but CR ends up being lower
[27.10.25, 19:47:32] ~ Omar: Are you guys adding any filter to ur ai generated videos 

To make it look more realistic?

Like playing with the contrast brightness etc etc
[27.10.25, 20:35:56] ~ Fabian: Sometimes, I can reduce quality slightly. For me slightly reduced quality can make it look more “home made” rather than ai

[27.10.25, 21:18:29] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey dark lords

Any of you guys currently NOT running SMS for cart recovery?

Been diving deep into a backend optimization lately and wanted to share what's been working. TxtCart is my #1 tool rn. Massive ROI.

If you guys have email but no SMS with BFCM around the corner you are losing $10,000s. This is the easiest money you will make in Q4.

If you guys want to check them out they have a free trial + you only pay if it performs.

[28.10.25, 1:09:04] ~ Wouter: Having some big discussions with my media buyer😂
[28.10.25, 1:15:15] ~ Tariq: depdends what you're working on, just CBO testing with minimum spend works as well, and have another CBO just for scaling winners and some costcaps/ bid caps optional, but I'd just make it simple and focus more creative testing and scaling/killing

We have reviewed the information you have provided and were unable to confirm the infringing use of the trademark you have reported in the geography specified in your notice. As such, we will not be taking action on your notice at this time.”? ‎<This message was edited>

[28.10.25, 16:48:04] ~ Filippo: People using Gethookd, Atria, or Foreplay…how do you swipe an ad if you dont have certainty it’s a winner since these tools don’t show the engagement?
[28.10.25, 16:56:39] ~ Guy Edan: That’s my issue with these tools also. I use gethookd but to confirm what ads are winners I use adspy. I think it’s the only true way to see what ads were successful
[28.10.25, 16:57:16] ~ Rick: bm spy and you are 100% sure

[28.10.25, 17:05:32] ~ Ben Mansour: And see which of their ads have the highest engagement
[28.10.25, 17:05:34] ~ Filippo: yeah i know how to use the tool

[28.10.25, 17:06:42] ~ Filippo: Once you find the ad

Both stores at 7-8k daily spend rn.
[29.10.25, 11:02:51] ~ AK: Also any insights on how we can approach this?

If old winners that has been getting most spend on CBO have been performing bad for whole 7 days do you turn it off?
[29.10.25, 11:37:06] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Anyone got good UGC creators for weight loss & health? 🙏🏼
[29.10.25, 11:42:41] ~ Garo Antossian: Hey man! Yeah in those cases I usually don’t turn off the old winners right away. What’s been working for me is cutting the budget by at least 50%, sometimes even more, and letting the campaigns run a couple more days to stabilize. I’ve actually revived performance a few times by just lowering the spend instead of killing the campaign completely. It helps avoid the reset and still gives the algo room to optimize again.

[30.10.25, 19:10:12] ~ Lucas : !!! 😅
[30.10.25, 19:20:57] ~ Mike Ramsey: Extra context on this - 

The registered agent is only for registering your business at the state level, collecting docs and filing,etc and are not affiliated with your business beyond that.  They would not be considered a company employee who would  sign or be authorized to set up Tik-Tok Shop or any other financial services and products.

You would need an IBO or hire someone for your company that’s a US citizen with SSN that has some sort of connection to your business.
[30.10.25, 19:21:59] ~ Chris: That's what I thought.

What's an IBO?
[30.10.25, 19:24:37] ~ Prabhat: Hi @⁨~Chris⁩ you can also go with ~ https://www.delawareregisteredagent.com they setup yr LLC & get yr EIN pretty fast. And then heads up for yr fin-tech banking (mercury ~ my opinion) and you good to go. And the best thing: these guys also take care of yr state filings and everything. ‎<This message was edited>
[30.10.25, 19:25:53] ~ Chris: I'm using doola at the moment for the LLC and EIN.
Although the EIN seems to take fucking ages.

However, as @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ mentioned, I don't think those details will pass the US citizen verification for US TikTok shop.

Now i need to change ownership, and they also put 1000$ startup capital without asking us. I wanna know if we’ll have to deposit that capital in our first bank account for the new company or no

[30.10.25, 19:52:11] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Sorry for the delay - here’s a guide

The tools I use are ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Nano Banana.
The key to getting consistent, high-quality images is to first build a moodboard that defines the vibe you want. Start by collecting reference images - either your own or from Pinterest - that match your desired look.

Once that’s done, upload them to Midjourney and create a moodboard.

Next, I go into ChatGPT with a sample image I like and ask it to write a JSON prompt describing the setting, angle, lighting, and product placement in the photo. The trick here is to let Midjourney generate a placeholder object for the product. I also make small adjustments if I want extra details.

Then I take this prompt into Midjourney, making sure it’s generated using the moodboard I created.
I let Midjourney generate images until I find one I like - if the moodboard is good, it’s usually spot on.

Finally, I bring the image into Nano Banana. I upload the Midjourney image with the placeholder, then attach a second image of my product (must have a transparent background). I use a prompt like: “Replace the object in the first picture with the exact object from the second.”

Finally, I take the finished image from Nano Banana into Photoshop to remove the watermark and add any text or final touches.

I’ve got an old friend who runs an agency specializing in this - I’m sure he’d love to take some of you on!

Wishing you all the best of luck for Q4! - If you need any help my DMs are open.

[30.10.25, 21:16:33] ~ Chris: Exactly the same

We have a pretty old US shopify.
It has a World First account connected (which is no longer allowed).
Which was no issue. However, shopify supports solution was to reconnect the bank account
[30.10.25, 21:18:03] ~ Chris: Tried that because I want ma $.

Exactly like you are saying
[30.10.25, 21:19:30] ~ Chris: Some shit about it being a virtual bank account
[30.10.25, 21:20:05] ~ Chris: "Our banking partners reviewed the logs and found that the bank account you’re trying to use is a virtual bank account configured to receive payments in the IAT (International ACH Transaction) format. 
 
Shopify only supports domestic ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions for U.S. bank accounts. Because of this, any account that requires IAT will fail validation when you try to add or update it, and the system will block it."
[30.10.25, 21:20:13] ~ Chris: "I understand you’ve used this account for many years without issue. Unfortunately, we can’t bypass this system-level restriction. To proceed, you’ll need to use a U.S. bank account that supports standard domestic ACH transactions."
[30.10.25, 21:20:14] ~ Mikael: Ah okey. So its for US llc?
[30.10.25, 21:20:28] ~ Chris: Not really.

But I can't pump more into Meta. It's unprofitable with the rising CPMs

[30.10.25, 23:27:06] ~ Chris: Don't really know.
Would be good to have something to blame though lol
[30.10.25, 23:27:16] ~ Wouter: But why all of a sudden?
[30.10.25, 23:27:22] ~ Wouter: Like it’s been good for the whole year
[30.10.25, 23:27:33] ~ Chris: ^
[30.10.25, 23:27:38] ~ Wouter: Last 3 days - 3 brands stopped performing
[30.10.25, 23:27:47] ~ Chris: Yeah I got nothing for that :/
[30.10.25, 23:30:36] ~ OB: 0.7% down 30% from last year
[30.10.25, 23:31:03] ~ Wouter: But the last 3 days?

[31.10.25, 1:01:27] ~ Aamir Latif: Hey guys 
Anyone have any experience with installing wetracked for meta ads ? 

I installed it and my entire performance crashed. Even after deleting still performance is shit !
[31.10.25, 1:03:11] ~ Gigi: Works fine with me ‎<This message was edited>
[31.10.25, 1:03:36] ~ Gigi: But it tracks double atc
[31.10.25, 1:10:53] ~ Alexander: when does it make sense to upgrade to shopify plus? How many orders and revenue/month?
[31.10.25, 1:11:21] ~ Chris: Pretty sure it doesn't anymore. 
I think the fee scales
[31.10.25, 1:12:16] ~ SA: Yep I had a store in this niche as well. It was ripping well but then it died down lmao
[31.10.25, 1:12:46] ~ SA: Is it still worth testing brand new stores this month? what does every one think about this?
[31.10.25, 1:22:39] ~ Omar: how long does heygen take to make a 2min video for u guys
[31.10.25, 1:29:40] ~ James Moffat: 100%
[31.10.25, 1:38:06] ~ A: I think you have to turn some tracking off in shopify for meta because wetracked is already tracking
[31.10.25, 2:53:06] ~ Gigi: I have sticky cart I think it’s for this
[31.10.25, 2:55:27] ~ Gigi: Anyway guys , I’m around 2/3k day in eu market but I’m struggling a lot to UK/USA market (100% for creatives ) . Any advice for starting make good numbers in English market , expecially USA ? Real money are there , you can bring any product to 20/30 day and exit quickly , in EU is a shit , also for VAT even payment processing is easier and no holds
[31.10.25, 2:56:44] ~ Alamin: What industry? I'm based in UK so can potentially share insight.
[31.10.25, 2:57:01] ~ Gigi: Also because with editors , is to much easier find A+ player with low tariffs , in eu with native language is a shit
[31.10.25, 2:57:12] ~ Gigi: Beauty niche
[31.10.25, 2:57:51] ~ Gigi: Tested there my currently product , 1.6 first week then “””died””” 2 weeks ago
[31.10.25, 2:58:05] ~ Gigi: I want to sell only in English markets , EU is shit
[31.10.25, 2:59:12] ~ Gigi: +40/45 audience 
Cpm 50 usd 
Cpc 1.20/1.30
All TOF ads 
(NO KALORIP) b-rolls&ai voice
[31.10.25, 3:00:49] ~ Alamin: Where are you shipping from? I personally think US/UK markets are especially sensitive to delivery speed.

Customers in the UK are quite sensitive to importing in from abroad given import charges etc, especially since we left EU. 

Competition is also more fierce here in UK and also imagine in the US too.

If you're already serving English-speaking countries, I don't imagine creatives to change much for beauty?
[31.10.25, 3:01:51] ~ Gigi: I ship from chins but is not a problem
[31.10.25, 3:02:18] ~ Gigi: In the checkout I explain that it takes 5/8 working days
[31.10.25, 3:02:58] ~ Alamin: I think your biggest incremental impact would be getting that to 1-3 working days
[31.10.25, 3:03:11] ~ Alamin: (obviously without having had insight into anything else)
[31.10.25, 3:03:28] ~ Gigi: I don’t think so
[31.10.25, 3:03:31] ~ Alamin: Amazon has massively changed consumer behaviour here imo (not a new trend, but increasingly so)
[31.10.25, 3:03:38] ~ Gigi: 90% people ship from china
[31.10.25, 3:04:35] ~ Alamin: Try a/b test to just see incremental lift

2-3 working days, shipped via Royal Mail (familiarity) 

Up to you how you want to test this :)
[31.10.25, 3:04:55] ~ Gigi: Sure
[31.10.25, 3:06:04] ~ Alamin: And if it does justify bulk ordering to UK and despatching from here, let me know and I'll put you in touch with our 3PL we use. They're brilliant
[31.10.25, 3:07:39] ~ Gigi: Thank you! How much you pay more the cog with a uk 3PL?
[31.10.25, 3:08:00] ~ Alamin: UK 3pls are a lot cheaper than US
[31.10.25, 3:08:15] ~ Alamin: We pay £1.30 per order packed
[31.10.25, 3:08:27] ~ Gigi: Yes but in % , what’s the difference with china cost?
[31.10.25, 3:08:35] ~ Gigi: You understand what I mean ?
[31.10.25, 3:08:44] ~ Bryan T: I assume you’d test this with just messaging in checkout?
[31.10.25, 3:09:30] ~ Alamin: So for UK, you can do £3.80 (roughly) + £1.30 for... delivery + fulfilment
[31.10.25, 3:09:57] ~ Alamin: …+ per unit delivered to UK in bulk from China
[31.10.25, 3:10:03] ~ Alamin: Vs. straight shipping from China
[31.10.25, 3:10:13] ~ Gigi: So a 15/20% more
[31.10.25, 3:10:25] ~ Alamin: How much do you pay to ship straight from China?
[31.10.25, 3:10:43] ~ Alamin: Yes, guess so, but whether you can fulfil on the messaging is a different question lol
[31.10.25, 3:10:45] ~ Gigi: It depends
[31.10.25, 3:11:07] ~ Gigi: 5$ usd
[31.10.25, 3:11:18] ~ Gigi: On the main product
[31.10.25, 3:12:08] ~ Alamin: Interesting...
[31.10.25, 3:12:16] ~ Gigi: Yeah
[31.10.25, 3:12:17] ~ Alamin: Do think it's worth testing though
[31.10.25, 3:12:41] ~ Gigi: Shipping in uk are very good
[31.10.25, 3:12:48] ~ Gigi: Lower
[31.10.25, 3:12:54] ~ Gigi: 60% than USA
[31.10.25, 3:13:48] ~ Alamin: If you do test it, do let us know. curious to know results lol

Happy to put you in touch (and anyone else) with the founder directly

[31.10.25, 15:42:08] ~ Frederik Damian McDowell: Legendary numbers man Respect and congrats on the success. Not doing those numbers but really curious to hear your experience and learnings through the different levels
[31.10.25, 15:42:16] ~ Tomer Bachar 🇺🇸/🇮🇱: What do you think guys about this idea 

each of us can share a quick tip or insight about the countries where we’re running large ad budgets. Specifically, things like unique cultural or social nuances that really affect performance.

For example:
• In South Korea, you should never use the gesture 🤏🏽 it’s considered rude.
• Across much of Asia, it’s often better to use Korean models, since they’re perceived as aspirational.
• ⁠In Brazil, e-commerce can be challenging because every online purchase requires a CPF (digital ID number), which often limits conversions or complicates the checkout process. ‎<This message was edited>
[31.10.25, 15:44:08] ~ OB: damn man you’re doing better numbers than someone like Andy Frisella himself, what’s the secret???
[31.10.25, 15:45:10] ~ Giovanni: Not very good, if you want to do big numbers you need cash on delivery
[31.10.25, 15:45:53] ~ Giovanni: For younger audience would probably be ok but you definitely need to translate if you want to scale
[31.10.25, 15:45:58] ~ Frederik Damian McDowell: Damn, there were some guys at ESS miami doing 200m€ a year in eastern europe with cash on delivery

[31.10.25, 21:54:24] ~ Giovanni: Guys, I have a question for those of you that are making good numbers in Dropshipping: how do you deal with the fact that you’re not the actual shipper of the package and so you can’t for example change address once it’s shipped, or if the person put a wrong building number you can’t just tell the courier to fix it and redelivery? 

Or maybe it’s possible but it’s just my supplier… I’m shipping in Italy, using YunExpress
[31.10.25, 22:02:23] ~ Alexander Lundberg: From my experience, it’s not possible - even when we had our own warehouse and logistics setup, we still couldn’t change the address once an order had shipped. It’s ultimately the customer’s responsibility, and your policy should reflect that.
[31.10.25, 22:03:09] ~ Giovanni: Yeah of course, thank you man
[31.10.25, 22:17:32] ~ James Moffat: Instead of returns, try and get them to agree to something like a 20% refund first + keeping the product, explain that it would cost a lot of money for the shipping label for the return and so they may as well accept that.
[31.10.25, 22:25:25] ~ Giovanni: I’ll try that thank you 🙏🏻
[31.10.25, 22:43:12] ~ Michael: guys if you run different countries (different languages) do you use different pixel or the same?
[31.10.25, 23:26:31] ~ Lukas: Different pixel
[31.10.25, 23:28:13] ~ Michael: thanks
[31.10.25, 23:39:05] ~ James Moffat: Why?
[31.10.25, 23:40:33] ~ POVILAS: ENGLISH all to all countries
[31.10.25, 23:40:36] ~ POVILAS: and let it rip
[31.10.25, 23:40:46] ~ POVILAS: thats for pinterest and fb ads
[31.10.25, 23:40:48] ~ POVILAS: worked just fine
[31.10.25, 23:41:38] ~ Lukas: Its from my experience running ads in eastern europe countries. 
I used different pixels because performance data and behavior vary a lot between countries ( different languages, currencies, and conversion patterns)…. so separated pixels helped me keep the optimization cleaner and make retargeting and lookalikes more accurate for each market.
[31.10.25, 23:42:07] ~ POVILAS: just have a banner with more specific to the country itself
[31.10.25, 23:42:11] ~ POVILAS: “free ship to norway”
[31.10.25, 23:42:13] ~ POVILAS: or smth like this
[31.10.25, 23:48:51] ~ James Moffat: Fair enough, thank you
[1.11.25, 0:03:07] ~ m: Smart
[1.11.25, 2:11:01] ~ Miloš Landauer: Hey, my friend who works at Google is building an AI that creates custom email flows for each customer based on post purchase survey data. It uses factors like age, gender, and location to design a unique email flow that boosts retention and LTV.

He’s looking for a few stores that would be willing to try it out for free so he can refine the product. If you’re interested, send me a text and I’ll connect you!
[1.11.25, 2:11:06] ~ Ben Mansour: Anyone knows a good facebook developer to help with pixel / tracking issues?
[1.11.25, 10:20:45] ~ Gideon: I know one
[1.11.25, 10:29:34] ~ fer: Hey everyone does anyone know, or have a contact who sells EU verified TikTok Shop account?

[1.11.25, 14:04:48] ~ Giovanni: Guys, where do you put the BFSM teaser, the fucking button they can click if they want to subscribe and get the discount. I used to just show the pop up and if they were closing it they couldn’t open it again so I keep everything clean. But maybe for this one is better to show it

[1.11.25, 16:09:29] ~ Giovanni: Does someone use brandwise for customer support other than hiding and answering automatically to FB and IG comments ?
[1.11.25, 16:16:53] ~ MR: Banger app, i use it
[1.11.25, 16:17:18] ~ MR: I just have my VA having a look from time to time, but you can set up to auto reply to people
[1.11.25, 16:18:39] ~ Giovanni: Thank you ! Gonna train my VA then
[1.11.25, 16:18:47] ~ Ben Mansour: I use it as well
[1.11.25, 16:18:59] ~ Ben Mansour: Customer supoort team takes care of it
[1.11.25, 16:19:23] ~ MR: My VA deals with the most basics stuff, if she doesnt know she figures it out and confirms with me
[1.11.25, 16:19:57] ~ Giovanni: Yeah that’s the proper behaviour
[1.11.25, 16:20:15] ~ Ben Mansour: Is anyone here using trackbee?

[1.11.25, 16:43:41] ~ Guy Edan: Surf scaling - 25-30% every 2-3 hours or send it an double the budget? What works best for u guys
[1.11.25, 16:47:37] ~ Omar: Has anyone setup a Claude project that spits out good UGC scripts ?
[1.11.25, 18:05:04] ~ Austin: Hey guys, how do you find actors in my local city. Is there a website or app or software that you know of where I can find them? Have you ever tried Facebook groups? Just wondering how I can get as much diversity into this account as fast as possible and in person recording seems like the best way to go.
[1.11.25, 18:21:01] ~ Yuanda: Have you checked out Backstage
[1.11.25, 19:20:51] ~ Dominik Olszewski: Finding local video/ad producer can be a good option they have ton of contacts
[1.11.25, 19:25:22] ~ Alvaro De Prada: Hello guys for all of you that run subscription brands, how do you separate subscription renewals from new direct-response sales when analyzing ad performance on Triple Whale? What attribution settings do you use in order to have a clear understanding of daily ads performance?
I want a clear daily view of revenue driven only by today’s ads.
[1.11.25, 19:28:27] ~ Sairaj: I surf by 20-30% if results are good

Double if results are above the usual average 

Reset at 11:59pm ad acc time 

Working well on multiple accounts for me atm:)
[1.11.25, 19:32:44] ~ Alin Stan: For me, surfing performs best over the weekend, around 10–15% every few hours, as long as performance remains consistent. I don’t reset the budget, but I do scale down over the following days if needed.
[1.11.25, 19:38:13] ~ Lukas: Got the same question!!
[1.11.25, 19:57:37] ~ -J: Can view that in reports on shopify
[1.11.25, 21:31:44] ~ Felix: Does anyone in here has experience with Rokt Thanks & can we actually expect additional revenue?
[1.11.25, 21:33:03] ~ Chris: we use Rebuy Monetize, which is similar
‎[1.11.25, 21:33:13] ~ Chris: ‎image omitted
[1.11.25, 21:40:08] ~ Danny: I was earning $100 - 200/month on Rokt back when I was doing 30 - 40k/month
[1.11.25, 21:43:35] ~ Felix: Hm - doesn't sound that good x)
[1.11.25, 21:45:29] ~ Chris: free money 🤷‍♂
[1.11.25, 21:45:39] ~ Chris: depending on order volume, can be decent
[1.11.25, 21:46:26] ~ MR: Yep, i was getting like 600-700$ payouts from them, but i dont remember from what amount of monthly revenue, my partner deals with it
[1.11.25, 21:47:09] ~ MR: Pays out subscriptions at least😅
[1.11.25, 22:19:25] ~ Giovanni: Is it Shopify Plus only? I can’t find it in my Aftersell app
[1.11.25, 22:20:49] ~ N: is anyone using gem pages for there PDP and for checkout funnelish?
[1.11.25, 22:21:18] ~ Chris: The rebuy one definitely doesn't need plus
[1.11.25, 22:35:21] ~ Giovanni: I mean Rockt Thanks, I can’t find it hahah
[1.11.25, 22:36:13] ~ Felix: https://www.aftersell.com/rokt-thanks
[1.11.25, 22:37:24] ~ Gigi: No sense
[1.11.25, 22:38:40] ~ Gigi: For guys that use paypal wallet with Shopify payments , do you know any apps like disputifier for prevent chargeback? I have like 1.8% chargeback rate with 1.5k orders monthly
[1.11.25, 22:38:45] ~ Jesper: Someone in here that knows a freelancer or video editor who can make AI videos with AI voice over and just content from the internet instead of custom UGC
[1.11.25, 22:39:52] ~ N: Wym?

Using gem pages and on that product page the checkout buttons will go to funnelish checkout
[1.11.25, 22:43:27] ~ Gigi: With funnelish you can do same thing , even better
[1.11.25, 22:43:42] ~ N: Yeah but my funnel already on gem page
[1.11.25, 22:43:52] ~ N: Was tryna avoid getting someone to make it on funnelish
[1.11.25, 22:44:22] ~ Gigi: You can delegate it for 150/200 usd
[1.11.25, 22:49:20] ~ Giovanni: I already use After sell but I don’t see thanks, probably my bad
[1.11.25, 22:53:12] ~ Felix: Don't see it either - will probably book a call with them
[2.11.25, 1:19:18] ~ Guy Edan: If someone writes a comment on ur vid ad “fake AI”, do u respond in any way or just hide these comments?
[2.11.25, 1:20:57] ~ Chris: Add it to the auto hide list.
[2.11.25, 1:21:19] ~ Guy Edan: Mind sharing how do u do that?
[2.11.25, 1:21:51] ~ Kyle Tseng: in instagram account settings
[2.11.25, 1:22:32] ~ Chris: and also on facebook page.
[2.11.25, 1:22:51] ~ Chris: Ask chat gpt
[2.11.25, 1:22:55] ~ Chris: That cunt knows so much
[2.11.25, 2:34:41] ~ Susana: Meta question: When sharing a pixel from one ad account to another, is it normal to see a drop in performance? Going on 3rd day of migrating to an agency ad account and I haven’t touched my store, yet mi CVR dropped from 3-4% to 1%
[2.11.25, 2:39:35] ~ Chris: From my experience agencies ruin everything they touch.
[2.11.25, 2:46:14] ~ m: Guys anyone got swipe file for founder’s story ads. Or recommend any brands to look at. Thanks
[2.11.25, 3:01:13] ~ Dryden Byrd: Shakti used to do a bunch
[2.11.25, 3:51:17] ~ MR: yes a bit can affect, ujually its a few days

[2.11.25, 4:30:49] ~ Mo: guys once u set up your heyflow, where/how do u add product page link at last step of the funnel to redirect people to your pdp ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2.11.25, 4:35:59] ~ Yuanda: The last step yes exactly
[2.11.25, 4:36:07] ~ Yuanda: Underneath the results of the quiz
[2.11.25, 4:37:03] ~ Mo: cant see where can i drop a dm bro ?
[2.11.25, 4:37:20] ~ Mo: @⁨~Yuanda⁩
[2.11.25, 4:37:37] ~ Yuanda: Yessir
[2.11.25, 6:20:32] ~ SA: Damn they're still scaling I see
[2.11.25, 6:23:53] ~ SA: Also guys, do you guys have any upcoming / established brands worth sharing to study from (any niche)?

Here's a few:

Colonbroom / Bioma (same owner - gut health space)

OneCompress 

Hike Footwear

Carpe

kallistia

Happy Mammoth
[2.11.25, 6:25:38] ~ SA: Space Goods / Ryze / Everyday Dose
Simply Nootropics
Try Spartan
[2.11.25, 6:25:43] ~ Mohit Uppal: Would love to get a hold of these as well!
[2.11.25, 8:53:00] ~ Lukas: What works for me is uploading a PPE campaign with like 50 duplicated ads of a dog and a text saying ‘like if you love dogs’.

And then at the same time you go to the winning and and edit a letter from the primary text (for ex u can add an extra dot or something)

This genuely worked idk why, i think that as Meta sees 50 ads getting approved, they approve the winning one too. So i recommend uploading that dog campaign daily, and turning off the previous day one haha.
[2.11.25, 9:23:44] ~ Mohit Uppal: Won’t you end up losing all social proof? If meta treats it as a new ad
[2.11.25, 9:25:01] ~ Lukas: You can just let them get approved and then turn them off
[2.11.25, 9:50:17] ~ Olly STFD: Seen a lot of whales getting paid into HK accounts. What’s the benefits of this?
[2.11.25, 9:52:28] ~ Olly STFD: Yes, you need to create foundational docs to train it. Look up Alex cooper and mark builds brands on YouTube - they both use this strategy
[2.11.25, 9:54:25] ~ Olly STFD: When are you asking for the review and do you incentivise in any way? It’s all about timing and what’s in it for them. You also want as little friction as possible rather than asking them to jump through multiple hoops - this means ideally allowing them to leave the review inside an embedded form in the email itself. Reduce clicks and you increase CVR
[2.11.25, 9:57:16] ~ Olly STFD: Look up sub magic
[2.11.25, 9:58:36] ~ Olly STFD: Spacegoods founder ad has been running 1-2 years and they still make iterations monthly
[2.11.25, 9:59:14] ~ Olly STFD: Look into getting an agency account
[2.11.25, 10:00:42] ~ Olly STFD: You’re asking for trouble with hacks like this. Not a long term play or solution and could cause more issues
[2.11.25, 10:02:29] ~ m: Thanks man
[2.11.25, 10:03:45] ~ Chris: Anyone spending 6 figures a month on meta without a 3rd party reporting tool like triple whale or North beam?
[2.11.25, 10:04:12] ~ R: Im doing founders ads myself for my brand you can dm me if you want to talk about it
[2.11.25, 10:06:40] ~ Matt: 2nd this if anyone knows a brand that does it well
[2.11.25, 10:27:22] ~ Mo Ecom: Yes that’s right

Lots of benefits especially with taxes, bulletproof accounts, dedicated reps, no reserves 

I have seen multiple 7 8 even 9 figure brands using these HK accounts to process payments
[2.11.25, 10:28:02] ~ Olly STFD: Can I get an intro pls?
[2.11.25, 10:28:35] ~ Mo Ecom: Sure let me connect you
[2.11.25, 10:29:14] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Also interested!

[2.11.25, 11:07:35] ~ MR: Can i get connected too?
[2.11.25, 11:08:00] ~ Mo Ecom: Sure thing

[2.11.25, 12:05:35] ~ MR: tryzeria.com



My main competitor, he knows what he is doing
[2.11.25, 12:06:03] ~ MR: Meant to reply to this
[2.11.25, 12:06:59] ~ Growg: Yeah, I have a my CRO guy, they can help you in building this.
[2.11.25, 13:49:30] ~ Olly STFD: Other long term winners are ovrload creatine gummies and rotten gummy worms
[2.11.25, 13:50:09] ~ Alamin: Hihi guys. We've been running campaigns with all target countries, but curious if you guys run separate campaigns for different countries?
[2.11.25, 13:51:30] ~ MR: I run top 4 and if all good then i run an EU one
[2.11.25, 13:52:12] ~ MR: Worked well for me
[2.11.25, 13:52:28] ~ Alamin: What country's top 4 for you?
[2.11.25, 13:53:35] ~ Olly STFD: UK, USA, Canada, Australia
[2.11.25, 13:53:52] ~ Alamin: ok cool. exactly the same for us. I guess it's universal in our space? lol
[2.11.25, 13:54:11] ~ MR: Same
[2.11.25, 13:54:35] ~ MR: Sometimes i might remove USA and works just fine
[2.11.25, 13:55:08] ~ Alamin: Our EU performance is super weak. Especially recently
[2.11.25, 13:55:16] ~ Alamin: We have IOSS so import taxes etc covered
[2.11.25, 13:55:20] ~ Alamin: Shipping from UK
[2.11.25, 13:55:27] ~ Alamin: Language for Germany + France translated
[2.11.25, 13:55:39] ~ Alamin: Trying  to work out why CVR is so low (4x lower than top 4)
[2.11.25, 13:55:55] ~ MR: I seen great performance from Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, germany
[2.11.25, 13:56:14] ~ MR: EU is more skeptical to buy from what I noticed
[2.11.25, 13:57:01] ~ Alamin: We also do 3-day shipping into France too... and we know we have a market there
[2.11.25, 13:57:07] ~ MR: For those who run supps beware of this ingredient DHA , they detained 500 orders and was a pain in the ass to refund the customers
[2.11.25, 13:57:21] ~ Alamin: Yeah experienced this too
[2.11.25, 13:58:44] ~ Alamin: Wonder if anyone found success in making EU work well for them?
[2.11.25, 13:58:53] ~ Alamin: (and the steps taken)
[2.11.25, 14:30:02] ~ Cocow: If you market EU like US you are going to find really really hard times , and vice versa

- Skepticism 
- Trust is important 
- It is good to have specific payment processors 
- Scale is different you cannot be that agressive 
- ⁠Do not do crazy ads that just feel too much
- ⁠Make sure to use local creators , native voice overs ‎<This message was edited>
[2.11.25, 14:32:28] ~ oluwadamilare Joshua: I have someone that can help you on this
[2.11.25, 14:39:06] ~ Adrián: we are in the opposite, we know how to sell in EU but 0 success on top4 😵
[2.11.25, 14:43:08] ~ Fes: Yesterday launched ABO testing campaign and 31 ads, but campaign is active and did not spend anything, tried turning on and off but nothing. Duplicated it and launched again but still same issue. Just on some says active on some preparing and thats it. Do anyone know what could be a problem? I have other ad accounts and did not have this issue ever
[2.11.25, 14:43:11] Carlos Leeseman: Because you’re from Europe and you know the market. That’s why having a marketing manager / strategist is probably best way to go
[2.11.25, 14:43:27] ~ Alexander Lundberg: Scandinavia has worked very well for me
[2.11.25, 14:48:40] ~ Alamin: Thanks for this. Very helpful. Will look into these/keep them in mind

[2.11.25, 14:57:08] ~ Adrián: go to Business General Home page, maybe some ads with problems

[2.11.25, 17:27:11] ~ M: hi does anyone have templates for email flows
[2.11.25, 17:39:56] ~ A: Are you guys using agency accounts or a structure? I’ve always done agency accounts but thinking of getting a US LLC BM structure instead because I’m tired of paying 5% topup fees.

Curious about your experience with that
[2.11.25, 17:42:55] ~ N: Has anyone verified there Bm with hk and if they did 

Does it unlock like 250 ad accounts
[2.11.25, 17:54:50] ~ James Moffat: Does this actually work?
[2.11.25, 18:21:12] ~ A: I will hop on a call with someone who arranges these things in about an hour. Can let you know in about a week or two what my experience is with this
[2.11.25, 18:22:08] ~ James Moffat: Thanks mate, appreciate it! Because I’m in a similar position. Agency is better than buying BMs and stuff but if there’s an even better option then ..
[2.11.25, 18:38:13] ~ Michael: guys whats the best platform for ugc b roll library`
[2.11.25, 18:51:52] ~ MR: Im not that familiar with agency and buying BMs, whats the issue with them? 

Ive been using personal and all good lol, even using credit line and helps a ton with cashflow
[2.11.25, 18:53:18] ~ James Moffat: Agency works well it’s just if there was a way to not spend % on fees and also not get banned then it’s defo better!! 

How have you set that up without getting banned 😂
[2.11.25, 18:54:00] ~ MR: Spent this year around 700k$ 

And no issues lol
[2.11.25, 18:54:12] ~ James Moffat: Did you set up with LLC?
[2.11.25, 18:54:20] ~ MR: Canadian company
[2.11.25, 18:54:36] ~ James Moffat: Thanks 👍
[2.11.25, 18:54:41] ~ Omar: How many ad accounts did they allow you to have?
[2.11.25, 18:54:51] ~ MR: On my main BM i can do 10
[2.11.25, 18:55:08] ~ MR: And i have another BM on dubai company
[2.11.25, 18:55:17] ~ MR: And one back up
[2.11.25, 18:56:16] ~ SA: There’s agencies that charge 0% fees btw
[2.11.25, 18:56:33] ~ James Moffat: But monthly retainer Im assuming
[2.11.25, 18:56:45] ~ SA: Yeah it’s way smaller than the fees though
[2.11.25, 18:56:48] ~ James Moffat: Thanks is it a proper brand that you do or drop shipping?
[2.11.25, 18:56:51] ~ James Moffat: Adrevival?
[2.11.25, 18:56:56] ~ Omar: How much
[2.11.25, 18:57:00] ~ SA: Yes these guys
[2.11.25, 18:57:04] ~ James Moffat: They’re a bit shit though
[2.11.25, 18:57:12] ~ SA: In what way?
[2.11.25, 18:57:17] ~ James Moffat: took away 3 of my ad accounts with no warning
[2.11.25, 18:57:23] ~ SA: Their ad account quality?
[2.11.25, 18:57:26] ~ James Moffat: All with stores running that now I haven’t been able to make profitable
[2.11.25, 18:57:43] ~ James Moffat: On new ad accs I
[2.11.25, 18:57:47] ~ SA: Using their ad accounts?
[2.11.25, 18:57:47] ~ MR: Rn product is branded but still needs a lot of product development. Marketing is product aware at the moment
[2.11.25, 18:57:52] ~ James Moffat: Ye
[2.11.25, 18:58:15] ~ James Moffat: Cool thanks 👍 defo safer than dropshipping then for the BM
[2.11.25, 18:58:20] ~ SA: Honestly the best way is to make your own BM, and build your own ad accounts from scratch
[2.11.25, 18:58:30] ~ James Moffat: Yeah gunna do that rn
[2.11.25, 18:58:34] ~ MR: I agree
[2.11.25, 18:58:40] ~ SA: Like using brand new accounts but takes time to build trust with FB

[2.11.25, 21:35:00] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. After having our best day yesterday and 3x the budget (and lowering it back at 12am) today 90% of the budget was spent by now and it’s only middle of the day, and sales are down drastically.

What do you do when this happens to you? ‎<This message was edited>
[2.11.25, 22:47:21] ~ Ash: i think there was some delivery issues this morning too
[2.11.25, 23:13:17] ~ Sairaj: Yeah, noticed it overspent like crazy by mid day on a few accounts too
[2.11.25, 23:42:17] ~ Ben Mansour: Yes same
[2.11.25, 23:47:40] ~ Alamin: Does anyone have any data/thoughts on instagram ads on mobile opening up on Instagram's in-app browser, as opposed to opening up in a standard browser i.e. Chrome?
[3.11.25, 0:53:04] ~ Kyle Twohill: 2 days ago I had some campaigns overspend
[3.11.25, 3:50:29] ~ Wouter: For my brand, my paid media buyer is getting good results, but it seems like he can’t scale. He’s using cost-per-result (CPR) goals, but the campaigns aren’t spending the full budget we set — around $15K per ad set. They’re only spending about $600 a day. What can we do to fix this and scale effectively? The roas is very healthy with around 3+. He is saying we have to wait until facebook thinks it can get $31 (AUD) per per purchase while I think can we adjust it to let’s say $35
[3.11.25, 3:59:19] ~ Omar: Why doesn’t he switch to ABO or cbo
[3.11.25, 3:59:38] ~ Wouter: Because they don’t perform that well
[3.11.25, 3:59:40] ~ Wouter: Roas drops
[3.11.25, 4:00:03] ~ Omar: Prob funnel problem or ad problem
[3.11.25, 4:16:56] ~ Cocow: On cost cap this is not really easy to manage but it the budget is not spent this is because or the cap is too low , or the demands is too low as well 

Putting a cap of 31 with 15k budget , 10k or 1k is probably not going to have any difference in spend cause it seems that Facebook cannot reach that amount of conversion for your goal and your budget so he is limiting himself on the spend   

It is as well a judgment on how much you area ok to scale and decrease your ROAS to get more volume 

Doing ROAS 2 at 2k spend per day is probably better than 600 at 3 ROAS in terms of MONEY
[3.11.25, 5:05:27] ~ Wouter: Send you a pm
[3.11.25, 5:05:33] ~ Wouter: Why?
[3.11.25, 5:19:01] ~ Yuanda: He’s using an inflated cost cap budget strategy

It’s not bad idea to loosen the cap slightly by a little bit to find the sweet spot of 2.5 roas and let’s say now it’s spending 2k per day

The big benefit of this strategy is that when you drop in the new winning ad, can instantly spend more so I wouldn’t be concerned if the budget not fully spending. Focus more on ads
[3.11.25, 5:25:42] ~ Wouter: Yeah that’s what we’ve been doing
[3.11.25, 10:30:36] ~ Mo: guys working wit freelancers video editors , how much u pay per minute ?

‎[3.11.25, 13:23:56] ~ Ashwin: ‎image omitted
[3.11.25, 13:25:03] ~ James Moffat: What about pre sales page!
[3.11.25, 13:25:58] Topi: Brother usually you’d run A/B test +500 orders and 7 days. Its normal with such a small data you will get these crazy results and fluctuations
[3.11.25, 13:26:47] ~ Ashwin: Context - This is a mid-tier priced sneaker brand 150-200$
[3.11.25, 13:26:56] Topi: If you run 20 orders and make conclusions, you will end up at some point turning live something that is actually losing and thats how the death spiral starts
[3.11.25, 13:28:24] ~ Ashwin: But based on the results & simple logic man, i think PDP is best

When the ad itself is product SKU-focused, it makes sense to drive traffic to PDP

When its brand or generic ad best seller page is fine imo
[3.11.25, 13:28:33] ~ Omar: are u selling in india?
[3.11.25, 13:29:36] Topi: Not commenting on the actual results, i have no idea what youre doing but just warning making conclusions based on 24 orders is gonna hurt you sooner or later
[3.11.25, 13:29:37] ~ Ashwin: also have data of other pages where i have 500+ sales

But man if brand sells 1500-2500 shoes per month then it is too much to ask for 500 sales before test ends 😅😅😅
[3.11.25, 13:29:57] ~ Ashwin: valid man, i agree
[3.11.25, 13:30:33] ~ Ashwin: India, UAE, UK, US, SGP, Australia
[3.11.25, 13:30:53] ~ Marlon Martinez: if it’s fashion then collection pages win imo. can run crazy aov offers with those
[3.11.25, 13:32:18] ~ Fabian: I agree, just regular collection no. But if you push for AOV yes
[3.11.25, 13:32:57] ~ Ashwin: yup, but their collection is limited, all priced at almost same range 

We are upselling using socks & 2 pair offers.
[3.11.25, 13:35:24] ~ Marlon Martinez: i would look at how other winning  fashion stores are running collection offers and test those, there are a lot out there
[3.11.25, 13:36:45] ~ Ashwin: Right, the brand is hesitant to do more offers & upselling bcs they want to position themselves as a brand.

So have to convince them a lot. haha

[3.11.25, 18:02:03] ~ Mohit Uppal: Happened to me a couple of months back. This is almost certainly a payment issue. Do you have a prepaid account or are you working on a credit line with Meta? We had this issue when couple of invoices were still stuck in "processing" and till these got cleared Meta had decided to stop spending the budget

[4.11.25, 0:29:09] ~ MR: I had similar issue, after 2 months of running and 170k ad spent it got rejected.

From my experience I couldn’t revive it. Tried to duplicate with a post id, tried to fix the issue within the ad but it was not performing at all.

[4.11.25, 1:33:00] ~ Guy Edan: Thanks for the feedback. Sounds like its time to write it off
[4.11.25, 1:53:51] ~ Cocow: Never use gif , use mp4 , and autoloop them. Make the video fast with 1.5x or even 2x to reduce time and size. Do not use a video with too much quality this is not needed something like 600x500 is enough you can use an app called Shrinkvid in App Store and install on Mac this is amazing on compression without loosing quality
[4.11.25, 1:57:40] ~ Susana: Will try it out, thanks

[4.11.25, 10:36:55] ~ Mo Ecom: Would love to know as well
[4.11.25, 10:54:06] ~ Phil: its a fresh day in our ads manager and our budget is $80 on this campaign and I have just looked and its spent $120 and its been live for 55 minutes. This has never happened to us before and we got no clue whats going on.

The new adset we launched thats sucking up all this spend and way outside of our budget has a post ID ad in it. Not sure if this is stuffing it up but its spending like crazy and only been live for not even 1 hour and way over budget. Anyone know whats happend
[4.11.25, 11:36:01] ~ Daniel: this has been happening lately, it’s a bug, but fb says it’s normal pacing, happened to me yesterday as well
[4.11.25, 11:37:10] ~ Mithiran: Has anyone setup applovin pixel on checkout champ here? It’s not working for us
[4.11.25, 11:40:16] ~ Phil: Are the giving ad credit for this. Now our campaign won’t spend at all anymore today and it’s 2am where we advertising
[4.11.25, 11:40:43] ~ Phil: Has it been happening every day to you. First time I’ve experienced it
[4.11.25, 11:41:18] ~ Daniel: I know, you can try but most likely they won’t, yesterday they spent 1k in 15 minutes on my account, it happened few times in Sept and yesterday again
[4.11.25, 11:41:40] ~ Phil: Damn that’s crazy
[4.11.25, 11:41:57] ~ Phil: They won’t spend outside of budget right? ‎<This message was edited>
[4.11.25, 11:42:39] ~ Sairaj: Happened with us too in the last few days and they did spend over the budget
[4.11.25, 11:43:05] ~ Phil: A lot over or the usual max spend for the day ?
[4.11.25, 11:44:43] ~ Sairaj: We had a budget of around $500 on that ad account and it spent like $650 by 8am
[4.11.25, 11:45:23] ~ Sairaj: We paused the campaigns for the day then
[4.11.25, 11:45:37] ~ Sairaj: But it was only on 1 out of 3 ad accounts for that brand.. the rest were working fine ‎<This message was edited>
[4.11.25, 11:45:54] ~ Phil: Ahh okay, thanks guys for replying
[4.11.25, 11:48:12] ~ Mason: Been happening today to alot of people, us also.

[4.11.25, 12:26:28] ~ Ben Mansour: recently
[4.11.25, 12:29:27] ~ Mohit Uppal: Folks, a question on delivery and ops: especially in US & UK zipcodes. A lot of cases USPS/EVRI delivers packages to the mailbox/ locker/ keeps it with neighbours. In some cases it gets lost/ stolen/ or the customers simply miss it and ask for reshipment/ replacements. What is the general accepted practice in US and UK? Do you reship/ refund free of cost? What's the norm? Is there a particular response which has helped you reduce reshipment?
[4.11.25, 12:29:47] ~ Molka: Same thing happened to us tje other day

[4.11.25, 15:03:18] ~ Joel Cederlund: Anyone have black friday / month swipe file?
[4.11.25, 15:09:46] ~ Daniel: Anyone else struggles with missrep nowadays for new GMCs? I think Google changed their algo the last months
[4.11.25, 16:30:39] ~ Guy Edan: popups on pdp - yes or no? Hearing a lot of opinions on it. Some say it hurts CVR too much but I heard some people say it actually increased CVR cause of the discount they get
[4.11.25, 16:31:43] ~ M: Personally find it to be good if you can get a good 10%+ sign up rate and have good flows
[4.11.25, 16:31:49] ~ Marc F: Yes same here. Just happened again today
[4.11.25, 16:32:11] ~ Jakub: I used popup even with downsell and still got 3.8% cvr
[4.11.25, 16:32:33] ~ M: Plus theres a bunch of data showing it doesnt affect it
[4.11.25, 16:33:59] ~ Monaesh: We tested it and saw a significant reduction in CVR and AOV
[4.11.25, 16:42:49] ~ SA: I have 2 empty GMCs that I need to set up stores on .. all approved and even have some spend on them. But I have no idea what niche to build around it lmao
[4.11.25, 16:51:25] ~ Jesper: You dont need a specific niche
[4.11.25, 16:51:44] ~ Jesper: Just make a general store if you dont know want to go in a niche
[4.11.25, 16:51:49] ~ Jesper: Works perfectly on Google
[4.11.25, 16:51:58] ~ Omar: so how do you go about collecting emails
[4.11.25, 16:53:56] ~ Alamin: For UK, reship at no cost after delaying for some time to see if it magically shows up.

Consumer rights here is that it's sellers responsibility until buyer physically receives it.

If parcel's stolen before it gets to them, it's on us.
[4.11.25, 16:54:13] ~ Alamin: I guess it's also just good practice
[4.11.25, 16:54:33] ~ Alamin: I'd say avoid Evri. Go for Royal Mail if you can.
[4.11.25, 16:59:27] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. 

2 CBO questions:
1. Do u turn off ads that aren’t getting spend after a while? 
2. ⁠Do u separate statics and videos into 2 different CBOs ?
[4.11.25, 17:08:32] ~ Bazeed: Hey guys, anyone has a email flow sop to ask customers for UGC content / TP reviews in exchange for a giftcard/ store credit, something of that sort?
[4.11.25, 17:55:25] ~ Davide: Dmed
[4.11.25, 17:55:35] ~ m: yep first we just ask for feedback with vibes like we wanna help, wanna make sure ur 100% happy iwth us etc etc, they reply with good feedback, then give them TP link to leave review, if they reply with bad feedback, fix it, dnt mention tp.

initial email can be simpler too, like just show happy face and sad face and ask them wt their experience was. if they click sad face, they leave comments so u fix their issue, happy face auto takes them to tp to leave review.

in terms of incentive-we say we will enter u into £50 gift card draw or prize draw.
[4.11.25, 18:02:45] ~ Guy Edan: That sounds great. Whats the % of people that answer the first email?
[4.11.25, 18:06:25] ~ m: honestsly never checked, u reminded me now to check lol
[4.11.25, 18:35:32] ~ POVILAS: You guys use urgency/scarcity? Low stock, i feel like people lose the trust on the web once they see it,
[4.11.25, 18:40:24] ~ MR: I personally make sure its worth turning off, otherwise the performance might slip off.

If you start testing then separate the statics from the videos. Only at scale its good to put together
[4.11.25, 18:41:24] ~ Guy Edan: Thanks 👌🏼
[4.11.25, 19:55:38] ~ Ash: For the guys running supplements right now, what landers are working well? We're about to start testing quiz funnels since Im seeing that everywhere right now. How about everyone else?
[4.11.25, 19:56:14] ~ Adrián: +1 on that, interested 🙏🏻
[4.11.25, 19:58:45] ~ Steve: Long form advertorials and listicles. We're also about to launch a quiz for one of our products but havent tested it for this product previously
[4.11.25, 20:00:04] ~ Ash: and then sending to PDP?
‎[4.11.25, 20:00:25] ~ Sairaj: ‎image omitted
[4.11.25, 20:00:52] ~ SA: Happened to my brothers camp. He turned it off right away lmao
[4.11.25, 20:01:07] ~ SA: Zero Reimbursement lmao
[4.11.25, 20:01:15] ~ Steve: If we have a bunch of avatars were looking to test, well launch a listicle like 9 reasons why. And make sure 5-6 of those 9 reasons hit various avatars 

So maybe the product is good for joints, skin, hair, anti aging etc.

The listicle will have points about all those.

Then we'll run a bunch of ads on those angles specifically into the listicle and see what shakes out with the best performance.

Anything that does really well, I'll turn that angle into a full long form Advertorial dedicated to that angle, and then into a revised PDP that plays to that angle as well
[4.11.25, 20:01:25] ~ Steve: But now well launch the quiz and see how that goes
[4.11.25, 20:01:37] ~ Steve: Yeah PDP post advertorial
[4.11.25, 20:01:52] ~ Sairaj: By the time I realised it was 8am 🥲

[4.11.25, 20:06:53] ~ James Moffat: With 0 sales
[4.11.25, 20:31:30] ~ Veljko Petrovic: I don't really have a swipe file, but I have a good playbook that covers all the dates, teaches you how to create a good offer, and also shows good email examples  from big brands from the previous year. Lmk if you want it :)
[4.11.25, 20:32:00] ~ Mo Ecom: Can you dm me as well?
[4.11.25, 20:32:43] ~ Veljko Petrovic: I wouldn't stress over that too much. Just focus on getting a 10%+ opt in rate and a good welcome flow and all your problems will go away
[4.11.25, 20:43:48] ~ Johir.E: Does anyone know any good courses for native ads
[4.11.25, 20:48:34] ~ Amit Solomon: David Ford (ex-AffPlaybook) had a good course on native.

[5.11.25, 8:22:42] Carlos Leeseman: Only possible if you collect their email or phone of course. So you can do this by a pop up on your site where you ask their email for X discount
[5.11.25, 8:43:24] Austin Li: i heard there are tools like opensend or retention.com that can collect emails without consent
[5.11.25, 8:54:01] ~ Amit Solomon: Post the Andromeda-rollout, how have you guys changed your creative testing process for new batches of creatives? Still using different hooks on a VSL for creative diversity? ABO vs CBO?

just combining all the relevent ads into 1 ad set


and for cost effective testing adding all to 1 ASC and let meta find who is the best
[5.11.25, 16:42:42] ~ Value Adding Personality: ‎This message was deleted.
[5.11.25, 16:50:10] ~ Ashwin: 1. Nope - Let it sit there ( do stress test separately if you are in a hurry )
2. No - Combine all bcs you never know for which funnel stage meta might pick that ad.

I have seen my statistics get less spend but high ROAS ( BOF ad declared by Meta)

Videos with the lowest CPIR and low ROAS but high spends ( TOF ad declared by Meta)

But avg roas from the campaign is great, so let that thing rolling.
[5.11.25, 17:10:37] ~ Alfie: GETHOOKED 

Does anyone know how to have gethookd show currently ran ads of a certain brand. For example we run 50 ads now , it shows only 6.

And it's similar with other brands. Any workarounds or settings to switch?

[5.11.25, 18:09:25] ~ Giovanni: Guys what app do you use for creating return labels? Or you tell the customer the address where to ship the package and it’s up to them how to ship it?
[5.11.25, 18:10:16] ~ Mo Ecom: Do let me know too please
[5.11.25, 19:06:04] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. 
something weird is happening with my add to cart to purchase ratio today and yesterday. It’s suddenly dropped a lot in the last two days, even though nothing has changed on my end.
Until now, about 50% of people who added to cart were buying. Last 2 days it’s closer to 20-25%. 
Any idea what could be causing that?
[5.11.25, 19:11:46] ~ Veljko Petrovic: Might be just the quality of the traffic that's coming to your website
[5.11.25, 19:13:02] ~ 🔋: Anyone got a good checkoutchamp dev they can share? Bonus if they worked in supp/telehealth
[5.11.25, 19:42:55] ~ Matthew Martorano: Hit me up. I had a few for you.
[5.11.25, 19:47:49] ~ Giovanni: What software are you guys using for Customer support? Which is the best one that integrates with Shopify?
[5.11.25, 19:49:23] ~ SA: RichPanel
[5.11.25, 21:39:35] ~ Guy Edan: People using shrine - how do u update the theme but keep the design of the website?
[5.11.25, 21:41:56] ~ Sairaj: Are you selling a seasonal product? 

Or it could just be a minor dip since it’s just been 2 days
[5.11.25, 22:03:07] ~ Giovanni: Guys, how do you organise all the creative strategy?

Do you have something like a spreadsheet where you put all the ideas concept, etc?


I would like to have a place where I have everything for any video for example I have all the hooks all the scripts all the voices overs, all the B rolls so I can give it to my video editor and he already knows how to do the video and everything

[6.11.25, 5:50:32] ~ Carlos: quick question: i have a store on Shopify I need to change the default store currency from EUR to USD in order to use post-purchase upsells and OTOs efficiently. did anyone do this before? are there any risks I should consider?
[6.11.25, 6:45:34] ~ AK: Hey guys, is it okay to test new beauty products in same pixel with my current winners?

For example my current product is hair care product, i want to test some skincare products related to blackheads and whiteheads, can i use same pixel?
[6.11.25, 6:45:55] ~ AK: no risk doesn’t matter what currency you have in shopify just make sure you set product price accordingly

[6.11.25, 8:23:47] ~ AK: hey guys, for subscription do you guys use 30 days? or charge them after few days early like 28 days?
[6.11.25, 9:16:16] ~ Kyle Tseng: anyone notice performance changing when optimizing for conversion vs subscriptions
[6.11.25, 9:16:22] ~ Kyle Tseng: on meta ads for my ecom chads
[6.11.25, 9:19:30] ~ Jakub: Hell nah.
[6.11.25, 9:22:55] ~ -J: Yes this is normal

[6.11.25, 9:56:44] ~ Olly STFD: do you have anymore invite codes? I would be very appreciative if so.
[6.11.25, 9:57:46] ~ Olly STFD: I’m not saying this is the answer but I saw something soimilar last year and it’s down to an economic shift. People are pulling back for the BFCM sales that are coming. Just had to ride it out or launch sale early.
[6.11.25, 10:00:45] ~ Sairaj: E5PY4V here you go G
[6.11.25, 10:05:51] ~ James Moffat: Has anyone found a way to fix ads spending the whole budget in like 2 hours
[6.11.25, 10:09:45] ~ Sebas: We’ve been using this sheet, got it from another community a while back.
It’s quite decent to work with up to a certain point. Here’s the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJEi4wskfJe_U6jNejtQVtZ5p-2m_6DO-20XCNB82Ww/edit?usp=sharing
[6.11.25, 10:14:00] ~ Olly STFD: thanks so much - you are so kind
[6.11.25, 11:11:43] ~ OB: shit’s collapsing
[6.11.25, 11:14:42] ~ Phil: not so much performance just no conversions. ads are doing the best they have been metrics wise just cant seem to convert anything
[6.11.25, 11:15:11] ~ RS: Traffic is much more expensive now but still converting good
[6.11.25, 11:16:40] ~ Mo Ecom: Yeah CTR CPCS amazing all the KPIs work but just no conversions
[6.11.25, 11:16:43] ~ Mo Ecom: What niches?
[6.11.25, 11:17:53] ~ Kyle Tseng: apparel for one
[6.11.25, 11:18:22] ~ Sairaj: Happy to help:)
[6.11.25, 11:19:04] ~ Kyle Tseng: i feel that we need to be careful to not make ourselves feel better by thinking every bodies ad account took a dip it’s a thought that seems complacent
[6.11.25, 11:19:10] ~ Kyle Tseng: i’ve thought it myself of course
[6.11.25, 11:19:22] ~ Kyle Tseng: but i’m just reflecting on my own thoughts
[6.11.25, 11:19:56] ~ Daniel: Hey guys, if anybody was/is doing google and had problems with gmc bans and misreps, message me, I might have a solution for this. Might not be cheap tho, so probably worth if you’ve been doing some volume or want to start over
[6.11.25, 12:42:54] ~ Joel Cederlund: Anyone can recommend supliment supplier
[6.11.25, 13:39:57] ~ Giovanni: For those of you who have the HK company, are you using Shopify payments ? Airwallex told me that I will pay 8% fees with Shopify payments but only 5% with them, is that true?

‎[6.11.25, 13:40:25] ~ Alamin: ‎image omitted
[6.11.25, 13:41:44] ~ Giovanni: It’s always nice to see this so we can blame someone if our ads aren’t doing great
[6.11.25, 13:42:45] ~ 🔋: Count in money lost/gained from approval rates and if you run subs cycle 1, 2 3 etc too. You can save 2% on fees, but if you lose 10-15% monthly to approval rate differences you got much bigger things to look at
[6.11.25, 13:42:58] ~ Alamin: At this point I'm finding it difficult to genuinely decipher if new ad creatives are potential winners or not just based on the stability of the system
[6.11.25, 14:03:17] ~ Ben Mansour: Is it okay to launch a brand with an instagram account that has fake followers? Will it hurt performance? I don‘t want to launch with a 0 follower new account but it reduces trust
[6.11.25, 14:12:21] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: No problem, i did it always for starting ‎<This message was edited>
[6.11.25, 14:27:19] ~ Mo: where do u buy fake followers ?
[6.11.25, 14:28:32] ~ MR: I buy from a guy, i can share here his contacts if in allowed or DM me and i share.

I usually buy likes and comments when i have a performing ad but he does many more
[6.11.25, 14:29:02] ~ Mo: sure bro just dmed
[6.11.25, 14:34:11] ~ Giovanni: Makes sense. So even if my company is in HK and payments are coming from EU, if I use Shopify payments I shouldn’t have problems with cards declined?
[6.11.25, 15:33:50] ~ m: been getting shit loads of PayPal claims thru recently. Mostly UK geo. Anyone else seeing this? idk why.

Little different though. 
Just got a fuck load of random transactions stuck in pending

9:16 or 4:5?
[6.11.25, 20:55:23] ~ Ash: 9:16 with safe zone 4:5
[6.11.25, 20:55:28] ~ Roland: 4:5 in 9:16
[6.11.25, 21:31:47] ~ Giovanni: Guys I’ve had a call with richpanel and I like the platform but it’s very expensive and I’m trying to optimise profits so any subscription counts. 

Is reamaze a good cheaper option?
[6.11.25, 21:36:52] ~ Chris: reamaze works fine for us
[6.11.25, 21:40:26] ~ Giovanni: What about emails coming directly from Shopify when customers submit the form? Don’t they get counted as tickets from “mailer@shopify.com” 

I had this issue before where the customer support platform was seeing all the messages coming from that email and it was counting them as a single ticket 😅🤯

[7.11.25, 3:16:54] ~ Cocow: - first image
- ⁠offer 
- ⁠price 
- ⁠scarcity on pdp and cart 
- ⁠above the fold (usps, value proposition) 
- ⁠a lot of other stuff but if you start CRO these can already give you high high leverage

Then I found out that actually they blocked my payment method as being “flagged” as used to many times across AD accounts. I did use it on another business portfolio. Now I removed it and tried adding new one but Facebook seems to still not spend on Ads that are Labeled as Active. Contated support and they told me that my Portfolio has been flagged and disabled payments. Did anyone had same issue maybe or know the best solution? I am stuck with this problem for 15 days trying new ad accounts in Business Portfolio and New cards etc. Any help is much appreciated 🙏❤️
[8.11.25, 0:13:26] ~ Mai: I had a similar issue for a few days. Somehow, it got fixed after I played around with the payment methods. Not all of the ad accounts were affected though. They said it was just a regular system check, I’m not really sure. But eventually, it got fixed. I kept communicating with them and pushing, and it was resolved

[8.11.25, 3:36:50] ~ AK: Had this issue and still have it

If I use my card on new ad account it doesn’t spend

But if I use my friends/family members card for first $100-200 spend then switch to my card it works 

So solution will be to just use some other people card for first few payments on meta then switch to your card

I don’t think there are any other solutions than this

If Meta is reporting 40% more middle funnel events than what's actually happening, can this throw off performance?

Example.

Meta in platform is showing 1400 add to carts, 700 initiate checkouts and 250 purchases. 

Shopify backend is showing 1000 add to carts, 500 initiate checkouts and 250 purchases.

[10.11.25, 21:22:07] ~ Susana: Monday blues 🙃
[10.11.25, 21:59:43] ~ Fes: Glad you figured it out
[10.11.25, 22:20:37] ~ Joel Cederlund: Yo idk if this allowed but if anyone wanna buy/test out stardust let me hook you up with me affiliate link😅 50% rev lifetime fair and square
[10.11.25, 22:23:19] ~ Alexander: have you used stardust a lot?
[10.11.25, 22:28:31] ~ Joel Cederlund: Yeah, bought it in Beta gets better and better every week. But would still say they have a long way to go. But 6000 usd / 12 month.

1 makeing angle or 1 winning ad it was paid off :)
[10.11.25, 22:30:07] ~ Joel Cederlund: Some times we been using it a lot some times not even 1 time a month.  

But the potential of the tool and what it can become is fire
[10.11.25, 22:33:14] ~ Joel Cederlund: http://meetstardust.ai/?via=joel

If someone else is interested and wanna check it out ^^ (affiliate link)
[10.11.25, 22:35:38] ~ Mai: question for you guys- I’m running a campaign for a new brand (2-3 months) doing 3-4x ROAS with 1 single ad. I did upload many more creatives to this campaign but the ad is so good that FB doesn’t even send that much traffic to other ads.
[10.11.25, 22:36:02] ~ Mai: I do want to test these new and better creatives. so a new campaign just for the testings- that’s the way to go?
[10.11.25, 22:38:49] ~ Mai: 1 main campaign | 1 creatives testing | 1 Retargeting?
It’s for 1 winning product. thanks
[10.11.25, 22:39:50] ~ Joel Cederlund: I might do it wrong but we always test out all ads in abo to force them
[10.11.25, 22:41:05] ~ Mai: so a new Ad set for the new creatives - under the same campaign?
[10.11.25, 22:41:25] ~ Mai: I must say each ad set is a different market. I’m selling this product in multiple countries ‎<This message was edited>
[10.11.25, 22:41:55] ~ Mai: and it’s on ABO
[10.11.25, 22:43:05] ~ Joel Cederlund: I run in a test camp with ABO then move them to scale if they perform good
[10.11.25, 22:43:25] ~ Mai: Got it. thanks. would love to hear more opinions
[10.11.25, 22:43:35] ~ Mai: I’ll try it out
[10.11.25, 22:48:29] ~ -J: Have you found any winning ads from it so far?
[10.11.25, 23:02:25] ~ Joel Cederlund: Yeah for sure. But still tool won’t do it for you, yet atleast.

But Claude and my own experience + stardust really makes a good workflow
[10.11.25, 23:07:40] ~ danny: Someone is spamming my store test ordering like 100 orders every 5 minutes what do I do I think he’s trying to get me shutdown 
What do I do I changed so he couldn’t test order for money in cancelling the orders but they are doing thousands what can I do
[10.11.25, 23:07:46] ~ danny: what do you do in this situation
[10.11.25, 23:08:12] ~ Zsombor: Disable the payment options
[10.11.25, 23:40:13] ~ m: not sure of the best fix but im q sure u can create a max order limit. so u can stop unrealistic quantities from being ordered.

The store and now he buys the cheapest product with Priority shipping😀
[10.11.25, 23:49:44] ~ MR: For me I had someone testing stolen cards
[10.11.25, 23:50:20] ~ MR: and any order he would get though it would show high risk so I had to cancel
[10.11.25, 23:50:29] ~ Chris: We get bots trying to spam buy our free mystery item all the time

[11.11.25, 15:20:17] ~ Ash: We use flat fee and love it
[11.11.25, 15:20:20] ~ Ash: Happy to introduce
[11.11.25, 15:21:00] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. I’ve been doing private label ecom for years but always bought inventory, never dropshipped. Now looking to dropship and have a little noob question - when I look at dropshipping sites like zendrop/mutual dropshipping for example, many of the products are branded in the images. Is that what customers will get, or will they get a white plain botte?
[11.11.25, 15:29:40] ~ Alvaro De Prada: depends on the product but 7/10 you get what you see on the photo
[11.11.25, 15:29:49] ~ Alvaro De Prada: unless is a big known western brand
[11.11.25, 15:32:18] Shayan: At Zendrop, you'll get the generic version if it's a product from China because it's not your brand. We also have US products in the catalog that are branded. The US products will be shipped out with that branding because we have permission to dropship those. You can also request to source any product through the platform and we'll quote at competitive prices but once you actually start generating sales, you'll get moved to the Private Agent program (zendrop.com/private-agent) where there are no subscription fees. We'll get you custom branding, product customizations, custom quotes, CN 3PL and US 3PL.
[11.11.25, 15:35:17] Shayan: We offer US 3PL, service a few people in here. Ohio and Miami warehouse locations. Feel free to reach out if interested.
[11.11.25, 15:37:53] ~ Guy Edan: @⁨~Alvaro De Prada⁩ @⁨Shayan⁩ Understood. Thank you guys.
[11.11.25, 15:46:37] ~ m: *FB profile provider for white listing purposes* - does this exist? anyone got a link where i can buy? thanks

[11.11.25, 17:15:09] ~ John B: I recall some people in here speaking about FB spending budget too quickly on new ads. Some new testing ad sets with a budget of $25 just spent 50 within an hour of being live for me🤣 Did anyone find a reason for this
[11.11.25, 17:15:42] ~ James Moffat: Nah it’s just meta being meta. But over the course of 7 days it won’t spend beyond your budget
[11.11.25, 17:17:36] ~ Susana: I’m on week three of a new ad agency setup. It’s been rough. Every budget bump, meta punishes me for one day. The guys say it’s because it’s in learning phase. Does it get better?
[11.11.25, 17:17:46] ~ John B: True. Never happened till recently, and there’s no pattern of what could be causing it. Just curious
[11.11.25, 17:24:11] ~ Omar Tayara: What ad account structures are u guys using for black friday?
[11.11.25, 18:51:07] ~ Chris: Dig dick swingers, how much will you spend on meta ads testing a new product?
Imagine it's a product you have hiiiigh conviction of.
[11.11.25, 18:51:39] ~ James Moffat: You can tell in the first $200 if it’s worth carrying on
[11.11.25, 18:52:42] ~ Ash: For quiz funnels - whats a good completion rate?
[11.11.25, 18:57:04] ~ Tomer Bachar 🇺🇸/🇮🇱: Also any good examples for good quiz funnels?
[11.11.25, 18:58:52] ~ Chris: Even if the product has very different avatars?
[11.11.25, 19:01:03] ~ A: There are people who look on weekly basis. When I dropshipped fashion I used to kill fast af though (first two days if no sales). But outside of fashion dropshipping I would let it run for longer
[11.11.25, 19:01:05] ~ Mohit Uppal: More than spend I would say test at least 10 certified banger ads. Maybe upto $500 ($250 across 2 landing pages/ prices perhaps depending on what product you have).
[11.11.25, 19:02:08] ~ Chris: Mmmm, thank you!
[11.11.25, 20:34:28] ~ -J: anyone know how to remove sensitive content tag on an ad?, had it added to one of my brands top spenders and performance shit the bed
[11.11.25, 21:43:10] ~ Ben Mansour: When you have a cost cap campaign not spending
[11.11.25, 21:43:29] ~ Ben Mansour: Do you raise cost caps inside current adsets or create new adsets with different cost caps? ‎<This message was edited>
[11.11.25, 21:46:11] ~ Chris: My normal strat is slowly raise it
[11.11.25, 21:46:12] ~ Chris: Nothing
[11.11.25, 21:46:12] ~ Chris: raise it
[11.11.25, 21:46:13] ~ Chris: nothing
[11.11.25, 21:46:15] ~ Chris: blink
[11.11.25, 21:46:25] ~ Chris: HOLYYY FUCK WHERE HAS MY MONEY GONE
[11.11.25, 23:01:04] ~ Matt: What are the red lines to not cross when making ads for meta? Brands like froya and Norse organics break loads of policies (fake doctor whitelisted pages, specifically mentioning medical conditions, drastic transformations etc) and it’s the same in pet market too but seems everyone is doing it… anything to not do to avoid getting banned explicitly?
[11.11.25, 23:23:49] ~ Susana: I have a friend who does that but he has an agency account. He’s printing though, prob able to pay anything 
I don’t agree with this but it is what it is
[11.11.25, 23:45:49] ~ Fes: It is probably payment issue, I was having a lot of troubles and it was cause of my card getting declined. Made new ad account and first added new card I never used on Fb and after starting some engagement warm up campaigns when it started spending I added my normal card. Thats what worked for me
[12.11.25, 1:02:19] ~ Giovanni: Is 2k day too much for a new HK PayPal account?

[12.11.25, 2:47:08] ~ -J: Anything meta tells you do the opposite

[12.11.25, 3:15:25] ~ Chris: Don't get me started on fucking customer support.
[12.11.25, 3:15:53] ~ Chris: Pay any other company 7 figs a year and they would suck your dick daily

[12.11.25, 4:35:38] ~ Mithiran: yo guys is there an alternative to gemini image gen?
[12.11.25, 5:09:30] ~ MR: None of them are perfect in my opinion. I used to generate a lot with GPT but lately I’ve been using Higgsfield, it has a bunch of stuff in it
[12.11.25, 5:11:06] ~ Mithiran: I find that gemini is pretty realistic for editing a real image and changing it to however you want. It just takes like 20 tries to get it right. Is higgsfield good at that?
[12.11.25, 5:12:23] ~ Chris: Anyone used mentor pass?
[12.11.25, 5:13:09] ~ MR: In my experience as long as I get something decent then I go with the image in photoshop and finish all the touches or any changes.

Highfield would require some tried too so yeah it’s not perfect.

But I like it because it has many many things integrated

[12.11.25, 21:18:42] ~ Mai: quick question guys, I'm doing first production for 2 products (wellness) I'm launching. I want to do FBA right away, together with TT shop and fb ads, send to creators and stuff. the products are pretty cheap to produce.... how many pieces would you ship to Amazon on the first batch. 250 or 500 per product sounds reasonable? what’s the lowest you’ll go or Amazon allows you to do?
[12.11.25, 21:29:25] ~ Ronak: 250 is solid
[12.11.25, 21:29:55] ~ Mai: 250 to ship to amazon?
[12.11.25, 21:30:47] ~ Mo Ecom: if the product is cheap and you are launching in Q4! have atleast 500 to 1000 units send to FBA
[12.11.25, 21:30:49] ~ Felix: you can also just send 1 to amz, doesnt matter on amz side
[12.11.25, 21:31:13] ~ Mai: production time is fast, 3-4 days
[12.11.25, 21:31:19] ~ Mai: I see
[12.11.25, 21:31:38] ~ Mo Ecom: Still check in times are shit in Q4
[12.11.25, 21:31:50] ~ Mo Ecom: You need to be in stock to be able to maintain your rankings
[12.11.25, 21:32:22] ~ Mo Ecom: You can also use AWD to save Amazon storage fees

[13.11.25, 0:13:25] ~ Marc F: can we run ads from a fb page using “Dr. Whatever” or we might get in trouble for the Dr.?
[13.11.25, 0:30:50] ~ SA: 7 fig 8 fig 9 fig brands doing this without real Drs
[13.11.25, 0:31:30] ~ SA: I think you’ll be fine
[13.11.25, 0:41:05] ~ A: Here is my review. Don’t do it. Waste of money and time. Bans after bans after bans. 

Party that I went with is called Kuronet, I say their name because they didn’t give me my money back after a lot of headache, restrictions and bans.

Never saw so many bans in my life.

[13.11.25, 7:20:13] ~ Ashwin: Did they change the entire ad account setup in 1 go???

If yes, then noob mistake 

Never change the whole setup as ad account needs time to adapt to new campaings & funnel setups.

Always start with 20% changes, no matter how fast we want to move.
[13.11.25, 7:21:49] ~ Susana: I started with the new ad account, shared the pixel and went with it. Same store, same funnels, same everything
[13.11.25, 7:23:01] ~ Ashwin: IMO, he wants to ask did early BFMC hype building ads from other brands increased the competition early.
[13.11.25, 7:24:56] ~ Ashwin: You should have kept the older setup active, whatever was working and in mean time build an alternate in new account.

Starting new in high CPM time is just choosing the rough route for new campings as much as possible.
[13.11.25, 7:26:19] ~ -J: You never heard of sarcasm?

[13.11.25, 9:19:35] ~ Phil: Instant page builder at the moment
[13.11.25, 9:19:44] ~ Phil: But heard replo is the best so may move to that
[13.11.25, 9:28:43] ~ Monaesh: I think replo should already have templates for this
[13.11.25, 9:29:17] ~ Monaesh: https://www.replo.app/template/listicle-a
[13.11.25, 9:51:42] ~ Mo: Does it have analytics?
[13.11.25, 11:23:22] ~ RS: What logistics company does your shipping agent use to ship skincare products from China to US ?
[13.11.25, 12:07:05] ~ Vaidik Ruparel: any recommendations of a google ads spy tool? specifically for ads placed between youtube shorts
[13.11.25, 12:23:39] ~ Joel Cederlund: Yes, Bank but the bank refreence been undergoing tracking for 1 week
[13.11.25, 12:46:54] ~ Sarunas: Anyone is in Phantom Travel community or using LLC setup for AMEX pts?
[13.11.25, 12:58:37] ~ Davide: YANWEN rn, but looking for change it, gave us bad mistakes about delivery
[13.11.25, 13:01:58] ~ Davide: WAMB express seems better, we used a while ago
[13.11.25, 14:17:21] ~ Mohit Uppal: Folks Amex just disabled their payment method to our store, citing no reason whatsoever . All our docs and verifications are in place as verified by shopify . They said its completely Amex's call and can do nothing about it. Theres literally no one who responded from Amex to us. Our chargeback % is less than 0.05% across all payments including amex. Anyone face this issue and were able to resolve?
[13.11.25, 16:07:57] ~ SA: Has anyone experienced their ad account just not spending any money? Even after running an engagement campaign
[13.11.25, 16:25:24] ~ Christopher Murphy: If it’s new account sometimes it takes a couple days on conversion campaign. Or if you’re running manual bids and have no conversion events it won’t spend
[13.11.25, 16:41:35] ~ SA: I was running an engagement camp for a month at very low spend to warm up the account 

Launched a sales camp, my meta daily budget is limited to $20/day but it’s still not fully spending 😭
[13.11.25, 16:44:40] ~ Omar: just get an agency ad account
[13.11.25, 16:45:14] ~ SA: If you can make personal ad accounts work, they’re usually the best no?

[13.11.25, 16:49:54] ~ Susana: I was able to make 800k rev in 3 months on a personal account. Got an agency account and it’s been very inconsistent now. Launching store in another parallel personal as account to compare agency vs personal
[13.11.25, 16:57:45] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Our biggest accounts are also personal accounts, running with no issues. But can help you get agency account if you need
‎[13.11.25, 16:59:11] ~ Jan: ‎image omitted
[13.11.25, 17:00:03] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Yes seen this, try to stop the ads, add funds to you account and then relaunch the ads. If it doesn’t work first time try again and that usually fixes the issue
[13.11.25, 17:00:22] ~ Guy Edan: To generate images yes. It tells me we need to wait usually 5-30 min
[13.11.25, 17:00:55] ~ Jan: Pro plan isn't supposed to he unlimited? Never seen this and been using it for months ‎<This message was edited>
[13.11.25, 17:04:05] ~ Guy Edan: I also got the pro plan but if u do a ton of images in a short period of time it’ll give u the waiting times

[13.11.25, 17:10:18] ~ Ben Mansour: Keep spending and wait
[13.11.25, 17:10:40] ~ Ben Mansour: But you should expect some sales from day 1-2
[13.11.25, 17:10:41] ~ Ben Mansour: If not

[13.11.25, 18:25:32] ~ Chris: Wellness, but the ads are shit
[13.11.25, 18:32:42] ~ SA: Yeah makes sense for this niche
[13.11.25, 18:33:45] ~ SA: Also guys, for those who have business manager verified by using a US LLC with a Tax ID EIN - do you guys get charged tax on the ads?

Do you reclaim later?
[13.11.25, 18:58:43] ~ Gregorio Morriello: Heyy Guys! Does anyone know how to get back a LinkedIn account?

[13.11.25, 20:12:56] ~ Jan: Hey guys, which AI tool do you think is the best for generating images where you can place several products, such as jewelry or fashion items , together in the same image, like inside a cabinet, while maintaining a photorealistic style and product consistency?
[13.11.25, 20:18:14] ~ Bazeed: I have seen cpms are always very high on new ad accounts, but get to normal in 1-2 weeks on running ads
[13.11.25, 20:27:42] ~ Guy Edan: With AI being so good now, is anyone using grid bank and can say if it’s worth it?
[13.11.25, 20:29:12] ~ Chris: tbh, it's a new ad account and new brand.
Haven't proven pmf yet.
[13.11.25, 20:34:33] ~ Kyle Twohill: I used it but think its a total ripoff

[13.11.25, 20:52:26] ~ Chris: That's fucked
[13.11.25, 20:52:31] ~ Chris: At least you're getting sales
[13.11.25, 20:52:52] ~ Rustam: It is when I dialed things in a little
[13.11.25, 20:53:05] ~ Rustam: Before that I was seeing $600 cpm and no sales😂
[13.11.25, 20:53:09] ~ Chris: wtf
[13.11.25, 20:53:13] ~ Chris: What category?

[13.11.25, 20:53:25] ~ Chris: ahhh
[13.11.25, 20:53:46] ~ SA: Probably top 5 most competitive niches on meta arguably lmao ‎<This message was edited>
[13.11.25, 20:53:47] ~ Rustam: I guess it is this expensive honestly, but conversion rates make up for it
[13.11.25, 20:54:26] ~ Rustam: 100%
[13.11.25, 20:54:28] ~ MR: @⁨~Rustam⁩  for how long u been using the facebook page that u currently running?
[13.11.25, 20:54:29] ~ RS: I still see cpms like that on my scaling campaigns in the same niche😀 but still profitable even with 4$ cpcs
[13.11.25, 20:55:07] ~ MR: I had crazy CPM’s and CPC’s for last 2 months or so, I changed new pixel and facebook page, ran an engagement campaign for 2 weeks and things are way better
[13.11.25, 20:55:09] ~ Rustam: Facebook page was warming up for like 3 months till I was waiting for stock with engagement campaigns, then did a bit of traffic campaigns
[13.11.25, 20:55:36] ~ Roland: Flora AI + Seedream
[13.11.25, 20:56:17] ~ Rustam: Yeah, it’s kinda crazy you can be profitable with these kinds of cpcs😂 but what can you do. My gross margin is 80%, so can pay a lot per purchase. Just want to get as much data as possible right now to scale with what works
[13.11.25, 20:56:36] ~ Rustam: Vsl - advertorial - pdp is something that turned it around for me
[13.11.25, 20:56:46] ~ Jan: you mean like combining them to get good results or both separate are good options?
[13.11.25, 21:14:55] ~ Christopher Murphy: I’m assuming beauty niche? lol
[13.11.25, 21:19:26] ~ Christopher Murphy: Agreed. Pretty expensive and not that many great videos

[14.11.25, 2:15:38] ~ Guy Edan: People using supliful - is the correct way to create quantity bundles is to do it from the “Create bundles” inside supliful website, or should it be done regularly within Shopify only and if someone orders 3 units, supliful will know it’s one order with 3 units? 
Hope the question is clear

They beat the rates I was paying before, shipping times are the fastest I’ve seen, and they’ve helped me scale without headaches.

Been with them close to a year now and barely any issues.
If you want the plug, just DM me and I’ll connect you.

[14.11.25, 17:03:33] ~ Seth: Appears like an admin on our Meta Business Manager might’ve been hacked, leading to their profile and our main ad account getting restricted (without a review button). Tried paying for an unban, but they said they’re unable to unban ad accounts disabled due to being compromised. Anyone have experience recovering a compromised ad account? I believe it should usually be self-service, but we’ve received no emails and have no options to get it reviewed

[14.11.25, 19:40:15] ~ John B: Personally I do different campaigns for each but I only have 3 main products. If you have a lot of skus I think consolidated campaigns is fine just get a good naming convention. But I know nowadays some people have one campaign for testing, scaling, diff products and landing pages all in one - so I think whatever you choose will work fine
[14.11.25, 19:41:44] ~ Lovro Knavs: Each product its own ABO campaign for us, just more clear for me imo

[14.11.25, 23:58:02] ~ Cocow: Always hard on these things to have a clear idea of effectiveness without a real ab test

Cause having some tips may lead you to chose having this enabled but you are not aware of the possible people not checking out because of this. Event if this is not mandatory for the clients , they can be a bit skeptic and asking their self why should I give a top to this company , what are they going to do with this money etc …

 (just my personal perspective , not backed by any data, but I would be careful on these things)
[15.11.25, 0:13:51] ~ SA: So far talking to a few larger operators and even from a customers perspective it’s almost always a deterrent and comes off as greedy
[15.11.25, 1:02:33] ~ Richard Nguyen: Hey guys we are planning on testing some Meta Ads using a new FB page. 

Wanted to ask if anyone has seen any difference in running a test on a fresh new page vs an older page.

The reason we are running on a new page is to make the ad look more organic and not from our brand.
[15.11.25, 1:04:23] ~ Sarunas: Just run it, I run same offer from 10 different pages, no difference at all
[15.11.25, 1:05:54] ~ MR: Whats the reason you run from 10 pages? I have a competitor also running 10 pages lol
[15.11.25, 1:10:06] ~ Sarunas: There is bunch of reasons
[15.11.25, 6:05:15] ~ MR: Could you share 2-3 of them? I have a product is that is at product aware stage/most aware. Would it help running from different pages with Influencers names or Dr?
[15.11.25, 6:06:43] ~ Chris: We use a couple pages. 
1 brand one and the others look like normal people. 

Performs better for some content
[15.11.25, 10:18:33] ~ Ashwin: Hi everyone. We’re seeing lower attribution on Meta even though all events are firing correctly & sales are matching across Shopify & Meta Events Manager. Only the final attribution to Meta is coming in much lower than usual. 

Is anyone else facing this on their accounts? This drop is also affecting campaign learnings a lot. Numbers are down 2x-3x
[15.11.25, 11:24:40] ~ Mohit Uppal: Which market?
[15.11.25, 12:33:45] ~ Gregorio Morriello: Hey guys!

I find it hard to get any ads working, I did scale 1.2mil since february but lately it’s been dog shit and I want to find out what are some important aspects i should focus on.
[16.11.25, 7:25:02] ~ Antonio Celani: Guys, I have a campaign (cbo) that's going very well, I have 50 creatives, high roas, in the last days the roas got a bit down and it says some of the ads are learning limited, do you guys think it's enough to raise the budget to exit the learning limited stage? (I did not up the spend for quite some time because the sales where already high enough for my cashflow to continue shipping products)
[16.11.25, 10:30:58] ~ Olly STFD: I ran without tips for years and then with tips for years after turning it on - it made no effect. Stop being scared to make tests. It’s the only way to learn and results will differ for everyone. You need to test to get the data but from what I have seen, people are so far down the process they won’t not buy because it’s there, they just won’t tip. ‎<This message was edited>

[18.11.25, 16:50:14] ~ Gigi: Everithing
[18.11.25, 16:50:22] ~ Gigi: Lost chargeback I think
[18.11.25, 16:50:41] ~ AK: is it just shown up on the analytics section on shopify when i see chargeback rate?
[18.11.25, 16:50:55] ~ AK: so the chargeback rate I am seeing on shopify is including paypal? or just shopify payments?
[18.11.25, 16:52:59] ~ Gigi: Just it
[18.11.25, 16:53:14] ~ Gigi: You’ve complete analitics
[18.11.25, 16:53:52] ~ AK: so as long as my chargeback rate shown on shopify analytics is below like 0.3% I am good?
[18.11.25, 16:54:05] ~ AK: that mean combined both paypal and shopify it’s 0.3% ya?

[18.11.25, 17:19:00] ~ Sean: if you are running white hat (generally legit business) and can prove it, can try spamming the shopify ceo and support on X
[18.11.25, 17:43:11] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. A customer is saying she didn’t receive her refund (done via Shopify) when it was done 2 weeks ago. Any ideas what I can do in this case?

[18.11.25, 17:46:00] ~ Sean: tell the customer to contact her credit company. if shopify says it was refunded on your end, you're good
[18.11.25, 17:52:53] ~ Sarunas: What guys you using for chageback management? You train your VA or apps like chargeblast?

[19.11.25, 0:50:59] ~ Alexander: we have trouble with someone trying make scam orders the cheapest thing in our shopify store. like 100+ tries from all over world coordinated in the same minute. it always fails because the market is closed to their regions. they probably use vpn, because it says they are doing it from spain with united states addresses with generic names John Doe, Taylor Lara etc. How do you get rid of them?

[19.11.25, 16:14:38] ~ SA: I tested some long form native ad copy and got much lower CPMs but obviously traffic quality is usually worse cause they’re all curious clicks
[19.11.25, 16:15:05] ~ RS: I have over 200$ cpms often for problem aware ads and advetotrial as landing page and 4$+ CPC but still can make it profitable
[19.11.25, 16:15:24] ~ SA: What kind of daily budget should I test for the week
[19.11.25, 16:15:24] ~ RS: Long for ad copies about 1000 words
[19.11.25, 16:15:46] ~ SA: Even with a low AOV product? Like $30-$50 range ?
[19.11.25, 16:16:27] ~ SA: You’d need a killer CVR for that kind of cpc
[19.11.25, 16:16:30] ~ RS: My product costs like 50$ but Aov is 120+.  If you have so low AOV i dont think you can make it profitable in this niche
[19.11.25, 16:17:40] ~ RS: Try to bump up your Aov to at least 100$ with upsells and bundle offers. And better ads. Of course with 8$ CPC you will not make it profitable. But with 3-4$ cpcs easy if your funnel, ads and Aov is good
[19.11.25, 16:20:32] ~ SA: Damn, it’s just a normal hair supp. Going to be tough for sure. I see others in the space with a similar AOV too - maybe I need to ride it through haha
[19.11.25, 16:20:59] ~ Guy Edan: Agree. Had a anti aging brand we consistently had $150-250 cpms and 3-5 cpc. Only way we were able to make it profitable was with $120 aov
[19.11.25, 16:21:30] ~ RS: Maybe subscriptions. I dont think you can make it profitable with just under 50$ Aov in hair niche. They mostly have over 100$+ aov
[19.11.25, 16:21:43] ~ RS: Same for me
[19.11.25, 16:21:47] ~ Guy Edan: Try and buy their products. All big direct response hair care brands have really good backends with ton of upsells

Meta just spent the full daily budget within a blink of an eye, overshot by a large amount, not a single conversion.
Checked the settings, all seems correct.
Was a new product launch.
Metrics also make 0 sense: 7000 impressions and 31 visitors

Anyone ever experienced this?

Not really affecting business outcomes, but does meta give money back on this, i mean that’s just a scam lol ‎<This message was edited>

[20.11.25, 15:23:14] ~ Gigi: Hey guys, how do you react when an ad winner gets rejected? How do you relaunch it? Do you edit it in the same ad set?
[20.11.25, 15:29:28] ~ AK: I usually change primary text and healine on same ad
[20.11.25, 15:32:54] ~ Gigi: In a new ad set?
[20.11.25, 15:40:56] ~ Joel Cederlund: Anyone have stripe eu rep contact?

[20.11.25, 19:43:50] ~ Mithiran: Do you guys recommend ACTUALLY discounting ur product for Black Friday? We did free gifts but the offer isn’t working that well so far
[20.11.25, 19:51:15] ~ Steve: Test
[20.11.25, 19:51:24] ~ Steve: We lowered prices, did BOGO, offered gifts
[20.11.25, 19:51:40] ~ Alamin: Anyone notice that more customers not directed to correct shopify markets site? Seeing US customers beinf directed to our UK site 🥲
[20.11.25, 19:51:47] ~ Steve: Turns out we ate into margin a little too.much so brought prices back up, kept the BOGO and the gift, didn't see a huge drop off
[20.11.25, 19:51:59] ~ Steve: Took a few tweaks etc
[20.11.25, 19:53:54] ~ Sarunas: Check if Meta preselected optimized website destination
[20.11.25, 20:02:18] ~ Alamin: How would that impact redirection you think? Landing on any page should take you to the country-specific version. Depends on IP/location but clearly something wrong
[20.11.25, 21:14:26] ~ -J: @⁨~Léo⁩ can you reinstate meta ad acc?

[21.11.25, 13:34:34] Marek Olszewski: you can use shopify flows for this
[21.11.25, 13:51:09] ~ Vivaan: Does anyone know any way to stop people from taking your ads down? All of it is custom content too lol

[22.11.25, 0:31:47] ~ Henry: Hey guys, does anyone know how you can get a Meta Account Manager? Currently spending $20k a day yet no manager
[22.11.25, 0:33:10] ~ Josh Ozturk: we got same issue spending $20-30k a day but we never got an account manager
[22.11.25, 0:33:22] ~ -J: You mean meta marketing pro?
[22.11.25, 0:35:03] ~ Henry: Maybe, I’m not sure what the difference is
[22.11.25, 0:35:28] ~ -J: Pre sure it’s same thing , trust me bro you don’t need em
[22.11.25, 0:35:34] ~ -J: They don’t know shit

[22.11.25, 0:53:18] ~ Henry: Yeah this isn’t about ads advice. I want to talk to them about account issues
[22.11.25, 0:54:43] ~ Dryden Byrd: that's good
[22.11.25, 1:25:29] ~ Anatoliy Labinskiy: Hi team. Anyone can recommend any good freelancer/agency to run ads on Taboola?
[22.11.25, 2:26:54] ~ Kyle Tseng: consumers are getting smarter thru chat gpt, on one of my ads a 55+ male uploaded a ss into the comments with a chat gpt ss saying that i up charge 5x6 times on my product based on the angle 😹
[22.11.25, 2:39:59] ~ Susana: Question guys, two weeks ago, an ad account I had got DMCA'd because of some b-roll in some ads I was running (it wasn’t even my main product) 

I have a fresh new setup with a new store domain, and I’m trying to launch a campaign for my main product (new pixel) but performance is shit. Can meta flag my products name? Should I change everything?
[22.11.25, 3:02:57] ~ Jeb: Anyone have shopify theme recommendations for older people? 

Big part of my demo is 60+ and I get messages all the time about how hard our website is to use. Especially adding 1 product to cart then going back to add another
[22.11.25, 3:22:52] ~ Susana: Why don’t you use kaching bundle, the “complete the bundle”?
[22.11.25, 4:04:03] ~ SA: Guys, typically how much do you pay creators to make content for you? In Skincare / Jewelry niche? ‎<This message was edited>
[22.11.25, 4:04:51] ~ SA: Or any niche really
[22.11.25, 4:41:09] ~ John B: If it’s a new pixel you can’t expect it to perform as well in the first days, even weeks if you’re at low spend… especially if the other one had a lot of data. Imo it has nothing to do with product name.
[22.11.25, 5:32:01] ~ Susana: Thank you

Our customers are getting their “delivered” confirmation basically on the same day they place the order, and the delivery times are all messed up on Shop App. Just wanted to check if you’re seeing the same problem on your end.

[24.11.25, 8:29:57] China Bigboss: Ocean pay yes Airwallex no for sure
[24.11.25, 8:29:58] ~ Joel Cederlund: im using oceanpayment but on low scale still testing it out… Worked good so far
[24.11.25, 8:30:27] ~ Mikael: Inc Klarna? what kind of terms did you recieve from the start? payout/hold etc
[24.11.25, 8:30:41] ~ Mikael: Klarna reliable with Oceanpayment?
[24.11.25, 8:30:48] China Bigboss: Yes
[24.11.25, 8:31:13] ~ Michael: Possible with us llc without residence ?
[24.11.25, 8:31:28] China Bigboss: Better with HK setup not us
[24.11.25, 8:31:40] ~ Joel Cederlund: Yeah use klarna, payout i don’t really understand goes throw some process litke ”un seattled”, ”seatteld” and then u can withdraw usally a week
[24.11.25, 8:32:05] ~ Michael: Do you use hk of llc ?
[24.11.25, 8:32:12] ~ Joel Cederlund: hk
[24.11.25, 8:32:27] ~ Michael: Thanks
[24.11.25, 8:32:40] China Bigboss: Welcome bro
[24.11.25, 8:33:19] ~ Mo Ecom: Yes very reliable! Been using it since 2 years now with HK
[24.11.25, 8:33:28] ~ Joel Cederlund: Also i think fees alot higher on OC than shopify plus, Pretty hard to use then 70% is on english and 30% chinese
[24.11.25, 8:34:58] ~ Mikael: Oceanpayment or Airwallex? whats your "avarage monthly" Revenue on Klarna?
[24.11.25, 8:35:55] ~ Mikael: If its more reliable its Worth it. We just got shut down with Klarna again without given any reason so far.
[24.11.25, 8:36:15] ~ Mo Ecom: Oceanpayments! Around 200k on average
[24.11.25, 8:36:45] ~ Joel Cederlund: Heard many people haveing this problem, I my self never experinced it
[24.11.25, 8:41:46] ~ Mikael: I think its just a mather of time… also many times you can get it back by talking to the support but it takes 1-2 weeks. some times you cant get it back at all. Either way this destroys the scale alot...
[24.11.25, 9:43:06] ~ Jan: hey, anyone using airwallex payments, is there any option to activate the 1-click upsells? Different apps like aftersell tell us it is not integrated with shopify so it only can show the thank you page offers
[24.11.25, 11:25:29] ~ Ry: there’s no way. its a shopify thing they only support shopify payment and stripe. all the upsell app dont work with 3rd party not just aftersell
[24.11.25, 12:42:51] ~ Jan: got it, thanks man
[24.11.25, 12:44:12] ~ Ashwin: Guys, how to stop meta fetching codes from Shopify??

my indian audiences are seeing BFCM codes, which are exclusive outside India. 🫠
‎[24.11.25, 12:47:49] ~ Mohit Uppal: ‎image omitted
[24.11.25, 12:57:44] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Will push your CPMs up for sure. And you’ll get shittier traffic. Just fix the problem at the root. See what the reviews say and work on those fields. Faster shipping, product quality, setting real expectations for what and when the customer will receive etc. 

+ Sample size of 3 reviews is pretty small
[24.11.25, 12:59:30] ~ Mohit Uppal: Any idea if they send a survey to most folks who purchase? Or is it completely randomized?
[24.11.25, 13:03:26] ~ Alexander: is there aquick way to get a copycat taken down other than dmca through each platform?
[24.11.25, 13:03:58] ~ Damjan Topalovic: all
[24.11.25, 13:06:32] ~ Ben Mansour: There is a copycat takedown agency
[24.11.25, 13:10:29] ~ Alexander: anyone you recommend?
[24.11.25, 14:06:12] ~ Joel Cederlund: Hit me up to 🙂
[24.11.25, 14:13:50] ~ m: but airwallex bank is ok?
[24.11.25, 14:15:20] ~ m: theres a checkbox somewhere, i cant tell u where as the ui changes every 5 mins lol but for sure there is a way, ive seen it

[24.11.25, 15:31:08] ~ Richard Nguyen: https://bustem.com/
[24.11.25, 16:52:26] ~ Gigi: Hi guys, I have PayPal Wallet in Shopify for my store. It's really hellish, and out of 5,500 orders, I have 1% chargebacks and disputes, with 50% of these lost. Do you think I'm at risk of being blocked or not? I don't even have a single card chargeback, they're all PayPal, so I think Shopify is a bit flexible since it's a new thing. Could I get an opinion from people who are more experienced than me? Also, does Shopify count total chargebacks or only lost ones?
[24.11.25, 16:54:17] ~ Gigi: Furthermore, there is still no app like Disputifier that can track and prevent these chargebacks. Many of these relate to upsells: people accept them but then open a chargeback for a product they did not receive.
[24.11.25, 17:10:15] ~ Fabian: Does Desputifier not work with Shopify PayPal Wallet?
[24.11.25, 17:10:57] ~ Gigi: no
[24.11.25, 17:11:29] ~ Gigi: It's truly a nightmare.
[24.11.25, 17:12:07] ~ Gigi: They don't even give you the opportunity to interact with the customer. They just refund
[24.11.25, 17:12:34] ~ Hugo Yanes Molnar: It’s crazy
‎[24.11.25, 17:14:27] ~ Gigi: ‎image omitted
[24.11.25, 17:14:48] ~ Rick: rip per il bro
[24.11.25, 17:15:08] ~ Gigi: Do they take this percentage into account, or the number of chargebacks lost?

create a redirect on shopify from /producturl to /listicle, or go one by one and change the url manually on all ads?

[24.11.25, 23:54:50] ~ SA: Just curious to those running presell pages advertorials/listicles - have you seen them perform well against a 30-40 age demographic group?

Health niche : supplements ‎<This message was edited>
[25.11.25, 0:00:06] ~ Cocow: Mmmmmmmh honestly , I am not 100% sure this is the best approach cause maybe your listicle is doing better at the moment cause you have a special VSL TOF that is doing an amazing job and then the education on your listicle is finishing the work

However , certainly your pdp is outperforming on MOF/BOF with statics for example. Personnaly. I would not switch all my traffic from a pdp to a listicle cause the performance of a listicle could be really specific to a top spender ad taking the account , a specific angle or approach that is doing great at the moment etc …
[25.11.25, 0:00:51] ~ Marc F: yes you are damn right
[25.11.25, 0:01:19] ~ Cocow: Never change ads you are going to break everything
[25.11.25, 0:01:21] ~ Marc F: what would be the best approach then? create new ads to that listicle, run our best performers to that listicle in a separate campaign? Im a bit lost
[25.11.25, 0:05:36] ~ Sean: Yes
[25.11.25, 0:05:49] ~ Sean: Best performers + new ads to the listicle
[25.11.25, 0:06:38] ~ Cocow: Great question 🤣

Break down and identify the best winning ads that are really crushing on the listicle. Relaunch these same ads again on the listicle url so that they start acquire some data and then, you can optimize time by time your listicle and still run your pdp 

Then you have two pages for different purposes. If at the moment the listicle is crushing it and you want to keep the momentum , you can relaunch your test and out 99% traffic on your listicle if you want to continue on these good results. Then once your new launches are doing better on the new url on meta slightly transition your new launches on the listicle for specific ads CONGRUANT to your listicle 

Then you keep your pdp for statics , mof and bof ads and the listicle for more TOF (assuming here your listicle is TOF 😅)
[25.11.25, 0:06:47] ~ Sean: If the page is really better at converting TOF than your pdp, the best performers adset to the listicle should become top spender ‎<This message was edited>
[25.11.25, 0:10:54] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Set the traffic to 99% on the listicle. New ads use listicle URL only. This won’t trigger a redirect on A/B concert since it only triggers on PDP

This way you don’t kill momentum on your current ads.
[25.11.25, 0:12:50] ~ Marc F: okok perfect thank you very very much for your time everyone
[25.11.25, 0:13:45] ~ Marc F: if we decide to do a different campaign and re run the best ads to the listicle, should we worry about our ads competing against itself? or if we are at low scale it doesnt really matter? (3-5k/day spend)
[25.11.25, 0:13:50] ~ Ash: Curious what you guys would do. We have about 30 new video concepts made. 3 hooks for each concept. How would you go about testing these? Right now we've been testing in ABO but also dont want to launch 30 fucking ad sets.

[25.11.25, 0:50:50] ~ Matt: If I’m testing 2 pages like listicle 1 and listicle 2 I usually just copy over content to the failed page so I don’t need to worry about url redirects breaking at a later point. This won’t work for a pdp vs LP test though
[25.11.25, 1:03:52] ~ Lovro Knavs: Would do ABO and schedule all of them through 3-4 days. Just so not all are launched on 1 single day.
[25.11.25, 3:29:30] ~ Dolinsky: How are you getting the tax number on checkout for Chile? Mexico is pulled automatically by Shopify, but the field is missing for Chile
[25.11.25, 3:36:40] ~ Dolinsky: We are using selleasy for our multi market stores, and it supports multi language. The only downside is that you can only set 1 discount percentage per pp funnel that would apply to all the up/downsells and products in that flow. Work around would be to create product duplicates in Shopify with unique pricing solely for that pp flow and not use their discount feature ‎<This message was edited>

[25.11.25, 11:15:25] ~ Mohit Uppal: Setup the metric landing page views to clicks % on meta. See if that metric has fallen. If clicks are the same only reasoning is lpvs have dropped and for some reason the pages might not be loading.

My Static ads are giving me 30% lower CACs than Videos, but I feel most of them are through retargeting. How much do you let Video ads run (especially if they're using up budgets but not delivering your requisite CACs) and what is your typical mix% of creative between static and video right now? ‎<This message was edited>

Then I  changed up the listicle to a bit more broad, and one the angles has weight loss, and now CPMs are 200-300 (previous listicle/ads was 40-50).

On the same note, I’ll be in a training room the entire week next week, and get to skip Friday’s (the 12/05) call as well. 

I look forward to connecting back with ya’ll on 12/12 at 3 pm EST, so we can get your stores dialed in for the holidays and Q1! 

Please don’t hesitate to DM if anything comes up in the meantime.

[29.11.25, 11:14:56] ~ Veljko Petrovic: I mean just run ads as you'd usually do and optimize your pop-up form as much as possible. That's how you grow your list. There aren't any special kinds of ads that you use to grow your list. It just comes down to getting as much high quality traffic as possible and then converting them via pop-up

[30.11.25, 10:08:28] ~ Fes: Hey guys, I recently created new AD account and meta limit daily spent is already reached in 2 hours, do I just wait for another day so meta can automatically increase it cause it says it is not running anymore
[30.11.25, 10:09:15] Carlos Leeseman: You can try to contact support. Something they will increase is manually
[30.11.25, 11:51:03] ~ Anatoliy Labinskiy: I have a plug. They can help to increase daily ad spend limits
[30.11.25, 11:53:34] ~ Nikola: Btw if you lower your payment threshold to $2 or something like so, the more approved payments, the more the spend limit increases. I did it once a couple months ago and it worked quite fast. Took a day or something.
[30.11.25, 11:55:59] ~ Anatoliy Labinskiy: Hey everyone,
quick question to the group. 

Has anyone here successfully cracked VSL scripts or advertorial copy using AI? I mean where AI is delivering for you quite similar results as a killer copywriter. 

I’m specifically interested in:

• What platforms actually worked for you (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, anything else)?
• Did you use any specific prompts or frameworks that gave you consistent results?
• And what were the biggest factors that helped you get a strong, converting VSL or advertorial with AI only?

If anyone is open to sharing a bit of their process or tips, I’d really appreciate it.
Thanks in advance!

[1.12.25, 19:14:03] ~ MR: I was dealing with similar issue. CPM’s and CPC’s crazy high, and I was like maybe it’s the product, maybe I gotta test more ads.

And just after a few months I was like lemme test a new fb page and pixel, guess what… got 2 products on test rn, both do well and probably will scale one of them, both with CPM’s under 70$ and CPC is between 0.80$ to 1.50$
[1.12.25, 19:14:33] ~ Jet 2: When Meta puts your account under the health/wellness category, CPM usually goes crazy because the account gets treated as    sensitive
It’s not your events causing it. What normally helps is removing anything that looks like a health claim, pausing your ads for a bit, then restarting with fresh creatives. After that, request a review inside Account Quality so they can re-check the category. If it was a wrong flag, CPM drops back. If not, you’ll need a cleaner landing page to avoid that tag 
From my own experience
[1.12.25, 19:14:35] ~ MR: If u make new page just run an engagement campaign for a couple of days, just put any image that will trigger people to leave likes and comments, could be a life quote, a cat or something. and 5$ a day is more than enough.
[1.12.25, 19:15:40] ~ Jet 2: Good POV too 👊
[1.12.25, 19:15:42] ~ Dogi: Thank you guys, will work on it 🤝
[1.12.25, 19:15:54] ~ Jet 2: Give us feedback late bro 😎
[1.12.25, 19:16:03] ~ Dogi: Yessir 🫡
[1.12.25, 19:16:30] ~ MR: Running supplements always pain in the ass but also the MRR is sweet 😂
[1.12.25, 19:17:15] ~ Jet 2: Facts 😂 Supplements come with headaches, but the margins make everyone tolerate the chaos.
[1.12.25, 19:18:57] ~ Dogi: Frfr 😂  I wanted to go in even more aggressively with native statics and advertorials, but now I have to find a solution first
[1.12.25, 19:20:15] ~ Jet 2: Fr though 😂 I was ready to scale hard with native angles + advertorials, but this restriction slowed the whole plan. Need to untangle that first before I push again.
‎[1.12.25, 19:54:24] ~ MR: ‎image omitted
[1.12.25, 19:55:53] ~ Jet 2: Yeah, those 0.00 orders are annoying. Easiest fix is a Flow that auto-cancels any order where the total equals 0 and the payment status is unpaid.😅😅
[1.12.25, 19:57:03] ~ MR: I noticed on some ecom websites that if you remove an item from the cart that is tied up to a bundle then it will remove all the items from the cart so no chance to buy for free.
[1.12.25, 19:57:21] ~ MR: they think cyber monday is for free or what ffs
[1.12.25, 20:36:34] ~ Mohit Uppal: Anyone here who has applied for brand rights protection on meta? Any benefits or downsides?
[1.12.25, 20:39:05] ~ Dryden Byrd: when people remove the actual product from the cart on my store it makes the 'free gifts' the actual price
[1.12.25, 20:39:26] ~ Dryden Byrd: a free 19.99 ebook will then actually change to 19.99 in the cart instead of 0
[1.12.25, 20:39:38] ~ Dryden Byrd: when they remove the main product
[1.12.25, 20:40:30] ~ Dryden Byrd: I just use kaching
[1.12.25, 20:51:19] ~ Jet 2: If you apply for Brand Rights Protection the main upside is that Meta helps you spot and remove anyone pretending to be your brand. It’s useful if you’re actually building a legit brand and want to stop copycats or fake pages.

The downside is you need a real trademark and even then some people say Meta approves them but never gives access to the dashboard. And Meta doesn’t always act fast on reports. So it’s good if your brand is serious, but kind of unnecessary if you’re just selling generic products.
[1.12.25, 21:40:37] ~ R: anyone ever had a case of a competitor having similar AI images and trying to DMCA?

best way to get rid of this?
[1.12.25, 22:03:45] ~ Bryan T: do they accept trademarks in progress or does it have to be already published
[1.12.25, 22:07:02] ~ Jet 2: Use a paid version
[1.12.25, 22:09:13] ~ Jet 2: They don’t accept trademarks that are still pending. Meta wants it fully registered before you can get approved. ‎<This message was edited>
[1.12.25, 22:09:50] ~ Bryan T: makes sense thanks
[1.12.25, 22:38:20] ~ Antonio Celani: hello guys do you have anyone to remove negative fake review in trustpilot ?
[1.12.25, 22:39:03] ~ Jet 2: It’s easy to remove by yourself
[1.12.25, 22:39:20] ~ Jet 2: Had so many of em 
In this current store I built
[1.12.25, 22:39:28] ~ Jet 2: And I removed them all
[1.12.25, 23:08:11] ~ Joel Cederlund: How? 😅
[1.12.25, 23:09:02] ~ Jet 2: Can’t be explained through text lol
[1.12.25, 23:13:45] ~ -J: What are some mids with best approvals? , need some backups to stripe /ocean payments
[1.12.25, 23:15:58] ~ Jet 2: Bro, for Stripe/Ocean backups 
PaymentCloud, EMB, HighRiskPay, Durango  dropshipping friendly 
Checkout/Braintree if you wanna stay low-risk. ‎<This message was edited>

[1.12.25, 23:28:06] ~ -J: What makes you think I’m in HK?
[1.12.25, 23:28:40] ~ Gigi: 95% that have ocean payments have hk
[2.12.25, 1:36:08] ~ Roland: Hi everyone,
has anyone dealt with Amazon Pay setup issues in the US? 
We initially had a German entity registered, which Amazon didn’t accept, leading to the deactivation of Amazon Pay / the Prime button.
We then submitted all required documents to register our US LLC, but the verification was rejected several times (for 8 weeks now).
Today we were finally able to update the new address, giving us hope it moves forward soon…
If anyone knows someone who can help, or what usually happens next/ common pitfalls, any insights would be appreciated.
[2.12.25, 5:40:05] ~ Mo: guys how do u deal with Claude not keeping memory of previous conversations, i have to start all over again from scratch every time  ( im on the Max plan btw so dont think its a plan issue ) ,  I dont have this issue with GPT.
[2.12.25, 5:41:39] ~ Nicolas Business: Start a project
[2.12.25, 5:41:48] ~ Jet 2: We’ve run into this a few times. Once Amazon finally accepts the new US address, the next step is usually a fresh round of verification on the LLC docs  with bank info. The most common delays come from mismatched addresses on the EIN letter, bank statement, or utility bill.
If everything matches 1:1, the review normally pushes through within a few days. If not, they’ll reject it again without saying much.
If you can share what part keeps getting flagged, I can point you to the exact fix
[2.12.25, 5:42:15] ~ Nicolas Business: Inside the project tell it to make whatever chat into an artifact
[2.12.25, 5:42:36] ~ Nicolas Business: Should remember things more often
[2.12.25, 5:43:42] ~ Jet 2: Is Claude better than gpt ?
[2.12.25, 5:45:01] ~ MR: Claude seems to be better at doing some market research and copywriting, and GPT just to put things together. But thats my experience
[2.12.25, 5:45:27] ~ Jet 2: Thanks for the heads up
[2.12.25, 5:45:34] ~ Mo: will try it out thanks bro
[2.12.25, 5:45:45] ~ Mo: i confirm thats what i noitced too
[2.12.25, 5:46:25] ~ MR: But I can see gemini doing great on market research too, I just used it today on a new product test and seems to give way more data that GPT. Like gemini diggs more to find info than GPT
[2.12.25, 5:47:03] ~ Jet 2: Yes i use Gemini a lot as well  it’s very very good
[2.12.25, 5:47:20] ~ Jet 2: What niche are you looking into tho
[2.12.25, 5:47:39] ~ MR: Mainly supplements
[2.12.25, 5:47:57] ~ Jet 2: Oh alright 
I run it too
[2.12.25, 5:48:49] ~ MR: The amount of shit I read daily when I make scripts for my editor or do market research for new product tests, I think I will become a doctor soon
[2.12.25, 5:49:05] ~ Jet 2: Hahaha 😆
[2.12.25, 5:49:36] ~ MR: Or worse I might start to reply like an AI to people, I think I spend more time with AI tools than my girlfriend
[2.12.25, 5:50:03] ~ Jet 2: Damn. Man. 🤣🤣🤣
[2.12.25, 5:50:40] ~ MR: 😅
[2.12.25, 6:14:16] ~ SA: Is that even allowed? That’s technically not infringement

[4.12.25, 3:06:14] ~ SA: If you’re running a proper brand this isn’t the move lol
Only relevant if you’re running shady stuff
[4.12.25, 4:38:05] ~ -J: For dropshipping price and MOQ private label price should be different right?
[4.12.25, 6:28:35] ~ MR: Hey guys, for those who got one product page and are in the supplement niche, what’s your AOV roughly? 

And also I’d like to know if any of you scale to break even during the testing phase
[4.12.25, 8:18:48] ~ Mo Ecom: Yes absolutely
[4.12.25, 8:19:43] ~ Mo: anyone knows who’s the best ecom guru in France who has a program ( like a real one, no fakies) , looking for connections, network etc… especially in the french market

[4.12.25, 8:48:59] ~ Wouter: It’s actually unbelievable
[4.12.25, 8:49:00] ~ Wouter: It’s mostly newbies.
[4.12.25, 8:57:23] ~ Olly STFD: no but I have heard of brands running ads at very low budget to trick competitors so it looks like longest running ad is their winner when in fact its a dud
[4.12.25, 11:07:08] ~ Yente: Yes
[4.12.25, 11:07:49] ~ Yente: You can put something different in the "display link" section
[4.12.25, 11:08:05] ~ Yente: Then they can't find your ads using your URL / brand name
[4.12.25, 13:06:53] ~ Samuele: Guys, which tool do you use to assign tasks to the video editors on your team?
[4.12.25, 13:09:42] ~ Davide: Asana or Click up
[4.12.25, 13:14:14] ~ Brandon: We use asana

[4.12.25, 14:13:24] ~ Marc F: what tool do you all use to launch meta ads in the most efficient possible way
[4.12.25, 14:21:33] ~ Bojan: Hi guys! I just started a supplement brand, coming from a completely different niche, and right away I’m noticing that my metrics are pretty expensive (CPC 9$, CPM 140$ etc..) I know that’s somewhat normal in this niche, especially when the algo has zero data on me. 

My question is- should I kill the ads and test new angles/concepts immediately, or should I wait and let the data settle a bit?
[4.12.25, 14:38:12] ~ Fes: Hey guys, I got early fraud warnings on some payments. I refunded immediately all of them and next I get is refund was denied by Stripe and all of them disputet. Somebody is on purpose trying with different cards and other stuff to close our payment processing. How do you deal with this kind of problems? This is really frustrating and unethical
[4.12.25, 14:54:25] ~ m: Oh shit
[4.12.25, 14:56:43] ~ A: Will sales shield not work for your friend? Block the ip’s of countries you do not sell to so they can not go on your site
[4.12.25, 15:16:09] ~ Lana: China is already blocked but somehow they still get in
[4.12.25, 15:17:47] ~ Christopher Murphy: Yea Kill, impossible to make it work on $9 CPC
[4.12.25, 15:20:46] ~ Jan: Hey, does anyone have contacts for good video editors who are looking for a full-time job?
[4.12.25, 16:57:18] ~ SA: If it’s Day 1 you might wanna ride it out for 2-3 days but if the metrics are really bad then probably not worth it trying new creatives all together ‎<This message was edited>
[4.12.25, 17:03:48] ~ Richard Nguyen: Had this happened too and we got our cpc and CPM down after using an older page and ad account
[4.12.25, 17:14:23] ~ Omar: whos got a latest winning vsl structure swipe file
[4.12.25, 17:16:55] ~ SA: Realized I worded this wrong, if metrics are bad then it’s worth at least trying a new set of creatives & then moving on*
[4.12.25, 17:21:45] ~ Brandon: Has anyone dealt with Amazon DE copyright infringement submissions recently?
I’m trying to file a copyright infringement claim because some sellers are ripping off our Brand name, but the form won’t submit no matter what I try.

Does anyone have a direct email or contact for Amazon DE where an actual human can step in? Any guidance would be huge.
[4.12.25, 17:35:03] ~ m: speak to live chat. im q sure theres an email address like copyright@amazon.com or whatever

[5.12.25, 1:26:32] ~ John B: Guys, we do around 5k a day in spend, one store, 3 main products, top product does 60% of the spend, then around 30% for second, 10% for third, all USA. I want to quickly test my best ads for these products in AU + CA. I was thinking about just making a CBO, 3 adsets, one for each product, all 3 with both AU and CA, and letting it run for a bit, see what does best and then double down on that product and country. Any advice for quickly testing international when you have numerous products like this?
[5.12.25, 1:47:23] ~ Ben Mansour: Better to make a seperate campaign for each product I guess
[5.12.25, 1:47:33] ~ Ben Mansour: Try uk also
[5.12.25, 2:30:13] ~ Mo: Anyone still doubling down on small variations after finding a winning hook + body, still work on my end, what u guys seeing ? ( post meta algo shift …) ‎<This message was edited>
[5.12.25, 3:40:25] ~ MR: 1 CBO per product, and just add both markets AU + CA per CBO

If you want to expand even more, you can try the UK; it’s a very good market. A similar market to UK is Ireland which also has good buying intention.

[5.12.25, 7:14:32] ~ Mohit Uppal: Ballers I need to set different min purchase thresholds by markets for the same coupon code. E.g. For BIG20: I need min purchase threshold as $100 in US and £75 in UK. Which is the best discount app for this? Or is there any other way within shopify to do it?
[5.12.25, 8:25:00] ~ Jan: Hey anyone has the contact of an insider for paypal unbans?

[5.12.25, 9:48:04] ~ AK: hey guys when running spanish ads in US, do you guys select any interest like spanish language or just do broad without any targeting?
[5.12.25, 10:14:18] ~ Ben Mansour: You select spanish language
[5.12.25, 10:14:26] ~ Ben Mansour: But even if you leave iz broad
[5.12.25, 10:14:47] ~ Ben Mansour: Facebook will target people who speak spanish
[5.12.25, 10:47:36] ~ Nicolò: Hello everyone, does anyone have a Facebook insider I can contact? Last night, both of my company's business managers disappeared. I had 5/6 profiles within my company, and they have all disappeared, but the ads are still active. I need to recover them urgently as I had everything on those business managers.

[5.12.25, 15:18:08] ~ Nicolò: yes
[5.12.25, 15:18:37] ~ Nicolò: One of my employees was probably hacked last night and kicked all of us company members out of Business Manager, of which there were two. The ads are still running; I can see them active in Ad Library, but I can't recover access to Business Manager.
The problem is that I have been living off this structure for two years and have had a brand in America for two years. Without all this, I cannot keep my company alive and pay my employees.
[5.12.25, 15:19:35] ~ Solomon Ezra Soleymani: Ah damn as far as I know there isn’t anything you can do but try figuring out who exactly has it and negotiating with em and spam meta

[5.12.25, 21:04:10] ~ Marc F: our scaling campaign all of a sudden is bringing in lots of bots on store (around 30% of all the traffic from that campaign are bots). would you turn that off even if its the scalmng campaign, or let it run as long as its profitable?
[5.12.25, 21:04:18] ~ Marc F: and anyway to prevent that from happening?
[5.12.25, 21:15:19] ~ Brian: I believe NegateBot Or CloudFlare would be able to prevent the bots from coming in
[5.12.25, 21:15:46] ~ Brian: Just becareful that they don't block your LLM bots as well because you lose that traffic
[5.12.25, 21:16:10] ~ Brian: NegateBot = Shopify App
CloudFlare they have bot detection of sorts.

[6.12.25, 15:29:41] ~ Nico Neumann: Think you can upload max 10docs or someting, or specific file size. You can put the docs into one big pdf and then compress it so it doesn’t exceed max file size.
[6.12.25, 17:34:26] ~ Omar: whats the best image to video tool?
[6.12.25, 17:49:43] ~ Joel Cederlund: Yo anyone have good customer support agency?
[6.12.25, 17:50:09] Topi: Yes
[6.12.25, 19:26:18] ~ Fes: Try Sora 2
[6.12.25, 19:26:29] ~ Fes: You can add image as reference
[6.12.25, 20:16:52] ~ SA: Has anyone recovered any ad spend from Google before? It spent my 3x my entire budget in 1 hour 😭😭😭
[6.12.25, 20:33:05] ~ M.Y: I heard about getting credit in very rare cases, 

but they’ll always argue that your budget is meant for a 30 day budget and that they were justified in spending it
[6.12.25, 20:51:57] ~ A: Wtf how?

[7.12.25, 7:29:36] ~ danny: need more of a long form advertorial for cold traffic
[7.12.25, 7:43:44] ~ Brian: This works for cold traffic if you are running founder ads. We run it. Unless you're looking for those advertorials that say: I'm a Doctor of XYZ for XYZ years and ... then you can reference Nooro.
[7.12.25, 7:44:00] ~ Brian: Another one you can check out is this: https://health.nativepath.com/5-collagen-warnings-everyone-over-50-1359-fb-v30. Also founder based but introduced at the end

[7.12.25, 10:25:14] ~ AK: Hey guys, for image ads you guys use 9:16 ration or 1:1?
[7.12.25, 10:26:26] ~ Brian: Use 1:1 so it fits all placements. If you want ads for 9:16, then use existing post, select story placements and put your 9:16s in.
[7.12.25, 10:38:04] ~ Mithiran: 4:5
[7.12.25, 10:49:54] ~ Filippo: looking for a video editor
[7.12.25, 13:52:51] ~ Giovanni: Guys, Amex limited my spend at 17k ( I don’t know why) , what other credit card you would recommend ? I would like something with either cashback or membership points.

I have a company in HK but I’m living in Italy right now and my Amex is a personal Italian platinum. I’m going to call them tomorrow but I don’t think I can remove the limit at the moment
[7.12.25, 13:54:34] ~ Filippo: Maybe US Amex only way…
[7.12.25, 14:01:00] ~ Giovanni: How can I get it?
[7.12.25, 14:18:26] ~ Filippo: the way I know requires you coming to the US
[7.12.25, 14:39:37] ~ Alvaro De Prada: You need to get ITIN + US residential address + Business chase bank account

Wait 2-3 months

Call Global Amex and ask to transfer your history to USA Amex
[7.12.25, 14:40:07] ~ Giovanni: Is it worth it though?
[7.12.25, 14:40:18] ~ Alvaro De Prada: 5000000000%
[7.12.25, 14:40:58] ~ Alvaro De Prada: is a pain in the ass the entire process but Chase gives 3x unlimited points on adspend
Amex gold 4x points up to 150k in adspend per card
[7.12.25, 14:41:23] ~ Alvaro De Prada: If you want fast cashback. I think Slash gives 2.3% and you only need LLC and EIN
[7.12.25, 14:41:52] ~ Giovanni: Got you thanks, I’ll try to see what’s the best in my situation
[7.12.25, 14:52:22] ~ Mo: Guys did this ever happen to u.
Im using a bundle app, one guy from CS unpublished the bundle without telling me. 
Hundred of visitors were sent to a page with no ATC.
Lost around $900 of wasted adspend.
Did this ever happen to u ? 
Should the app refund that money, or just move on. ‎<This message was edited>
[7.12.25, 14:58:57] ~ James Moffat: Why would the app refund that money 😂
[7.12.25, 15:02:51] ~ Mo: Because its their mistake
[7.12.25, 20:30:12] ~ Nikola: Hi guys, any of you use wetracked? Would you say it actually has a positive impact?
[7.12.25, 20:38:23] ~ MR: I use it and i like it
[7.12.25, 20:38:48] ~ MR: Been using since February this year
[7.12.25, 21:05:42] ~ Matt: Remember though this will only apply if you are billed by meta US btw if you are billed by meta Ireland it won’t apply
[7.12.25, 21:08:01] ~ SA: So that means, your need a Meta BM that’s been verified by using a USA LLC correct?
[7.12.25, 21:08:54] ~ SA: Also I came across this AI UGC Podcast

[8.12.25, 7:44:54] ~ Gideon: Which tool for the video and subs would you use to combine with elevenlabs

[8.12.25, 11:55:42] ~ Sarunas: Are you inside? You running their ecom setup? Do you recommend it?
[8.12.25, 11:56:29] ~ Steve: i find it to be an immensely valuable group. was down in Marbella spending time with founder and others, several guys in there live there and we’re moving out there too
[8.12.25, 11:56:56] ~ Steve: different people have different needs and arrangements for corporations, banks and cards. So far really great

Also are you using the same website domain every time u create new ad account?

What about the fb page?
[8.12.25, 12:12:51] ~ Hugo Yanes Molnar: Clothing , and each time we change the FB page and the URL , that’s happened to us like 3 times
[8.12.25, 12:14:12] ~ MR: What’s the reason u change fb page and url link often? And on the same ad account yea?
[8.12.25, 12:14:45] ~ MR: And do you do fb engagement campaigns for each new fb page?
[8.12.25, 12:15:04] ~ Hugo Yanes Molnar: Yes

[8.12.25, 12:26:12] ~ Jan: the amount hold you mean?
[8.12.25, 12:26:21] ~ MR: Yes, bc it’s the minimum they start to work with

[8.12.25, 12:59:15] ~ MN: What affiliate platform/app you folks recommend for Shopify? We want to setup a few of our Influencers.
[8.12.25, 13:08:02] ~ Lukas: Shopify itself has an app called Shopify Collabs
[8.12.25, 13:08:16] ~ Lukas: I’ve heard others using Uppromote
[8.12.25, 13:12:00] ~ MN: Oh sweet - thanks 🙏

[8.12.25, 13:28:05] ~ Nicolò: I need to destroy a competitor who has been banning my ads and accounts for a month, and recently hacked me and deleted everything. I've lost two years of brand history. Today I relaunched on a new BM, and I don't know how he managed to get into my account here too. I have to get revenge at all costs. I'm exhausted by the situation. Who can help me?
[8.12.25, 13:39:35] ~ Filippo: call Dana White
[8.12.25, 14:00:23] ~ Jonas M. Arnold: Just outscale him G
Negative energy is no solution
[8.12.25, 14:24:37] ~ Nicolò: Bro, I was already spending 5/6k a day, this last time he was spending 500 a day, it sucks.

[8.12.25, 14:57:31] ~ Eugen: Hi! I’m looking for a reliable supplier in the gaming or tech niche, anything related to gaming or tech products. Do you know anyone you can recommend?
[8.12.25, 15:28:59] ~ Giovanni: Guys, if you had to start from scratch, which niche would you pick?
[8.12.25, 15:32:08] ~ MR: Supplements with MRR on
[8.12.25, 15:33:11] ~ Giovanni: Would you expect to be unprofitable for how many month at the beginning?
[8.12.25, 15:45:58] ~ MR: To be honest, all comes down to the ads.

I scaled a supplement to 700k in just 3 months, just because the 1 creative was a killer
[8.12.25, 15:48:40] ~ Giovanni: US?
[8.12.25, 15:49:00] ~ MR: UK 70% and EU 30%
[8.12.25, 15:49:05] ~ Giovanni: Can I dm you?
[8.12.25, 15:49:09] ~ MR: Sure
[8.12.25, 15:50:31] ~ MR: But for anyone else running supplements, I notice a big mistake: that many are running low prices just to get the conversions. And this is a mistake… You only attract cheap-quality customers, low AOV and unscalable.
[8.12.25, 15:59:45] ~ Gigi: You run with checkout champ or funnelish ?
[8.12.25, 16:03:14] ~ MR: I run the most basic, shrine theme and a simple product page.
All the sauce stays in the ads
[8.12.25, 16:03:36] ~ MR: And CVR 5+ always
[8.12.25, 16:03:47] ~ MR: AOV 50+ RPV 3/4$
[8.12.25, 16:03:48] ~ Filippo: Don’t need funnels if u want mrr, high AOV defeats the purpose of high LTV
[8.12.25, 16:05:03] ~ MR: Idk, for me I have improved the product quality and people are buying over and over again, or who is on subscription they choose to stay.
[8.12.25, 16:06:24] ~ Filippo: Just saying that people wanting to use funnels on mrr just doesn’t make sense imo, you’re gonna sell a total of 6+ months worth of supply and expect people to come back? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.12.25, 16:12:04] ~ Gigi: Vsl 3/4/5mins +?
[8.12.25, 16:13:00] ~ MR: Most of my customers order 1-2 months worth of supply, and during this period of time they start to notice the results or already see good results, so they come back to buy more. I’m happy for them to come even after 6 months if that’s the case.
[8.12.25, 16:13:21] ~ MR: Actually that performed the worst for me. 40sec-60 sec worked the best. The top winner was 15 seconds long
[8.12.25, 16:13:24] ~ Filippo: That’s what I’m saying what ure doing is right
[8.12.25, 16:14:07] ~ MR: Even to this day I’m shocked that I improved the product formula with chat gpt 🤣
[8.12.25, 16:15:08] ~ Sean: of course tho. money is always better if you get it upfront.. also, if someone used 6 months of supply of your product, the emotional connection is huge, and he's very likely to buy again after it runs out
[8.12.25, 16:19:49] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Completely agree on this + there is so many complementary upsell opportunities you can run during these 6 months.
[8.12.25, 16:19:52] ~ Giovanni: Did anyone sell their brand on Flippa?
[8.12.25, 17:10:46] ~ Ben Mansour: not really, profit wise ltv always beats aov, because acquiring a customer for 90$ for 180$ purchase is less profitable than acquiring a customer lets say with 40$ for 30$ monthly, which is 180 in 6 months
[8.12.25, 17:11:50] ~ Omar: Profitable on first sale ?
[8.12.25, 17:12:53] ~ MR: Took me 2 weeks of testing the product and tested 20 ads before it started to cook, then changed up the offer and it just went crazy. First winner ad spent 180k$ in less than 2 months and 2.5 roas overal.
[8.12.25, 17:13:11] ~ Omar: Hats off to you bro nice one
[8.12.25, 17:14:23] ~ MR: Thanks
[8.12.25, 17:15:34] ~ SA: I emailed my rep & they said they’ll look into it (I’m not sure what kind of power they have lmao) if it doesn’t work out I’ll come connect with you then !
[8.12.25, 17:17:52] ~ SA: If you’re serious get lawyers involved. If serious enough, you could get Shopify & Meta to perma ban them.
[8.12.25, 17:18:26] ~ -J: Anyone have US signer connects?
[8.12.25, 17:20:08] ~ Nicolò: Is it possible?
[8.12.25, 17:23:05] ~ SA: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ only one way to find out. You’d need to essentially a build a base against them with evidence etc… it’s best to talk to a lawyer lol
[8.12.25, 17:25:07] ~ SA: What about VAT tax 😅👀 or you using the HK method or minimize that ‎<This message was edited>
[8.12.25, 17:26:33] ~ Omar: Sounds like HMRC
[8.12.25, 17:27:01] ~ MR: I didn’t pay a single dime
[8.12.25, 17:29:02] ~ MR: I have to ask my business partner what’s up with this VAT since he handles legals and cash flow and also deals with the accountant. We only paid GST tax in Canada, since our company is based there.

But so far I’m pretty sure we did not. 😂
[8.12.25, 17:29:23] ~ MR: The only thing I regret I had 500 orders detained in Ireland, that fuckin hit hard
[8.12.25, 18:20:05] ~ James Moffat: For not paying VAT?
[8.12.25, 18:21:05] ~ Bryan T: What do you guys pay for CRO? Or do most people here handle it themselves
[8.12.25, 18:27:26] ~ James Moffat: Wouldn’t say it’s worth it unless you’re doing 7 figures a month, at which point just go to Carl Weische
[8.12.25, 19:04:42] ~ Alexander: For Shopify in USA, what is the most important thing to have in checkout?
[8.12.25, 19:05:47] ~ Alexander: We are getting some some Atc and ic, but no sales so far
[8.12.25, 19:30:32] ~ David: ads mate
[8.12.25, 19:30:54] ~ David: u need better ads, not a better checkout

[8.12.25, 19:35:33] ~ MR: @⁨~Alexander⁩ This is for u
[8.12.25, 19:36:24] ~ Alexander: 6% Atc 3% ic 0 sales
[8.12.25, 19:36:41] ~ Alexander: 150 usd items
[8.12.25, 19:36:54] ~ MR: Whats the hook rate and hold rate ? and check where the most people drop off in the ad
[8.12.25, 19:37:53] ~ Alexander: Hook rate 32% hold rate 19%
[8.12.25, 19:38:03] ~ Alexander: Then we have a few images also
[8.12.25, 19:38:57] ~ Alexander: Then we have 4 other creatives with 40-50% hook rate and hold rate of 8%
[8.12.25, 19:39:31] ~ Alexander: This is a short video in other words
[8.12.25, 19:41:33] ~ Alexander: But I figured we are doing something wrong in checkout
[8.12.25, 19:45:53] ~ MR: 6% atc is weak, I usually have 13%+
[8.12.25, 19:49:24] ~ MR: Any winners I have short (up to 15 sec.) or long (up to a minute and a half) both on average have 40-50% hook rate and 30-40% hold rate 

But also I need to understand more about your product: what’s the situation with it? How long have you been running it? What did you previously test? etc… So I can give you better advice.

Drop me a DM, we better not spam here. I’ll get hated soon for all the notifications people are getting. 😭
[8.12.25, 20:02:05] ~ Daniel: hey guys, anyone has a contact to take down reddit posts?
[8.12.25, 20:19:20] ~ MR: Hey, I’ll DM u
[8.12.25, 20:48:30] Fabian: Better to turn them into positives, so they enforce your brand.

If you delete, next month a new one just pops up
[8.12.25, 21:06:01] ~ Sarunas: Yo, right now we using gmail, there is alot of emails coming in but my VA is struggling to keep everything organized. Emails get lost, its hard to track which ones were replied to, there is always emails that set on READ but not answered.
What platform or tool do you use for customer support?
[8.12.25, 21:06:48] ~ -J: Gorgias
[8.12.25, 21:12:50] ~ SA: Rich Panel is what we use. Has AI responses and templates you can use and links directly to SP to pull order history.
[8.12.25, 21:14:54] ~ Sarunas: thanks!!
[8.12.25, 21:42:28] ~ Brandon: For one of our brands, we’re looking for a truly custom tracking solution for orders shipped from China. 

Ideally something where we can use our own tracking link and fully control the status messages (e.g not showing that it’s coming from China until it hits the destination country). We ve tried tools like Track17, but they mostly just hide keywords instead of letting us rewrite the whole tracking flow.

Does anyone know a service or setup that lets us build a custom-coded tracking page with fully customizable shipping updates?
[8.12.25, 21:44:53] ~ Solomon Ezra Soleymani: dming you ]
[8.12.25, 21:45:15] ~ Mai: I actually need something like this as well, great idea
[8.12.25, 21:46:01] ~ Cocow: Using tracking more for a few years and amazing experience and good price 

Not fully custom but they idea china cities , and you can as well override manually specific sentences and replace. 

Plus , with one plan you can integrate on a few shops

[9.12.25, 2:29:23] ~ SA: Get the BM verified
[9.12.25, 2:29:27] ~ Richard Nguyen: It’s based on your spend. If you spend more you can get it lifted naturally. If not use an agency account

All other metrics in terms of cpm, conversion rate are same.. 

Have you’ll dealt with anything similar? And what did yall do to finally make it work?

Clients that I’ve been working with have been getting very good CPMs lately and are loving results.

Competition in the auction is much less at the moment than previous weeks
[9.12.25, 16:11:08] ~ Richard Nguyen: Ran on a regular BM that has been aged already.

We had lower CPMs when we started off earlier last week and it all of a sudden spiked up. Not sure what is causing this

Nothing else
[9.12.25, 21:21:21] ~ MR: if I remember well my CBO was at 9k$ daily budget when it happened. So I think it was targeting broad enough for that girl to see 😂

[10.12.25, 9:57:08] ~ Matt: We saw a slight dip week after BD but like 25% and then picked up following week. This year is still up on last year but % dip is like 60%
[10.12.25, 9:57:34] ~ Olly STFD: Were you more aggressive during BFCM this year?
[10.12.25, 9:57:49] ~ Matt: Not really it’s the same offer year round
[10.12.25, 9:58:00] ~ Matt: Just updated for sales period
[10.12.25, 9:58:26] ~ Matt: I’ll try an express shipping offer instead of discount as this can help gift buyers
[10.12.25, 11:05:17] ~ Olly STFD: If your brand is what I think it is then I am constantly getting hit with your ads so they are working really well. Maybe need to fine tune the offer for a push during a period where people are focusing on gifts.

Have you tried specific angles for gifting where its parents buying for teens/adult children?

[10.12.25, 17:04:04] ~ Dryden Byrd: When you guys get chargebacks, do you typically just let Shopify handle it or reach out to the customer about it
[10.12.25, 17:57:34] ~ James Moffat: If you let shopify handle it you will lose
[10.12.25, 18:48:12] ~ Dryden Byrd: So you reach out everytime ?
[10.12.25, 19:06:00] ~ John B: Naw you get a 3rd party app like Disputifier and they will either refund before the chargeback actually comes through or they will handle the case for you.
[10.12.25, 20:08:59] ~ Fes: And do you write copy yourself or with Claude AI? Whats the process if you dont mind asking

[10.12.25, 22:08:57] ~ Matt: Always with Claude, it takes some tweaking though and you need to make it check for congruency errors with long copy. I just upload a shitload of research on the product and audience + good marketing books in PDF format like eugene shwartz etc + any old winners if you have some as a reference and get it to analyse them
[10.12.25, 22:09:23] ~ Matt: Just make sure the copy matches the stage of awareness of the image you use

[11.12.25, 4:54:03] ~ Aamir Latif: Market ?
[11.12.25, 5:05:55] ~ Ryan Kamal: USA
[11.12.25, 6:39:36] ~ Roland: I am starting a new meta account for a client, he already has - im not kidding - around 400 concepts with variations each, around 1200 ads in total. Mix of statics and videos. 
How would you approach testing them?
If anyone knows someone or is an expert for this scale - also given this is a fresh account - id be happy to get some consulting going for this. 

My thoughts so far: 
- Presort them what we THINK subjectively will perform so we actually only test 20% of them. And then reevaluate from there which of the others we test and rather build iterations.
- ⁠Launch into CBO, 1 concept with all its variations per ad set
- ⁠Several CBOs for testing so Meta spreads out spend a bit, then consolidate winners from all these CBOs into TROAS & Bid Caps

Oh, and we also have multiple LPs lol. 

Advice is very welcome 🙌
[11.12.25, 6:42:26] ~ Roland: Some context: Brand is making 4m a year right now on amazon, tiktok and google
[11.12.25, 6:47:48] ~ Max: Weird re-direct to the checkout of this no-shipper:

https://noryyfashion.com/pages/new-mystery-box

Anyone that has an idea what this is and why he does that?
[11.12.25, 7:03:06] ~ Al: What's the testing budget and how many variations per concept?
[11.12.25, 7:03:28] ~ Al: Also does the product need a lot of education or is it easy to understand and there's already demand in the market?
[11.12.25, 7:12:42] ~ Roland: product market fit is there, keto food, 2-3 variations per concept, 1k/day testing
[11.12.25, 7:14:53] ~ Roland: theyre making 4m/yr off mostly amazon so theres definitely demand in the market
[11.12.25, 7:23:09] ~ Ezra Liran: Bro does anyone have an actual consistent way to take people down who are ripping your brand 1 to 1? Bustem is so ass and all these softwares are super trash. So frustrating ngl.
[11.12.25, 7:35:04] ~ Al: Option A: I'd probably start with ~20 concepts only and here's what I'd do:

- focus 70-80% on subjectively the best stage 3 concepts (solution aware/product unaware) with wide creative diversity
- have 1-2 of the best concepts max on the bottom stages (sales image ads/comparison ads)
- the rest on great and varied stg1/stg2 concepts (problem unaware // problem aware/solution unaware)

I would run ASC with 1 adset per concept and $20 minimum spend per adset ($400 locked, $600 free). Let them run for at least 5 days before starting to turn shit off.

Once a week, launch another 2-5 concepts as you turn 2-5 off.

Option B: ASC adsets work better with creative diversity inside directly, and flexible ads are working well for us. If you already know what works from other channels and are not as concerned about which specific variation of each concept worked best, you could:

- Create 1 adset for each stage of awareness (stg1-5)
- Dump ~20 flexible ads in each (total ~100 ads) - each with one concept and it's variations
- Give adsets for Stages 1-4 a low minimum spend like $50, so the campaign still has plenty of room to optimize spend as it sees fit
- Give Stage 5 a max spend (I'd suggest ~20% of budget to start with so it doesn't spend it all uselessly on BOF)
- Let it run for at least 5 days (ideally 1-2 weeks) and start turning off ads that spend but underperform. Don't touch ads that don't spend. Add new ones as you turn these off

I'd go with Option A if you weren't sure what angles/personas/hooks etc work yet, so slowly you can analyze each concept variation's performance.

I'd go with B if you somewhat knew and just wanted to lean more into Meta's optimization
[11.12.25, 7:35:45] ~ Al: Option A is our BAU and how we grew to 8figs basically. Option B is what we're currently testing against A and is performing better, BUT the ads are already heavily optimized and we know what works
[11.12.25, 7:38:17] ~ Al: You say Keto so I suggest more Stg3 because at 4M there's still a lot of market to capture that already knows about keto (I.e. I know I have a problem and I know keto could solve it but idk your brand). 

But if you lean more into capturing solution unaware people (i.e. I have XYZ problems but idk how to fix them = try keto) then obviously lean more into Stg2 ads
[11.12.25, 7:38:38] ~ Al: Oh I meant to reply to this
[11.12.25, 8:00:14] ~ Roland: @⁨~Al⁩ Thanks appreciate the input!
[11.12.25, 8:00:50] ~ Ezra Liran: Bro does anyone have an actual consistent way to take people down who are ripping your brand 1 to 1? Bustem is so ass and all these softwares are super trash. So frustrating ngl.
[11.12.25, 8:01:03] ~ Ezra Liran: Would really appreciate help with this super frustrating rn^

[11.12.25, 12:13:22] ~ Joel Cederlund: Dm
[11.12.25, 12:13:22] ~ James Moffat: If ad revival could stop removing the ad accounts randomly in the middle of the night and making us start fresh on new ones it would be them. But unfortunately they’re very unstable 🥲
[11.12.25, 12:13:58] ~ Jonny: yeah hearing similar things
[11.12.25, 12:59:37] ~ Yusuf: Hey, we're testing checkout champ instead of shopify and our Conversion Rate is half of what it was

We noticed that more than 50% of people were using Shop Pay for payment method, can this be the reason?

Is there anyone experienced same, how did you deal with the conversion rate drop?
[11.12.25, 13:33:51] ~ Mo: using search function for tiktok organic, how to get Tiktok to give results for a targeted specific country ? vpn works, proxy…?
[11.12.25, 15:23:18] ~ Ben Mansour: Do you know a theme that has many functionalities like shrine theme but looks more professional and branded

[11.12.25, 20:35:15] ~ Jacobo Uribe: /pages also works well for finding anything that’s not a Shopify product page, doesn’t have to be advertorials

Combine it with 3-5 star performance, limit 2 ads per brand

[12.12.25, 2:19:45] ~ Marc F: when testing multiple offers and multiple prelanders, do you test all of them in the same ABO campaign, and if you see thats performing good you create a CBO for it, or what strategy do you guys follow?
[12.12.25, 2:20:49] ~ Dryden Byrd: one cbo works for me
[12.12.25, 2:49:00] ~ Damjan Topalovic: ABO, cleaner results
[12.12.25, 2:49:55] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Goal is to separate variables as much as possible and have control over what spends

[12.12.25, 5:47:39] ~ Giovanni: Guys, for HK is it better to use Shopify payments or OceanPay? The only reason I wanted to use OceanPay is because of Klarna but I could also get Klarna through a UK Ltd
[12.12.25, 6:01:59] ~ Mo: i think u can get Klarna with SP too
[12.12.25, 6:02:41] ~ Faisal Sidiqi: happened as well, anyone w good recs?

[12.12.25, 18:08:04] ~ Ben Mansour: try to change ad account
[12.12.25, 18:09:22] ~ RS: My cpms Also went up to 500$ in december
[12.12.25, 18:09:29] ~ RS: Still scaling tho
[12.12.25, 18:09:35] ~ Guy Edan: I’m 99% it’s not the ad account or fb page cause I tested it on our main ad account that has a lot of spend behind and has our main brand running there with healthy CPMs
[12.12.25, 18:09:54] ~ Guy Edan: What CTR and CPC are you seeing?
[12.12.25, 18:10:05] ~ Mohit Uppal: Afaik go to events - data set -> manage settings -> check if your domain got flagged
[12.12.25, 18:10:58] ~ RS: CTR 4-8%, CPC 2-5$
[12.12.25, 18:11:25] ~ danny: what niche ?
[12.12.25, 18:11:33] ~ MR: U gotta have high aov to stay profitable with those metrics😭
[12.12.25, 18:11:37] ~ Guy Edan: Will check that. Thanks
[12.12.25, 18:11:42] ~ Guy Edan: Supplements
[12.12.25, 18:11:59] ~ danny: hmm i must be lucky this new test 😭
[12.12.25, 18:12:17] ~ danny: cpms are $80 for me in us for supplement
[12.12.25, 18:12:55] ~ Guy Edan: That’s great. When did you launch? I’m wondering if it’s a December thing
[12.12.25, 18:13:03] ~ POVILAS: Anybody else here sells sarms or peptides ?
[12.12.25, 18:13:18] ~ danny: recently so it might make a difference
[12.12.25, 18:13:26] ~ POVILAS: Hmu
[12.12.25, 18:13:47] ~ danny: what peptides u takin
[12.12.25, 18:13:47] ~ MR: 2 supplements i run rn cpms under 40$ 

And one i launched 3 weeks ago
[12.12.25, 18:14:25] ~ Ben Mansour: usa?
[12.12.25, 18:14:30] ~ danny: mine was launched today i won’t lie 😭
[12.12.25, 18:15:11] ~ MR: I excluded the USA, but I just started to test it in a separated CBO and CPM’s around 45
[12.12.25, 18:15:34] ~ Guy Edan: Are you in supplements in the US by any chance?
[12.12.25, 18:16:59] ~ Guy Edan: That’s great. I wonder what’s causing these high CPMs. I had a product I tested last year that no matter what had 200-300. I tried pretty much everything for months and although it was decently profitable, it was too hard to scale with 5-6/CPC. Now again with this new supplements test
[12.12.25, 18:18:16] ~ danny: could be pixel or some shit then, or ur smacking same avatar and angles which is cookin it
[12.12.25, 18:19:04] ~ SA: From the very beginning or did it start high and eventually come down?
[12.12.25, 18:19:40] ~ MR: They were like 70-80 and after a week or so went down
[12.12.25, 18:26:50] ~ SA: Ok cool, I launched a pet supp today (hate this niche lmao). Img Ads only. Mixed CPMs of $200 to $30 in the same ABO, 1 sale after $50 spend so far. 
New Ad Account with a few $100s spend on it.
[12.12.25, 18:35:04] ~ POVILAS: sellin
[12.12.25, 18:35:25] ~ Nikola: Hi guys, has anyone used ROAS goal? What's your experience with it?
[12.12.25, 18:45:51] ~ Fes: Guys when you test ads did anyone try setting bid caps for target CPA and is it good to do it when testing so then fb will not even spend if it thinks it cant find a customer for that price?
[12.12.25, 19:14:13] ~ Damjan Topalovic: nah bro, bid caps only when you’re trying to scale
[12.12.25, 20:05:37] ~ Christopher Murphy: What is the average watch time you guys aim for on 10-15 min VSL ads?
[12.12.25, 21:09:30] ~ Igor Botelho: What’s good, gang?

[12.12.25, 21:57:14] Malachi: Does anyone notice performance dip or rise depending on the number of active campaigns you have going? is it better to just have a couple or can you run multiple multiple campaigns at a time
[12.12.25, 21:59:55] Malachi: Secondly, for testing are you guys seeing more results with ABO or CBO? are you running any cost caps or bids?
[12.12.25, 22:11:05] ~ David: is anyone using wetracked?

Please lmk if you know anybody looking for work
[13.12.25, 8:27:23] ~ harshil Thummar: Any one facing issue with cost caps recently?
[13.12.25, 9:11:47] ~ Sairaj: What sort of issues?
[13.12.25, 9:12:40] ~ harshil Thummar: Performance is very much down suddenly from last week and not spending much
[13.12.25, 10:00:56] ~ Alexander: I would say similar, but CRO optimized sections
[13.12.25, 11:08:47] ~ Giovanni: Hey guys, would you say that gummies are always better than tablets? Or it doesn’t matter if the supplement works
[13.12.25, 11:19:38] ~ Rustam: Not all supps can be made in a gummy form. Best is if you actually choose a form which gives best absorption. If it’s in a gummy or in powder form that dissolves really well, then you also have an additional mechanism you can rely on in your marketing ‎<This message was edited>
[13.12.25, 11:21:34] ~ Rustam: I personally take like 10+ supps regularly, and I hate pills honestly, and powders that dissolve badly and have a bad taste
[13.12.25, 11:23:39] ~ Giovanni: Very interesting, thank you. ChatGPT says that this type of supplement is usually made in pills because it needs an high concentration (500-1000mg )

But I think that making it a gummy could be a good way to differentiate. However, if they always made them in pills, there’s probably a reason haha
[13.12.25, 11:26:05] ~ Giovanni: And also guys, if there is someone that’s selling supplements in Europe that I could ask a couple questions to, would be very appreciated 🙏🏻
[13.12.25, 11:32:15] ~ Erne: Go check your avatar what prefer
[13.12.25, 11:32:32] ~ Erne: Many brands start crushing after just switching from one to another
[13.12.25, 11:33:03] ~ Erne: Also, if all your competitors are selling through pills, selling it through gummies can give you a good differentiator, or viceversa ofc ‎<This message was edited>
[13.12.25, 11:33:22] ~ Erne: I would make your choice based on research of your avatar honestly
[13.12.25, 13:33:10] ~ Phil: Does anyone have a very good shoe manufacturer in China to make custom shoes/sandals etc ??

[13.12.25, 16:21:46] ~ Felix: Do you know any checkout alternatives to Shopify like

funnelish
checkoutchamp
tagadapay

that can be utilized for ecom and commerce in general?

Currently working on a really direct response funnel and want to sort through all different checkout alternatives there are
[13.12.25, 16:22:50] ~ Felix: It's not black hat - just a really low price product so CVR and testing needs to be top notch
[13.12.25, 16:47:48] ~ Matthew Martorano: Felix, hit me up.
[13.12.25, 17:01:58] ~ Jonny: Can anyone recommend a good agency acc provider?

[13.12.25, 20:20:56] ~ Mo Ecom: Yes have a direct contact with the nominees
[13.12.25, 22:19:20] ~ Jakub: Hey guys, what is your experience with Hyros vs standard Meta-Shopify CAPI integration for ads? I am currently running my site on Shopify with ads optimized for standard Meta CAPI Purchase event, but also use tracking via parameter in Hyros. I still see differences in the ads tracking side tho. Which one do you think is more reliable and accurate? Do you think Meta integration digs deeper than just first/last click? What is your experience? Thank you !!! 🙏
[13.12.25, 23:06:51] ~ POVILAS: Anybody sell peptides here ? would love to talk
[14.12.25, 1:36:48] ~ Omar: Any Facebook ads uploading tool that allows you to upload a thumbnail photo?
[14.12.25, 8:47:39] ~ Chris Ciofalo: Anyone running subscriptions what retry interval have you seen work the best for failed payments going through
[14.12.25, 10:07:09] ~ Mikael: YO! anyone have any experience or knowledge about when stopping ads for more than 14 days and then launching agian. 
Our performance and Roas was super good and high before. but then we got some payment issues and fixed now. So we duplicated and relaunched ads in lower spend. (The performance is awful now).

We launched 2 different products in 4 different countries at the same time. dont know if we would have launched just 1 campaign in 1 country?
[14.12.25, 10:07:28] ~ Mikael: First and second day performance was super high. but then we fell off a cliff and the performance have not gotten any better.
[14.12.25, 10:24:44] ~ Sairaj: Same thing with one of our clients.. super high roas and performance.. got an ad acc banned.. and cpc has sky rocketed on new accounts ever since:(
[14.12.25, 10:29:45] ~ Mert M: Hello team.
Anyone know a person who can get you instagram usernames of accounts what is not in use anymore.

Want to choose instagram usernames for my new brands.

Thanks in advance
[14.12.25, 10:29:50] ~ Mikael: Hmm did they not recover? We have everything the same. Pixel. Ad account etc.
[14.12.25, 10:36:13] ~ Sairaj: Not yet.. it keeps getting worse every next day.. 

We tried the same pixel, pages as well as new pixel, pages.. including creatives 

Seems like a shadow ban
[14.12.25, 10:36:59] ~ Sairaj: We’re going to test a new domain, page, ad account now.. will keep posted
[14.12.25, 11:39:35] ~ Mikael: Hmn okey. I dont see why we would have a shadow ban as only the ads were paused due to payment processor issues on site
[14.12.25, 13:00:22] ~ Fes: Hey guys, hope you are doing great. I have one question about ad accounts. I already run ads in US, UK and CAD, but wanted to do Europe now to test my winners there also, so what do you think should I do another Ad account just for Europe or I should just create new Campaign and there do Europe, what are your toughts? Any tips on this one much appreciated!

[14.12.25, 16:24:39] ~ Vivaan: Gemini always. But ChatGPT has better memory
[14.12.25, 16:42:44] ~ Gigi: Hi guys, I'm asking this question to everyone who works with Shopify post-purchase. Over the last 60 days, I had an average of €6 per visitor. Over the last two days, the average has dropped to €1.80 WITHOUT CHANGING OR MODIFYING ANYTHING AT ALL. I spoke to a friend of mine and he had the exact same problem (different apps, different countries, different niche, I'm a woman, he's a man). Could I ask if any of you have experienced this drastic drop in the last 2 days? Maybe it could be down to Shopify (?). It's impossible that in 2 days the exact same funnel could drop by 70% without any changes.

They claim to clear internal flags on your Meta Assets, raise HIVA score etc… which should result in better CPMs/performance.

Is this all bullshit or is there any truth behind this?

[15.12.25, 18:34:47] Carlos Leeseman: Our HIVA was already best tier
[15.12.25, 18:35:01] Carlos Leeseman: So I don’t know to be honest
[15.12.25, 18:35:18] Carlos Leeseman: But if you pay insider, he can just increase it hahah

Never stopped spending like that. Literally my champion ad set with 0 spend. and Meta forcing spend on other creatives.
[16.12.25, 19:20:49] ~ Charles: (We run one CBO only)
[16.12.25, 19:21:15] ~ MR: Both stores for the past few days are doing dog shit
[16.12.25, 19:21:19] ~ Charles: Tried forcing spend with minimum and meta still spend 0 on them
[16.12.25, 19:48:13] ~ Daniel: Yeah I had this too a few months ago, min spend rules didn’t work either, didn’t find a fix, tried new CBO and it spent on top spenders at first, but then same thing happened again and again, it went back to normal after a few weeks, still don’t know what cause it
[16.12.25, 19:54:24] ~ Charles: That’s scary man
[16.12.25, 19:54:50] ~ Charles: and it went back to normal in your main camp too?
[16.12.25, 19:56:08] ~ Daniel: no I had to kill my main camp because it went crazy and roas dropped by a lot, so I started a new one & replaced all links, lost all social proof, but at least it was spending on my previous top spenders, not sure if this is the right way, but it’s what I did

[16.12.25, 22:49:36] ~ Austin: I still test everything in ABO, than move it to CBO if winner
[16.12.25, 23:01:28] ~ MR: Both tried, both works.

But if I have to choose one, then I’d say ABO, I don’t trust Zuck shit

[18.12.25, 16:55:47] ~ Marc F: we use Triple Whale for attribution, and with native ads we frequently observe conversions being tracked in Meta but not reflected in Triple Whale. This occurs despite proper UTM implementation, and it appears to be specific to native ads. The discrepancy persists regardless of the attribution model used (TA model, first click, or last click)
[18.12.25, 16:56:10] ~ Marc F: should we “trust” meta data? or kill as usual according to TW data?
[18.12.25, 19:25:49] ~ Daniel: hey guys, for those running 1 CBO

If you have 2 winning LPs, do you run them in the same CBO and let Fb spend on the one he likes more?
[18.12.25, 21:43:56] ~ Danny: I think TW data is more accurate. Facebook often takes credit for conversions that came through other traffic sources
[18.12.25, 21:44:55] ~ MR: It was promised to facebook 3000 years ago
[18.12.25, 21:49:58] ~ Roland: Yeah
[19.12.25, 0:19:12] ~ John B: Hey guys, I run a custom POD store,  we got a lot of new winning ads for Q4, the vid hooks and primary texts on these ads are evergreen, I want to add new primary texts + headlines to just roll over these winners for Valentines but I know it’s going to reset engagement. Should I just launch them with new headlines + primary texts  in Jan or leave them be
[19.12.25, 2:13:07] ~ Matt: Apparently voluum works way better for native ads. This is coming from a contact managing a multi 8 fig brand on native
[19.12.25, 2:38:05] ~ Omar: What do u guys pay ur video editors per month 

And how many minutes of content you getting?
[19.12.25, 4:32:42] ~ Mithiran: We just switched everyone from monthly salary to job basis. $45 per UGC video. We used to pay 1.5k per month but output was really bad after a couple months.
[19.12.25, 4:36:40] ~ Austin: I pay my editors quite a lot as I’m looking to get the absolute highest quality I can. Both my editors are from the Philippines and with A $1100 monthly salary plus ROAS bonuses they typically get just under $2000 a month. These people are true A players as someone who’s  personally edited hundreds of videos themselves, these editors can probably output 2 to 3 times where I ever could, and almostly always a higher quality. When they started out, they were getting paid by the job of $30 per video that average about two minutes. I would highly suggest a salary plus a ROAS bonus.
[19.12.25, 5:11:50] ~ Mithiran: How much do you guys pay for bookkeeping monthly?
[19.12.25, 5:31:56] ~ Carlos: Around 500 USD, but my company is based in Portugal. That figure will vary wildly depending on volume, location and jurisdiction ‎<This message was edited>

[19.12.25, 5:35:18] ~ Carlos: Around 5 million/year
[19.12.25, 5:35:37] ~ Carlos: Has anyone here worked with some actual branding agencies? I mean real ones, not “ecom agencies” from 19 year olds ahah
[19.12.25, 6:07:25] ~ Mo: used to post organically for my brand on tiktok ( 35k) and IG ( 12K) and i got good reach, been travelling and changing location last months, and targetting and reach is completely fucked now ( it targets countries where im currently in, not country where im selling ) this even with proxies etc… anyone went throught that ? 

anyone have a brand, post organically and noticed this when changing location or travelling ?

[19.12.25, 15:38:15] ~ Sairaj: Hey guys, We’re running into a Meta ads issue and wanted to get opinions.

The client has two brands. The ad account was originally used for the old brand, which is no longer operating. We’ve now launched a new brand, but we’re trying to use the same ad account for it.

What’s odd is:
	•	If we turn ON the old brand’s campaigns, they start spending immediately.
	•	But when we create new campaigns for the new brand, they either stay in processing for a long time or go active and don’t spend at all. It’s been 3 days now 

We even tried running page likes and engagement but still no spend at all

Has anyone dealt with something like this before?

How can I figure out which acquisition channel they come from?

For tracking, I use the Google app and Omega for Facebook.

[23.12.25, 16:41:27] ~ Aleksander: You’ll definitely have some overlap between these platforms and its okay. The same person can interact with your brand and ads on different platforms. you can use Last or First click attribution in TripleWhale to see it without any overlap
[23.12.25, 16:44:49] ~ m: Yep I had this when I went to turkey. Had to go via a friend’s fb rep to get access back as 2FA was blocked by them and they kept asking for 2FA. Mad time.

give that profile access to ur bm and just use that when ur abroad

Whats your thoughts on this?

Or I can just have as many campaigns as I want?

AdsPower is the most budget friendly & ecom friendly (still really good option) - it should be good now tbh they were target of a CryptoHack
OxyLabs if you're doing something at very large scale and need advanced infrastructure, also most expensive ‎<This message was edited>

And have never done any research or tried applying any credit cards.

But since I am already spending multi 6 figs per month on ads, I guess applying for credit card will have lot of benefits.

Do you guys know any good ones I can apply for qantas points, and ones that gives good limit easily?

[25.12.25, 14:33:26] ~ Giovanni: That’s because Google and Meta often track  the same sale, because maybe one person after seeing the ad goes on Google searching for the brand. That’s very annoying because my Google ROAS is 3x but probably it would be 1.5 without counting the people who saw the ad from Meta first (and the same thing to the opposite)

After he filled this all out, the customer pays and we get all the info with his order so it can be customized.

[28.12.25, 15:23:22] ~ A: I had a call with a CRO / Mediabuyer who does real big numbers and Roas for big brands in the Netherlands. He really does recommend using the pixel of Meta itself (if you’re using Meta) instead of using third party tracking.
[28.12.25, 15:24:10] ~ A: So he recommends using the connection between meta and shopify instead of having third party tracking

[28.12.25, 23:04:23] ~ Elad daskal: if you wanna’ track performance -> outside trackers will always be more accurate (and adjustable to what and how you wanna’ track stuff)
but tracking and feeding data to the platform isn’t the same thing.
for all platforms (not just meta) we always use both 3rd party trackers and feeding the pixel with S2S data and as many events as possible.
[28.12.25, 23:09:16] ~ Alexander: Are you running some brand(s) in the EU market?
[28.12.25, 23:33:51] ~ Elad daskal: UK
[28.12.25, 23:34:01] ~ Alexander: Cool
[29.12.25, 2:46:49] ~ A: He told me that it is important also that have to look into things objectively also. Who do you think has a better data tracking system. Multi billion dollar companys like Meta and Shopify or a company with around 50 employees like Wetracked. 

He asked Wetracked also questions about how they say they are able to track customers with adblocks (because they advertise this) because when. He looks at those sales on Wetracked it says unknown instead of from which ad they came from. They never got back to him with a response
[29.12.25, 2:52:43] ~ A: He also changed my whole mindset on marketing with Meta. I was doing general fashion, even though I was doing good revenue. With how Meta is designed I’ve decided to start a brand (which is new for me) instead of building and killing stores every few months.

I’ve learned that Meta is more than broad cbo 5-10 creatives 😅. That being said, Meta is really build for brands and having long term customers instead of getting to the sale immediately
[29.12.25, 2:53:38] ~ A: General fashion is great for Google though
[29.12.25, 3:00:18] ~ A: He also really targets his audience (based on data) on Meta instead of giving full control to Andromeda. He told me when he let Andromeda do the work for him he lost money. I can say it worked out pretty well for him

[29.12.25, 4:28:39] ~ Al: Keep your money
[29.12.25, 4:29:08] ~ Al: Meta is enough for us at 8 figures and would only consider a GOOD MMM like Northbeam when we start being properly omnichannel

[29.12.25, 11:21:54] ~ Cocow: It is only direct tracking via utms so not really I guess. It works as « last click » and probably someone coming from SEO for example but mainly knowing your brand as per a meta ad then you cannot really check this way in my opinion
[29.12.25, 11:23:34] ~ Marc F: fuck I feel like Im totally blind right now
[29.12.25, 11:24:46] ~ Marc F: for those running native ads, aren’t you experiencing tracking issues?

[29.12.25, 11:33:13] ~ Cocow: If you use shopify taboola tracking should be quite okey on the platform. The way you are doing right now with UtM campaigns is exactly the same as before so you are not blind , but you miss maybe an eye
[29.12.25, 11:33:57] ~ Marc F: Makes sense

[29.12.25, 15:20:23] ~ Ben Mansour: Mmm no idea then, maybe because these native ads keep targeting new audiences and raising awarness, but most people convert from other ads, but facebook attributes all sales to it, ta should be the closest to facebook

[29.12.25, 21:26:31] ~ Steve: we do product seeding, we do a lot of A.I. UGC, we straight hire creators to do scripts, soon trying to do whitelisting at scale
[29.12.25, 21:44:24] ~ M.Y: Hope everyone’s well. Quick advice request:

I run about 90% of my Meta budget through one main broad campaign ($3–5k/day). It has 8 active ad sets. Each ad set has 3 variations, with 1 ad per ad set. The top 3 ad sets have been running for 1+ year and have heavy social proof (10k+ likes, 1,000+ comments), so they dominate spend. ROAS isn’t crazy; it’s decent but slowly declining over time, and it’s definitely starting to fatigue, especially lately.

When I try to test new creatives inside this main campaign, they almost never get a real chance to compete with the older ads. My assumption is the engagement and social proof on the old ads is giving them a big advantage.

How would you recommend structuring creative testing here? Should I run a separate testing campaign and push 20+ creatives/week through it, then duplicate winners into the main campaign? Or should I start siphoning budget away from the old campaign over time? Any thoughts would be appreciated.
[29.12.25, 21:53:43] ~ Kyle Twohill: I had this exact same problem. This strategy worked for about a year for me. I just created a new abo testing campaign.  Then I would put winners into this cbo if they were proven, as well as scaled them in their own CBOs with manual bidding.
[29.12.25, 21:54:19] ~ Kyle Twohill: Gurus had me believing in the one CBO strategy in my experience I get better performance running multiple campaigns. Especially with manual bidding
[29.12.25, 21:57:33] ~ SA: How much do you typically pay for UGC vids on the platform? It’s $500/month + 10% fee + creator payment ? ‎<This message was edited>

The flagship product is a unique, easy-to-use scratch removal kit something that consistently gets strong reactions from customers and performs well in paid media.

We recently developed a simplified version of the kit that can potentially increase AOV and sell better on Amazon but we haven’t launched it yet.

	•	$243K+ in total sales
	•	~30% net profit margin
	•	$33K in ready-to-ship inventory (retail value $250K+)
	•	Shopify store, product assets, and supplier relationships included
	•	Great product-market fit with room to scale

We’re shifting focus to other niches DM Me if your are interested

[31.12.25, 4:55:56] ~ Mike Ramsey: It’s helps slightly but Shopify isn’t making most of their money off Plus subscription revenue - you have to keep in mind Shopify is a payments company first and makes >60% of their revenue via SP.

You want to keep dispute ratios and overall risk profile in line with any package but they will bend for you slightly on Plus if you do a ton of volume.  Dedicated AM helps too once good volume is established 

On the flip side. I’ve seen a WH 9 figure year brand shut down on SP with good dispute rates.  It’s all over the place IMO and best practice is that SP / Plus is best for local entity <> local customers and established, seasoned account ‎<This message was edited>

[31.12.25, 19:40:37] ~ Jakub: Hey guys, is there a way to get a specific Reddit thread down? Some people are sharing fake bad reviews (did not even purchase my product f.e.) and people are commenting on it and not purchasing my product because of that.
[31.12.25, 19:43:51] ~ Giovanni: Hey guys, for those of you who have an Hong Kong company , how did you go over The problem of cards declined from the US?
[31.12.25, 20:02:57] ~ Mo Ecom: What processor? OP?
[31.12.25, 20:11:45] ~ Giovanni: Shopify payments but potentially I could switch to OP, I didn’t get a proposal yet
[31.12.25, 20:12:40] ~ Giovanni: And I’m selling in Europe right now with no problems with card declines but as far as I know it happens with the US
[31.12.25, 20:33:11] ~ Mike Ramsey: You will have higher decline rates on any cross border transaction unless you process through a merchant of record or you establish an entity in that region. 

These sales may flag as fraud at a US cardholder’s bank if they interact / purchase with a foreign entity such as HK.   It’s a false decline in most cases even though the transaction is legit.

If you have established / proven sales in the US, probably worth it to look at setting up an entity there and then routing transactions through the US entity vs. HK.  You’ll see an almost instant uplift in approvals (>10% in most cases)
[31.12.25, 21:03:55] ~ Giovanni: Guys if I create a funnel to test a new product and I connect that to my other brand’s Shopify just to test the product out, of course it’s going to be very messy but it’ll be fine right? Or maybe I will just create a new Shopify store under the same account without overcomplicating things hahah

[1.01.26, 19:35:16] ~ Mithiran: hey guys how do u deal with editors being extremely slow, I know that they can do the work 2-3x faster and its slowing down the whole process. How do we keep them accountable?
[1.01.26, 19:47:05] ~ R: had the same case and tried a few things like tutorials from other good editors or give him a bonus system for more drive

but in the end nothing really worked so I had to replace him and its a lot better now

in my opinion you have to be ruthless about this if it slows down everything

generally I think a good editor hire is worth so much, so you should be a bit picky with it
[1.01.26, 19:47:55] ~ Alexander: Replace them

[1.01.26, 20:15:48] ~ SA: Anyone in the ecomtalent shop for video editing? How is it overall? Good for learning some skills yourself ?
[2.01.26, 1:57:24] ~ Value Adding Personality: I would not fire him outright. I would get on a call, have an honest conversation, and understand what is really going on. If needed, issue a clear warning and expectations. I have seen situations like this before. In one case, a call revealed the person was grieving the loss of a parent. We gave him time off, and he returned stronger and more committed. In another case, performance dropped because founders had created bottlenecks. Every decision required their approval, approvals took forever, and yet results were still expected. Motivation died, not talent.

Be human first. Termination should be the last option, not the first reaction. Give people time and a fair chance to improve. Many of you have bad ads running right now, yet you do not “fire” Meta. You analyze what went wrong, adjust, and allow room for optimization. Treat people with the same patience and logic, thank me later.

my ads are performing in some kind of waves right now, they perform better and better over the timeframe of 3 hours and then suddenly it crashes to almost zero and then it builds up again

happened 3 times today 

maybe it is worth testing a new ad account?
[2.01.26, 20:02:06] ~ David: guys what would you say is a good post purchase take rate?

[3.01.26, 20:04:56] ~ Marc F: what are your thoughts on flexible ads? we always test creatives doing 1 + 3 variations (usually simple hook variations). should we switch to testing with flexible ads? If so, whats the right strategy to follow
[3.01.26, 20:16:39] ~ Moonis Ali: What I have noticed is with flexible ads you gotta be a little patient. It might not perform for 6-7 days but once it starts working it works great.
[3.01.26, 20:21:02] ~ Manoj Bashyal: if you’re testing just a hook variation to the same concept, flexible ads perform the best. ‎<This message was edited>

I had a convo with my Friends about CBO Testing Structure. When launching a completely new product, do you start by testing with a Big 4 CBO (US, UK, CA, AU), or do you begin with a US-only CBO? I’ve heard many different opinions on whether testing Big 4 from the start. I personally test Big 4 for last months but also did us only
[4.01.26, 0:14:40] ~ Charles: I do Big 4. Always have been better for us

I wonder if there is an app to export in csv, translate manually  and import it back?

[7.01.26, 12:23:02] ~ Sean: if it’s targeting different countries as well, can make a dupe website and translate it. will also increase that country cvr and you could also translate your winners and launch them to that specific site as well
[7.01.26, 12:23:07] Topi: With markets you just need someone like developer to translate some button / text here and there from code

[7.01.26, 14:19:48] ~ Steph: 🚀 Quick Google Ads win we just wrapped up at More Than Scaling

We took one of our own internal owned brands from ~$300/day → $75k/day in 58 days using only Google Ads.

No FB. No TikTok. Just clean structure + execution.

What moved the needle:
* Geo-based campaign segmentation (US/CA focus)
* Aggressive PMax + feed-only setups
* Product variant testing inside Shopping
* Demand Gen + remarketing layered properly

End result: $1.2M revenue, ~4x ROAS.

Sharing the full breakdown here 👇
👉 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l_MKsR8MM5xmhQ3Z38eBhsufyVDSMS2GJxw4ha46qXY/edit?tab=t.0

This is exactly why we run our own brands, we test first, then roll out what actually works.

I’m Looking for an E-commerce Growth Manager for a D2C brand. Not a media buyer — need someone who can actually run the whole growth engine.

You'd be doing funnel strategy (advertorials, VSLs, listicles), writing direct-response copy, running CRO/A/B tests, doing competitor research, and giving strategic direction on paid media (mainly Meta).

Need 3+ years in D2C (not Amazon), experience managing $50k+/mo in ad spend, and solid skills in funnels, copywriting, and analytics. English fluency required.

Compensation 3K-5K per month + Bonuses.

Shoot me a message if you are interested or know someone who might be a good fit.

Are you just turning off ads or reducing spend by a lot?

[8.01.26, 20:31:31] ~ Bryan T: Forecast out inventory needs and just buy it ahead of time, although for certain factories you’ve already missed the deadline
[8.01.26, 20:31:45] ~ Emanuel Sabelsjö: Yeah, buying stock upfront to cover the period where your factory is off. Agents normally shouldn’t be away for more than a few days
[8.01.26, 20:31:56] ~ SA: Yeah, tricky situation for me, I have 150 SKUs  🤣😭 they also told me a lot of factories are pretty much closing down entirely the time
[8.01.26, 20:32:36] ~ Bryan T: Yeah makes the forecasting a nightmare but AI has made it way easier, just remember that some inventory is better than nothing
[8.01.26, 20:34:35] ~ Bryan T: From my experience even if you only get half the needed stock to last, so let’s say it’s 3-4 weeks till your items ship, you can just update your pdp ship from date and get by without the conversion rate dropping too much

We recently learned of a disruption within our system. Upon discovery, we immediately began working with our IT staff and third-party forensic specialists to commence a thorough investigation of the nature and scope of this incident. Please know that our team is diligently working around the clock to resolve this disruption and to minimize service interruptions wherever possible.
 
We appreciate your patience as we continue to investigate this matter.  We will provide additional information as soon as we are able.

To our knowledge, this issue is currently contained as we have temporarily disabled the ability for refunds to be processed from our app and changed API tokens. 

If you were impacted, we highly recommend that you contact Shopify Payments or your payment processor to stop any refunds that were processed. It is important that you do this as soon as possible. 

You can reach out to me directly (+1 9193206869 or mark@disputifier.com). Although information is limited at this time, we will share updates as they become available.

There is currently no action needed from you to prevent this from occurring on your store. Again, based on our current knowledge, we believe the issue has been contained at this time.

[10.01.26, 5:44:28] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Sent you a dm
[10.01.26, 5:47:16] ~ Steph: With Disputely, there will never be any gap in coverage - you stay active with your current provider until you're fully operational
[10.01.26, 5:48:03] ~ Nicolas Business: fade chargeblast better
[10.01.26, 5:51:34] ~ Steph: Chargeblast is solid, but Disputely usually edges it, cheaper alerts and slightly higher prevention.
[10.01.26, 6:42:55] ~ 🥇: One of my friends was using Disputifier and deleted it after knowing about the hack issue. Now he’s unsure whether chargeback alerts will still be refunded automatically. He tried switching to another app, but was told that the enrollment is still active with Disputifier. For those who were using Disputifier, what did you do in this situation to keep handling alerts?
[10.01.26, 6:54:16] ~ AK: So it’s better to stop using disputifier and switch to someone else? Or they already fixed the issue?
[10.01.26, 7:12:51] ~ Mark Wagner: Hi Mark here founder of Disputifier, there is no ongoing issues. If you ensure that we have an active collaborator account on Shopify, refunds will continue to be processed and alert coverage will remain high. For any questions or concerns, please reach out to me. We are committed to restoring trust and confidence and appreciate your understanding with these circumstances.

[10.01.26, 9:57:18] ~ Mark Wagner: We are still working on restoring access for new installations - however, as long as our collaborator account is active, chargeback alerts will function as normal. We hope to get normal services including app reinstallations up and running as soon as possible!

[10.01.26, 21:07:40] ~ J: Dont think so, just use tracking software that’s it
[10.01.26, 23:47:17] ~ danny: hmm what does this mean exactly? i just checked mine aswell and prior to the 5th it was 90% or more and after the 5th its cut in half to 30-40%
[10.01.26, 23:47:19] ~ danny: prior to this though its always been 90% or higher
[10.01.26, 23:50:30] ~ danny: or is it just not tracking correct?
like my ad account is showing way less landing page views than my clarity is showing for landing page views
[10.01.26, 23:50:34] ~ danny: is it just a tracking problem on metas end then?
[10.01.26, 23:52:35] ~ Kyle Twohill: Oh wow, mine dropped from 75% to 30%

[11.01.26, 12:54:53] ~ Alex Usovs: Depends on how your cart is structured, if there is nothing in the cart, such as additional upsells, or social proof or anything, I don’t see point of having one extra step/click. 

If however, your cart serves purpose, then it’s worth testing what is more important. ‎<This message was edited>

[12.01.26, 1:17:32] ~ Richard Nguyen: No, just need help getting one of my accounts unbanned / or pre-approved and a referral for my other brand
[12.01.26, 3:21:20] ~ Wouter: What’s the best company to help with chargebacks?

[12.01.26, 16:17:56] ~ Matt: A Chinese company registered our brand trademark in China (we have registrations everywhere else). What can be done in this situation if anything? Nothing has happened so far but I don’t want to count on that long term. My main concern is having shipments blocked at ports
[12.01.26, 16:19:11] ~ Matt: Iv been getting a lot of spam emails saying the same thing. Thought I’d mention in case it’s the same for you.
[12.01.26, 16:21:20] ~ m: Same. I searched on the Chinese trademark site and couldn’t find it there
[12.01.26, 16:27:16] ~ Damiano: In the case it’s a real registration and not a fake one, the trademark law defends the first one who registered the trade mark. But you can contact them through your lawyer to let them know that you have more trademark history from your side (that is a good negotiation point) and maybe you can negotiate with them
[12.01.26, 16:28:18] ~ Damiano: This is according to my experience for a trademark I closely work with ‎<This message was edited>
[12.01.26, 16:28:22] ~ SA: Chinese companies (your suppliers) try to file for fake trademarks all the time they’re scum like that
[12.01.26, 16:28:54] ~ Mo Ecom: They can easily block shipments at the port anytime! 

I have been saying this to a lot of people in my network since 2018 to get your trademarks in China asap!

Seen a lot of shady and bad stuff from Chinese sellers already
[12.01.26, 16:28:57] ~ SA: You can get your TM if you have sufficient proof you actually used it first ‎<This message was edited>
[12.01.26, 16:40:21] ~ Matt: Yh it looks real filed 2 years ago
[12.01.26, 16:40:36] ~ Matt: We’ve been selling under that brand for 3+ years
[12.01.26, 16:41:04] ~ Matt: I wonder if the way round this is to just not use brand name on export info
[12.01.26, 16:41:15] ~ Matt: ATM it has our registered business info
[12.01.26, 16:41:21] ~ Matt: So no way to even see it
[12.01.26, 17:13:29] ~ Olly STFD: Hey Matt, talk with these guys as they are in UK and can give free 20 min consultation: https://www.trademarkbrothers.com/

I haven’t used them before as I decided to register my own but they were very experienced and impressive from the talks we had so I am sure they can advise you.
[12.01.26, 17:28:42] ~ Jakub: Hey guys, is there a contact for a good Stripe insider that would help with verification of my account? It has been unverified for "risk" reasons, although I don't do anything risky. Thanks !!

[13.01.26, 9:47:12] ~ Davide: did you guys have seen better results doing scriptwriting with gemini 3 then Claude?
[13.01.26, 10:22:18] Carlos Leeseman: Depends on the promping, but yeah Gemini is sometimes bit more creative and less robotic
[13.01.26, 10:22:33] ~ David: fuck no
[13.01.26, 10:35:13] ~ Steve: Gemini for research/data/ads analysis inside properly built Gems

Claude for copy inside properly built projects
[13.01.26, 10:35:22] ~ Steve: GPT for normies
[13.01.26, 10:38:38] ~ Diletta: Speking about AI, do any of you use NotebookLM to manage your niche information searches?
[13.01.26, 11:16:16] ~ Andrew Cerami: Anyone know how or have any connects to get a credit line on meta, so invoicing is every 30 days

I’m spending over $1M /m and somehow can’t get in touch with anyone at meta

Will pay anyone who can help get it done ✅
[13.01.26, 11:26:26] ~ Jeremy Khattar: Best way is the normal channels. Insiders these days are more scams then actually helpful. 

Or use an agency that allows you to do invoicing through their credit line
[13.01.26, 11:31:23] ~ Nicolò: Does anyone have a good app for quiz funnels? I tried Heyflow, but it costs $1,000 a month for only 5,000 responses.

[13.01.26, 11:33:37] ~ Christopher Murphy: Anyone else performance on meta been shit since iOS 26 on Jan 6?
[13.01.26, 11:34:13] ~ Christopher Murphy: We’re seeing same thing across all our accounts. Landing page view/outbound clicks went from 90%+ to 30%
[13.01.26, 11:34:26] ~ Manoj Bashyal: Not really, we are scaling at 5x roas even at $1m/mo spend.
[13.01.26, 11:36:27] ~ Andrew Cerami: Idk if it’s that because pretty much everyone in the health niche is seeing this issue but other niches I don’t think as much. Probably a meta issue again this happened before a few months ago it dropped to around 50% for a week or two then went back up to 90+
[13.01.26, 11:37:12] ~ Andrew Cerami: Wdym by normal channels?
[13.01.26, 11:53:58] ~ Andrew Cerami: Might actually be a change they made to Safari, google chrome tracks fine still on our end
[13.01.26, 12:01:12] ~ Mo: Even for projects in Claude, I always have to remind it what we working on, share docs u already shared, give context I already gave… how u workaround this ?
[13.01.26, 12:01:41] ~ Powa: Yea, we’re seeing same thing on our account but doesn’t affect cpa at all
[13.01.26, 12:08:24] ~ Sean: when writing out important prompts to it, tell it to go over everything that was talked over in the project, all documents and all important conversations. he reviews everything, and than starts answering your question
