[10.10.23, 11:35:12] ~ Ciel: Been focusing mostly on TikTok, just starting my FB ads back up since long time. Using an agency account but tracking is shit. It's also having issues tracking purchases in different currencies (eg. 50 euros purchase tracked as 0.05 USD). Any ideas? Does anyone use wetracked? What would be some solutions?
[10.10.23, 11:47:31] Topi: ‎This message was deleted.
[10.10.23, 11:48:21] Topi: Yes wetracked is good and accurate for me and their support is super good if any issues
[10.10.23, 11:55:19] ~ Ciel: Triple whale vs wetracked?
[10.10.23, 11:56:14] Carlos Leeseman: Wetracked works perfectly for me 🙌
[10.10.23, 12:04:46] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: ‎This message was deleted.
[10.10.23, 12:24:09] ~ L: Hi guys, has anyone noticed an increase in CPMs in France in the last 2 weeks?

Is it the q4 effect or is something strange happening with my BMs?
[10.10.23, 12:24:35] ~ Tim Alleraun: What dashboard do you use with wetracked? Face ads dashboard oder the one from wetracked? I tried it for about a week now but honestly so far tracking is not that accurate
[10.10.23, 12:27:07] ~ David B: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[10.10.23, 12:38:02] ~ David B: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.

[10.10.23, 14:30:36] Bob: Does anyone have any problems with the Funnelish checkout today? For some reason all my Funnels give me a error with the payment options, so nobody can check out
[10.10.23, 14:31:11] Carlos Leeseman: I think i’ve the same
[10.10.23, 14:31:18] Carlos Leeseman: I’ve a lot failed payments
[10.10.23, 14:33:29] ~ Maxi: Which processor you using ?
[10.10.23, 14:33:30] ~ Maxi: Stripe ?
[10.10.23, 14:33:56] Bob: Yeah it’s weird, you just use Stripe right?
[10.10.23, 14:34:02] Bob: I use Stripe and Klarna merchant
[10.10.23, 14:35:43] ~ Robin: For me it works as usual today
[10.10.23, 14:39:39] Carlos Leeseman: Yep only stripe
[10.10.23, 14:51:54] Bob: Okay it’s very weird, because I don’t have any failed payments, it just shows as an error on the checkout, so they can’t even try to pay
[10.10.23, 15:57:08] ~ Mohammed-amine: ‎~ Mohammed-amine joined using a group link.
[10.10.23, 15:31:34] ~ Luka: Is Skool.com having issues or something? All videos say "Sorry, this video does not exist"

[10.10.23, 15:34:34] ~ Ciel: Yup same
[10.10.23, 15:47:04] ~ Sang: guys, TikTok shop just launched in USA last month, don't miss the chance, many my friends doing few k orders a day just using TikTok shop only
[10.10.23, 16:26:41] ~ lengjoo: felt like it kinda affect our tiktok ads performance
[10.10.23, 16:26:46] ~ lengjoo: @⁨~Sang⁩ what's their playbook?
[10.10.23, 16:26:59] ~ lengjoo: running ads to tiktok shop or just running organic videos, finding creators to promote your product?
[10.10.23, 16:31:53] ~ Luka: Interesting to see where TikTok goes with this, and how sustainable it is. They're giving benefits, and on top of that.. through specific channels they're giving cashback on ad spend it seems
[10.10.23, 16:36:57] Alex  Fedotoff: Yo brand builders skool platform should be functional now. Please check and confirm
[10.10.23, 16:42:16] ~ Luka: It works now, thanks Alex
[10.10.23, 16:59:23] ~ David B: Copy call goes live now. We're talking about branding. See you there.
[10.10.23, 20:37:14] ~ RS: ‎~ RS joined using a group link.
[10.10.23, 21:21:03] ~ Kyle Twohill: What is a good target hold rate and thumb stop rate
[10.10.23, 21:21:07] ~ Kyle Twohill: For fb
[10.10.23, 21:26:28] ~ Malik: thumb stop ratio should be above 35%
[10.10.23, 21:58:20] ~ Tim Alleraun: In Germany we aim for ~50%
[10.10.23, 23:25:25] ~ Anvar: Depends on the content of the ad

If you show the product in the hook and pitch it right away, you can shoot for 25-30%. Hold rate would be about 15ish 

If it’s a long form VSL where the first minute doesn’t reveal shit - you can get your hooks to 50-60%. Here you can shoot for a hold rate of 25%+
[11.10.23, 1:45:57] ~ Kyle Twohill: Thanks!
[11.10.23, 7:19:58] René Crooijmans: Does somebody have a good contact for a laywer specialized in business law or international law?
[11.10.23, 16:09:30] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨René Crooijmans⁩ please elaborate on specific things you need solving and I’ll share some contacts
[11.10.23, 16:09:43] Alex  Fedotoff: There is just so many aspects to law
[11.10.23, 16:24:32] ~ Daniel Lai: ‎~ Daniel Lai joined using a group link.
[11.10.23, 16:21:41] René Crooijmans: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ thanks Alex ✔️

I need a lawyer who can help me revise the current agreement I have with my Chinese supplier.

We currently already have an agreement, but I need to make sure it’s legally compliant for international law.
[11.10.23, 16:48:42] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨René Crooijmans⁩ these guys are very solid, we use them : dwright@grsm.com

Bit pricy though
[11.10.23, 19:13:30] ~ Bryan T: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[11.10.23, 19:51:57] Yaniv: Is it worth selling a brand with the ad account? or you typically don’t give the fb ad account away with it? Since it’s attached to the main BM.
[11.10.23, 19:52:51] ~ Adonis A: From my experience most buyers prefer having the ad account associated with the brand as well @⁨Yaniv⁩
[11.10.23, 19:53:03] ~ Adonis A: Are you in the process of exiting?
[11.10.23, 19:53:51] Yaniv: Yes they said ad account is mandatory for them. The thing is it’s attached to my main BM’s of my personal ad account. This can put me in high risk
[12.10.23, 14:48:56] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, really sorry we will need to cancel laters call at 9am EST about content sourcing & tiktok. Super sick today. Gladly shoot me a DM if you have any specific question. Talk soon
[12.10.23, 15:28:14] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Something to recommend to a good developer
To improve shopify store speed and fix theme bug?
[12.10.23, 18:28:04] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Golden nuggets! Alex made it pretty clear what could be done on landing pages side

One more thing we can do from marketing side is more touch points! Basically strong retargetting to make customers feel comfortable / frequency

Like retargetting 30days visitors with an edited video including a few faces/ testimonials 

Like I bought this product 1 month ago, this is how it helped me, this is difference, my husband/wife loves this for xyz reason, and make sure to show your brand packaging in videos so no one can steal it
[12.10.23, 18:56:48] ~ lengjoo: yo guys anyone running heavy on tiktok shop now and successful with tiktok shop affiliate creators? wanna connect 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12.10.23, 19:15:20] ~ Nim: +1 to this. Looking to get tiktok shop cooking asap also.

[12.10.23, 19:47:08] ~ lengjoo: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ any big tips 😆
[12.10.23, 21:24:43] ~ Alex Noghreh: Any agency recommendations for TikTok ?  Have my hands full with so many things and it’s something I can’t stack on my plate.
[12.10.23, 21:26:24] ~ Kyle Twohill: Do any of you use a email capture pop up on funnelish?
[12.10.23, 21:26:51] ~ Kyle Twohill: I don’t have one now on my main funnel and get a very low % of e-mail revenue compared to shopify
[12.10.23, 21:26:56] ~ Kyle Twohill: Or does it tank conv rate
[12.10.23, 21:31:53] ~ Matt: We run FB and TT ads for brands across industries like CPG, apparel, accessories, and more. Happy to chat if you’d like. I made Tiktok training videos for the group for Alex  a few weeks ago🤘 ‎<This message was edited>
[12.10.23, 22:00:03] Alex  Fedotoff: Yeah we will prepare sone top training for you
[12.10.23, 22:08:39] ~ Bryan T: How do you develop a great BFCM sales promo strategy? Really trying to optimize ours as it's a bit all over the place.
[12.10.23, 22:08:50] ~ ‎Carl Weische: what product?
[12.10.23, 22:09:03] ~ Bryan T: We're in apparel
[12.10.23, 22:09:08] ~ ‎Carl Weische: lead gen with fomo campaigns and special sale on password protected page works amazing
[12.10.23, 22:09:13] ~ ‎Carl Weische: espcially apparel
[12.10.23, 22:14:03] ~ Bryan T: Sounds like a great idea, I'll have to look into this strat thanks
[12.10.23, 23:57:05] ~ Alex Noghreh: Does the training cover TikTok Shop ?  I assume not since Alex mentioned new training in works for that .

[13.10.23, 1:38:37] ~ Kevin kreative: You guys can take the Slides as training videos are in Vietnamesw
[13.10.23, 12:56:03] ~ Kevin kreative: Is anyone here using Gorgias? I'm finding CS suite for chat, email tickets, and phone. Need to ask for advices
[13.10.23, 15:45:26] ~ lengjoo: can 1 business have 2 stripe accounts? 1 as backup?
[13.10.23, 15:45:28] ~ lengjoo: or is that not allowed
[13.10.23, 15:49:54] ~ Kevin kreative: you can create that sub-account within Stripe
[13.10.23, 15:50:23] ~ Kevin kreative: but should register different domain (for safe). We use to register 2 accounts on 1 domain without any harm
[13.10.23, 15:51:41] ~ Kevin kreative: if you register 1 domain, Stripe will see it as relate at brand/domain level. However, when you register 1 LLC/LTD with 2 domains which stand for 2 brands, Stripe will treat differently
[13.10.23, 15:52:02] ~ Kevin kreative: anw, CS & FF still are core to keep processors alive
‎[13.10.23, 16:49:16] Matán Intsuper: ‎image omitted
[13.10.23, 19:21:03] ~ Bryan T: Try a non-amex card, we had this issue with specific cards for some reason
[13.10.23, 19:30:27] Matán Intsuper: It’s the Visa card actually that giving the problem
[13.10.23, 20:42:16] ~ Bryan T: Anyone have a good e-book author?
[13.10.23, 22:17:34] ~ Alex: Have you tried using AI? Pretty solid once you get the prompts down. Can send you our method if you want to try it out
[13.10.23, 22:53:12] ~ Bryan T: Yeah this would be awesome, would love to give it a shot thanks
[14.10.23, 8:08:12] ~ Luka: We have 3 and no issues.

1 + 1 sub account (2 total)

and another one in another country for another brand, under my name.

Despite having 2 seperate accounts in different regions, we never experienced any issues whatsoever
[14.10.23, 8:36:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Did anyone test instead of using a seperate checkout landing page on funnelish to just let them select the product on the sales page and also fill in their info there? Like the 3 boxes for example on the bottom of the page, i am not sure how to do that
[14.10.23, 8:38:13] ~ Y: Use same email for both and notify them before, they did ban an account before for having two under different emails…. Just don’t do anything suspicious… ie. Trying to hide identity or business, having multiple accounts otherwise is normal eg. Each account for different brand under same legal entity
[14.10.23, 8:40:22] ~ Kevin kreative: Hi, can you check our message in group with my team
[14.10.23, 8:40:32] ~ Kevin kreative: @⁨~Y⁩
[14.10.23, 11:19:05] ~ Matteo S.R: Interested also !
[14.10.23, 14:48:43] ~ Harvey: @⁨~Y⁩ Can you please respond to our message
[15.10.23, 3:55:33] ~ Kevin kreative: Can anyone reach out to Funnelish guys?
[15.10.23, 12:48:01] ~ Y: I saw your message i just need time to get to it! I have too many than i can handle on whatsapp
[15.10.23, 16:17:16] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hello guys,
Do you have a copywriter on your team?
What are their specifications?


I've hired a good copywriter on my team and trained him.

He's currently helping me with VLS scripting, advertorial and marketing analysis.

What other tasks could I entrust to him?

Any advice or feedback would be most welcome.
[15.10.23, 16:21:35] ~ Maxi: What about the results he is producing ? Is he good ?

Maybe before putting on more tasks, ensuring that the quality of his copy will be better and better by investing in some coaching for him.

Besides that, maybe let him work on product pages on the "above the fold" sections since there the copy is also important, increasing upsells take-rate via VSLs or long-copy
[15.10.23, 16:26:48] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: He is good, 
I coach him and give him training and he learned a lot

Okay thanks you for other advices
[15.10.23, 16:27:55] ~ Santi Roa: That advise was wonderful. I hope I heard that before.

If you focus on "this person has free time, what else can he do?", you will end with a load of busywork that ends waterfalling to your entire team
[15.10.23, 16:28:31] ~ Santi Roa: And that never ends. Better if you focus on the quality and independency of this person, and then add more tasks
[15.10.23, 16:32:20] ~ Maxi: Where did you find him ?
[15.10.23, 22:01:21] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: 100% agree
[15.10.23, 22:01:32] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: On upwork
[15.10.23, 22:07:05] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Any Google Optimize alternative?
Convert look great but expensive
[16.10.23, 8:15:58] ~ Natasha Iris: Here’s a good list of alternatives for Google optimize and Convert (due to price) 

1. Optimizely: A comprehensive experimentation platform for A/B testing and personalization.

2. VWO (Visual Website Optimizer): Offers A/B testing, heatmaps, and session recordings for website optimization.

3. AB Tasty: Provides A/B testing, split testing, and multivariate testing capabilities along with advanced targeting options.

4. Adobe Target: Part of the Adobe Experience Cloud suite, it offers advanced testing and personalization features.

5. Crazy Egg: Focuses on visual analytics with heatmaps, scroll maps, and click tracking.

From what I’ve heard people prefer AB tasty the best. But of course it depends on your needs & requirements. 🙏🏼
[16.10.23, 10:47:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anybody using afterlib as a spytool? Is it better then for example adspy? And why?
[16.10.23, 10:48:25] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I use afterlib, I like it more than adspy and such. Its easy to use and ive found loads of products
[16.10.23, 10:49:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ok great, i tried minea as well but i had a hard time finding advertorials/vsls on there
[16.10.23, 10:49:28] ~ Luka: With Afterlib I found it has a lot more creatives & products than other spy tools which is something that really stood out. They got a $1 trial you can try
[16.10.23, 10:49:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: now joining all kinds of affiliate networks and wanted to try a new tool
[16.10.23, 10:49:55] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Cool, i see that, ill try that out
[16.10.23, 10:50:06] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: On afterlib you can filter for funnelish and stuff like that, so very easy to find vsl's and funnels
[16.10.23, 10:50:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: great
[16.10.23, 10:51:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: funnelish filter does make it a lot easier
[16.10.23, 10:51:34] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Yes
[16.10.23, 11:50:59] ~ Luka: To those who transcribe VSLs & ads... if you just upload the video on Slack, Slack will instantly show you the transcript for the whole video... free
[16.10.23, 13:39:41] ~ Santi Roa: VWO sucks now, they use to be one of the best, but now it's not that good. 
I'd suggest to invest the money for convert, if you do it right you make it back in the first days of a successful experiment
[16.10.23, 13:47:30] ~ Allan L: Anyone knows a laywer with experience in dealing with suppliers not holding up their end?
Seems servicepoints.nl scammed me, their agents keep saying the orders will be shipped. But after 25 days, nothing has left the warehouse yet in more than 180 cases.

They keep stalling and I think its about time for me to take legal actions. Anyone knows a good contact for a lawyer?
[16.10.23, 14:09:13] ~ RS: Hey! Is Shopify one page checkout working good for you? I saw a huge drop in conversion rates since I enabled one page checkout. And in Twitter there are hundreds of people complaining about huge conversion rate drops since they enabled OPC. Problems with payments etc.
[16.10.23, 14:12:28] ~ Alex: Very slight increase for us. Everyone else I spoke got a drop
[16.10.23, 14:17:01] ~ Santi Roa: We got a drop so we switched back to 3 step checkout
[16.10.23, 14:17:24] ~ Viktor Metodiev: +1 No reason to use anything other than Convert really.
[16.10.23, 14:36:27] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you very much @⁨~Natasha Iris⁩
[16.10.23, 14:37:21] ~ Allan L: How did you do that? I dont see that option anymore
[16.10.23, 14:50:46] ~ RS: You can switch back if you have shopify plus. If not, contact support and ask them to switch back to 3page. I asked it today. Hope they will switch back soon, because one page checkout is a total disaster in my opinion. Hundreds of people are complaining
[16.10.23, 15:13:26] ~ Santi Roa: I thought it was for everyone but it's only to plus users. Anyways you should consider plus. If you do more than 700k/month it's basically free for what you save on the transaction fees
[16.10.23, 15:24:34] ~ G M: How much does it cost monthly Shopify plus?
[16.10.23, 15:26:38] ~ Alex: 2k
[16.10.23, 16:19:49] ~ Alvaro: ‎Lucia Van added ~ Alvaro
[16.10.23, 17:32:49] ~ Kevin Krieg: Same
[16.10.23, 17:37:21] René Crooijmans: Does someone know a good EU based private label supplement supplier? 

Like an EU alternative to Suppliful
[16.10.23, 18:36:52] ~ Rajat Grover: ‎~ Rajat Grover joined using a group link.
[17.10.23, 2:18:17] ~ Natasha Iris: I DM’d you
[17.10.23, 2:18:47] ~ Natasha Iris: Of course! Hope that helps
[17.10.23, 17:16:01] Matán Intsuper: Hey guys, my fb ads account was disabled due to unusual activity and they’re refusing to reactivate it now. Anyone can help with an insider? The disabling is not due to violating any terms it’s just due to a change in payment method. ‎<This message was edited>
[17.10.23, 17:17:11] Bob: Have you tried reaching out several times? I had a similar issue before, contacted them like 5 times and the fifth person helped me, some just know more then others there
[17.10.23, 18:05:12] Matán Intsuper: I mean I tried like 3 times. What should I write though?
[17.10.23, 18:39:00] ~ lengjoo: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[17.10.23, 18:46:52] Matán Intsuper: What are your challenges?
[17.10.23, 18:47:15] Matán Intsuper: I just have them send invoices and then pay them (or have someone else paid them). In the past we connected them to click up and it created a task
[17.10.23, 18:47:36] Topi: We do this same 100%
[17.10.23, 18:47:41] ~ lengjoo: i set up automatic recurring payments using mercury, we have like 10 employees. Bank fees and stuff
[17.10.23, 18:48:01] Matán Intsuper: Mercury has no bank fees
[17.10.23, 18:48:08] ~ lengjoo: you guys cover fees?
[17.10.23, 18:48:29] Matán Intsuper: I don’t cover fees
[17.10.23, 18:48:46] Matán Intsuper: Unless it’s part of the agreement with the freelancer but 90% no
[17.10.23, 18:49:07] Matán Intsuper: Nobody has ever complained
[17.10.23, 18:49:14] ~ lengjoo: might just pay the 15$ to cover fees lol because they are saying on their end, they got $15 less
[17.10.23, 18:49:21] ~ lengjoo: some 20
[17.10.23, 18:49:30] Matán Intsuper: Compare to wise
[17.10.23, 18:49:31] ~ lengjoo: and we pay biweekly (every 2 weeks)
[17.10.23, 18:49:38] Matán Intsuper: I prefer to pay with wise and they receive the exact amount
[17.10.23, 18:49:42] Matán Intsuper: After fees
[17.10.23, 18:50:09] ~ lengjoo: do you do biweekly or once a month?
[17.10.23, 18:50:18] Matán Intsuper: Both
[17.10.23, 18:50:21] Matán Intsuper: Depends on the employee
[17.10.23, 18:50:44] Matán Intsuper: In some countries people prefer monthly
[17.10.23, 18:50:44] ~ lengjoo: because biweekly means we’re paying more in a year 😂
[17.10.23, 18:50:53] Matán Intsuper: Not necessarily
[17.10.23, 18:51:00] Matán Intsuper: In terms of fees
[17.10.23, 18:51:09] Matán Intsuper: But more payments yes
[17.10.23, 18:51:29] Matán Intsuper: Try wise. I’m not sure how much you’re paying but maybe the fees will be lower on wise
[17.10.23, 18:52:14] ~ lengjoo: just gonna pay mercury $15 to cover fees lol but that like additional $30 per month per employee just on covering fees
[17.10.23, 18:52:29] Matán Intsuper: I’m not sure it’s necessary
[17.10.23, 18:53:00] Matán Intsuper: It depends on the currency, location of employee, bank accounts etc
[17.10.23, 18:53:19] ~ lengjoo: mostly PH people
[17.10.23, 18:53:39] ~ lengjoo: international wire
[17.10.23, 18:53:40] Matán Intsuper: Got it. Ph I pay with wise and they receive php in a good rate and they don’t complain
[17.10.23, 18:53:45] Matán Intsuper: And I don’t cover the fees
[17.10.23, 18:53:59] ~ lengjoo: ahh so you just transfer to PHP for them
[17.10.23, 18:54:11] Matán Intsuper: Yep
[17.10.23, 18:54:25] Matán Intsuper: And they know exactly how much they receive and they get tracking updates
[17.10.23, 18:54:29] ~ lengjoo: can you set up automatic recurring payments on wise? like every 2 weeks etc
[17.10.23, 18:54:36] Matán Intsuper: Yes
[17.10.23, 18:54:44] ~ lengjoo: ok
[17.10.23, 18:54:46] ~ lengjoo: thanks

[18.10.23, 1:55:22] Alex  Fedotoff: Mohammed welcome back my man!!!!
[18.10.23, 2:06:57] ~ Mohammed-amine: Thanks @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ !
[18.10.23, 2:47:42] ~ Natasha Iris: Welcome back!
[18.10.23, 5:47:37] ~ Kyle Twohill: Quick question about testing video hook variations. Let’s say you have one video and want to test 3 hooks. Do you keep the audio/voice the same and try different 3 second clips, then take that winner and try different audio clips? Or do you just do a different audio and video clip at the same time and take that winner? ‎<This message was edited>
[18.10.23, 9:55:17] ~ Sang: just make as many variations as u could , then put them all into 1 adset
[18.10.23, 9:55:40] ~ Sang: 3 hooks x 3 musics x 3 voices x 3 body scenes = 81 videos
[18.10.23, 9:58:35] ~ Sang: or 20 videos / adset, depends on your budget
[18.10.23, 14:22:57] ~ Santi Roa: Woah I do it VERY differently
[18.10.23, 14:23:37] ~ Santi Roa: We put 1 creative per adset, and spend 100/day per adset no touch for 4 days, and usually no touch for 7 days (we kill it the 4th if it's Super bad)
[18.10.23, 14:25:00] ~ Santi Roa: And those are just different variations. Each thing you can change to the video might affect results.

We make net new concepts every week +
variations of winners

For these variations of winners, we start with the highest leverage, and look for winner variations that perform better or equal than the original. This help us scale the account
[18.10.23, 14:25:20] ~ Santi Roa: And slowly we test lower leverage variations such as music, text style, etc
[18.10.23, 14:28:35] ~ Maxi: You put 81 creatives into 1x adset ?
[18.10.23, 14:29:38] ~ lengjoo: in between you guys, we do 1 ad x 3 hooks x 2 pages (6 variations per adset) 😂
[18.10.23, 14:31:34] Carlos Leeseman: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[18.10.23, 14:31:36] ~ Malik: same
[18.10.23, 14:31:54] ~ lengjoo: scroll stoppers are thumbnails?
[18.10.23, 14:32:05] ~ Malik: How are the results overall for you guys atm ? It's very unstable for me like it can be very good to very bad each day
[18.10.23, 14:32:13] Carlos Leeseman: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[18.10.23, 14:33:20] ~ RS: The same. Profit margin dropped by 50% since I switched to shopify one page checkout. Huge drop from initiate checkout to purchase every day. Some days roas is good, some days in losses.
[18.10.23, 14:46:26] ~ Mohammed-amine: Depends on how fast you want to move and how much budget you're willing to spend. We usually test all at the same time.
[18.10.23, 14:46:53] ~ lengjoo: what is your starting budget with this much variations?
[18.10.23, 14:48:16] ~ Mohammed-amine: Are the pages related to the ad angle or completely different? thinking about testing pages that matches the ad angle
[18.10.23, 16:01:45] ~ David Hu: DCT? Or regular stacked ads in the adset?
[18.10.23, 16:50:58] ~ lengjoo: no link, we just split testing pages 😂 sometimes it does better on branded page, sometimes it does better on 3rd party pages
[18.10.23, 16:51:17] ~ lengjoo: regular stacked ads
[18.10.23, 17:14:54] Carlos Leeseman: Does anyone know how to disable an automatic rule on 1 specific adset?
[18.10.23, 17:15:13] Matán Intsuper: edit the rule
[18.10.23, 18:08:16] ~ Kyle Twohill: Thanks for the tips everyone !
[18.10.23, 18:13:25] ~ Sang: in my case, 50 is max . It is depend on your budget and the confidence of your product. In early phase , goal = find winning video with lowest budget => combine ads => let facebook choose the best one => no waste money. In phase 2/ 3 scaling phase => Goal is find winning ads fast => isolated ads ‎<This message was edited>
[18.10.23, 18:13:37] ~ Sang: so combine or isolate ads, it depends on your goal
[18.10.23, 18:14:27] ~ David: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[18.10.23, 19:08:50] ~ Luka: How often do you guys run into quality control issues with your manufacturers? Our manufacturer produces a really good product (very high satisfaction from customers) but it seems every month there's some new issue although for a very small %... but that small amount are fires our CS team has to turn off and make sure they don't leave negative reviews (ex. amazon)
‎[18.10.23, 19:44:45] ~ Michael Abovyan: ‎image omitted
[18.10.23, 19:49:02] ~ Rajat Grover: which software do you use for accounting?
[18.10.23, 19:49:24] ~ Michael Abovyan: Triple whale and google sheets lmao
[18.10.23, 19:50:02] ~ Rajat Grover: Thanks for sharing!
[18.10.23, 19:51:40] ~ Mike Ramsey: You may have to charge tax in the US if you hit or exceed economic nexus. Economic nexus means that a state can require a business to collect and remit sales tax even if the business does not have a physical presence in the state.
[18.10.23, 19:52:43] ~ Mike Ramsey: Have you had a discussion with your tax advisor on this?
[18.10.23, 19:52:57] ~ Michael Abovyan: So if I collect the tax, would I have to pay it to the US during tax time? Even though I don’t have a citizenship or business there
[18.10.23, 19:53:18] ~ Michael Abovyan: No, don’t have one
[18.10.23, 19:54:44] ~ Mike Ramsey: DM’ing you
[18.10.23, 20:17:30] ~ Amelia Nguyen: How much do you guys pay for a VA?
[18.10.23, 22:31:33] ~ Santi Roa: Yes
[18.10.23, 22:32:18] ~ Santi Roa: Sales tax is based on where you sell the goods, not where you live or where your biz is incorporated.

Obviously, some people go grey and avoid paying these for some time, which is hard to find when you are not in the country
[18.10.23, 22:32:56] ~ Santi Roa: But the answer is yes, you have to pay it. Register in each state you have to pay and submit the sales tax report monthly/bimonthly or quarterly depending on the state
[18.10.23, 22:33:02] ~ Santi Roa: And pay it back
[18.10.23, 22:33:28] ~ Santi Roa: The only change to your customers is that they will pay taxes on top of the order at checkout and you have to keep that money and pay it back to the state
[18.10.23, 22:36:35] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Hi @⁨~Santi Roa⁩ so basically I have to set tax for 52 states here in US?
[18.10.23, 22:37:54] ~ Santi Roa: Nono just in the ones you crossed the threshold
[18.10.23, 22:38:04] ~ Santi Roa: Anyways, consult with a CPA or a specialist in the matter
[18.10.23, 22:38:30] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Oh ok got it! Thanks Santi
[18.10.23, 22:38:53] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Do you have any CPA that is knowledgable with eCommerce that you can recommend? ‎<This message was edited>
[18.10.23, 22:52:42] ~ Adonis A: Clean financials/bookkeeping are probably the biggest issue we see when buying a brand or helping a seller exit. @⁨~Amelia Nguyen⁩ i can recommend the cpa that we use if you need one. Just Dm me
[18.10.23, 23:55:07] ~ Matt: I can give reference to an ecom cfo and bookkeeper if needed as well

Join in if you like
[19.10.23, 16:09:10] ~ Haroon: how do you guys fix the issue with duplicating post id without going the complex route through page Posts searching? because through the link it is not working, any efficient way?
[19.10.23, 16:42:03] ~ Mohammed-amine: Simply duplicate and keep "share existing reactions, comments etc" checked
[19.10.23, 16:42:41] ~ Haroon: is that working for you 100%
[19.10.23, 16:42:44] ~ Haroon: @⁨~Mohammed-amine⁩
[19.10.23, 16:42:50] ~ Mohammed-amine: Yes
[19.10.23, 16:42:52] ~ Daniel Lai: turn your ads into post IDS
[19.10.23, 16:43:02] Bob: If you go into the ad itself you can choose use existing post ID, when you do that it will show you the ad Id. Then you just discard the draft and post it into a new ad
[19.10.23, 16:43:05] Bob: That’s what I do
[19.10.23, 16:57:47] ~ lengjoo: We're processing $1.2M through Stripe, how low can we negotiate the fees down to?

Best possible way to do this? 🙏
[19.10.23, 18:04:14] ~ Mohammed-amine: Sent you a DM
[19.10.23, 18:04:23] ~ David Hu: Sorry if this has been asked before, but does anyone know where I can find high, visual animations for health/wellness products? eg. blood flow, collagen, cell growth, etc. Storyblocks doesn't have enough of what I'm looking for
[19.10.23, 18:07:25] ~ David B: Canva pro has stock video you can loop.

[19.10.23, 23:56:22] ~ Allan L: Anyone experiencing cr to be random? For The last month its Been jumping up and Down from 6-0.5% cr. I Can almost predict The cr now from The morning. But obviously something seems wrong. Fb traffic.
[20.10.23, 1:02:29] ~ Malik: same here
[20.10.23, 1:02:59] ~ RS: Yep. Since shopify forced to use one page checkout
[20.10.23, 1:03:52] ~ David Hu: Yeah seeing the same thing. CR has dropped so much for this month. Some days are back to normal >4% and then there's days where I can't break 3%
[20.10.23, 1:15:11] ~ Mohammed-amine: For CRO split tests on Funnelish, how much time or how many unique sessions do you leave them running for before making a decision? ‎<This message was edited>
[20.10.23, 1:21:30] ~ Allan L: @⁨~RS⁩ @⁨~Malik⁩ @⁨~David Hu⁩ 
Yesterday i had 6% cr, today 0.7%. 
Before all this i did 1500 sales with 3.7% cr kinda steady. But shifting from 4-6% to 0.5-1%. 
Is that what you see as well?
[20.10.23, 1:22:36] ~ RS: CR is different almost every day. One day 3% (roas over 3 and 35%+ profit), next day roas 1% and losses
[20.10.23, 1:23:11] ~ RS: It started in 20th of september when I switched to one oage checkout. Since then I have huge drops from initiate checkout to purchase
[20.10.23, 1:23:58] ~ Allan L: Yea thats The same here. Its crazy. Impossible to run atm. 
Mine started since 15th september. 
IC is always The same, its just The CR that screws up for me
[20.10.23, 1:24:11] ~ David Hu: Mine is not as volatile as yours, just consistent low CVR. lowest CVR all year this month
[20.10.23, 1:24:29] ~ Allan L: Guess its time to try out funnelish.
[20.10.23, 1:24:58] ~ Daniel Lai: I think Facebook is messing with their algorithm a lot now, with all these changes to detailed targeting etc.

+ it’s early Q4 and CPMs and overall spends about to go up, so they probably testing a bunch of stuff
[20.10.23, 1:25:06] ~ Allan L: Hmm okay. But Yea, impossible to do workarounds as some days its like i am just getting bot traffic
[20.10.23, 1:26:00] ~ Allan L: Nothing Else changed. Only The CR for me. 
IC, CPM, CTR is is The same sadly
[20.10.23, 1:26:29] ~ David Hu: Same here
[20.10.23, 1:28:07] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Same for me, guys! The cr went from 2.5% to 1.5%🥲 it comes and goes
[20.10.23, 1:30:17] ~ RS: Tried. CR is even Lower with funnelish. The only thing you can Get is higher Aov. But in my case, I have bigger Aov in shopify than in funnelish for one of my stores, so shopify always perform better. But for my cosmetics store funnelish have 40% higher Aov than shopify+gempages, so its worth. Depends on your product
[20.10.23, 1:41:31] ~ Bryan T: Anyone here have any experience with insense? Seems pretty expensive
[20.10.23, 1:41:58] ~ Bryan T: What do you think the best UGC platform to use is?
[20.10.23, 1:45:51] Yaniv: your higher AOV from upsells will results in higher chargeback rates.
[20.10.23, 1:46:13] ~ RS: Thats right
[20.10.23, 1:46:14] Yaniv: no free lunch
[20.10.23, 5:55:36] ~ Mohammed-amine: Hi guys, for those of you using advertorials, do they get fatigued same way as creatives?
[20.10.23, 6:49:07] ~ Sang: i find a good structure for retargeting , put all audience ( visit 180d, page engage 180d)  exclude pur into 1 adset ( all creative into this adset ) Then let facebook optimize
[20.10.23, 6:49:16] ~ Sang: 4-5x ROAS
[20.10.23, 6:51:53] ~ lengjoo: do you combine image and video ads in the same adset?
[20.10.23, 6:52:18] ~ Sang: yes , all winning creative
[20.10.23, 6:52:30] ~ lengjoo: what are your other standard campaigns roas at?
[20.10.23, 6:52:31] ~ Sang: 1-2 testimonial / review / promotion
[20.10.23, 6:52:41] ~ lengjoo: ahh i see
[20.10.23, 6:52:49] ~ lengjoo: any cap on how many creative can be in an adset?
[20.10.23, 6:52:56] ~ lengjoo: max 10/20?
[20.10.23, 6:53:10] ~ Sang: i put 50 creatives lol
[20.10.23, 6:54:01] ~ lengjoo: lol nicee
[20.10.23, 6:54:39] ~ Sang: my MER is low, around 1.7-1.8

[20.10.23, 10:01:20] ~ Rajat Grover: Yes, dm me
[20.10.23, 10:01:41] ~ Rajat Grover: I have my own in-house team for developers
[20.10.23, 10:05:22] ~ lengjoo: for selling products online? weird
[20.10.23, 10:05:34] ~ lengjoo: if it's an important page with a lot of spend behind it can consider unbanning it
[20.10.23, 10:06:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: When making the page you select where you use it for right
[20.10.23, 10:06:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: maybe something went wrong there, that you selected the wrong thing
[20.10.23, 10:09:29] Carlos Leeseman: Yeah or if you’re a community page and then sell online with it
[20.10.23, 10:11:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Right this is what I mean
[20.10.23, 10:17:14] Carlos Leeseman: What app do you guys use for track & trace on webshop? I now use Trackr, but not sure if this is the best one
[20.10.23, 10:23:25] René Crooijmans: Right now ParcelPanel but will most likely be switching to Rush soon
[20.10.23, 10:23:42] René Crooijmans: More customization in terms of design & shipping noti’s
[20.10.23, 10:25:34] ~ Malik: ParcelPanel too
[20.10.23, 10:45:17] ~ Ciel: Anyone know how to fix Shopify under-reporting number of conversions? Talking about within the Shopify dashboard
‎[20.10.23, 13:45:29] ~ Alexander: ‎image omitted
[20.10.23, 14:21:05] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I do exactly the same and work great
[20.10.23, 14:25:54] ~ Daniel Lai: does changing it in the app settings not work?
[20.10.23, 17:45:03] ~ Ciel: Hey guys have a question!

I recently got intro'd to use an agency account and the restriction is that I can only run from the domain which they have verified and approved. 

So that means I wouldn't be able to run up new stores with new domains to test rapidly. 

So I want to ask, how are high level dropshippers testing many products? 

Should I try to acquire a BM and ad account that I own myself so I can do this? 

For context, my personal advertising profile has been banned for a while

Or what would be the solution here?
[20.10.23, 17:47:19] ~ Luka: Not sure if this is the best method today but what we did in the past was buy laptops from amazon, send it to people and pay them $100/mo.

They download TeamViewer, log onto FB and after 1-2 weeks of "real" activity (basically we logged in daily, scrolled, clicked links etc), then  we run ads using their account.

No shady stuff, they were aware we'll run ads, we'll need their ID to verify, and all that.
[20.10.23, 17:53:27] ~ Alvaro: Hey! Do you guys know of any platform to buy Hong Kong phone numbers?
[20.10.23, 17:54:23] René Crooijmans: You can forward the DNS and nameservers of the domain linked to the agency acc to cloudflare, then set up SSLs in cloudflare and pagerules to forward to other domains and /domains
[20.10.23, 17:54:37] René Crooijmans: Would only be a hassle with changes page names etc
[20.10.23, 17:55:04] René Crooijmans: Richie recommended me to pick a branded name that doesnt limit you in the niche you want to be in and just use that for all product tests
[20.10.23, 17:55:17] René Crooijmans: I had to do this because we changed brand names

[20.10.23, 21:44:55] Carlos Leeseman: Pm me!
[21.10.23, 10:28:03] ~ Mikael: have anyone tested both Wetracked and Hyros then compared them? Which one is best?

We are using hyros right now and we´ve been using it for 1+ year
[21.10.23, 10:36:12] ~ lengjoo: and how is the tracking with funnelish?
[21.10.23, 10:36:41] ~ Mikael: for Hyros its works.
[21.10.23, 10:44:35] ~ lengjoo: apart from tracking what are you using hyros for?
[21.10.23, 10:44:54] ~ lengjoo: wetracked is purely for tracking at this point
[21.10.23, 10:44:58] ~ Mikael: Sending data back to meta, using the hyros pixel etc.
[21.10.23, 10:45:19] ~ Mikael: Wetracked told me that they send back data to meta pixel and do it better than hyros and hyros is lying..
[21.10.23, 10:46:00] ~ lengjoo: pretty accurate same with sending data back to meta, can prob ask the founders more on what they do exactly @⁨~E.⁩
[21.10.23, 10:46:01] Carlos Leeseman: Yep try, I’m also using wetracked and my pixel is tracking perfectly
[21.10.23, 10:46:12] ~ lengjoo: oh i thought they do send data back ‎<This message was edited>
[21.10.23, 10:47:08] ~ lengjoo: are you using much of hyros dashboard?
[21.10.23, 10:48:15] ~ Mikael: no not really. IM just using the chrome extension on FB ads to see the correct data.
[21.10.23, 10:49:31] ~ lengjoo: then you’re prob overpaying 😂 how much is hyros
[21.10.23, 10:49:53] ~ Mikael: hmm it depends on if wetracked is as good or better. but yeah hyros is expensive
[21.10.23, 10:50:00] ~ Mikael: paying around 1k per month
[21.10.23, 10:50:02] ~ Luka: ^ Was using Hyros too - personally like it a lot better than Northbeam (new user to northbeam) but Hyros is pricey for a simple functionality
[21.10.23, 11:11:01] ~ E.: I'd be happy to tell you more about it. If you have any specific questions, you can always reach out to me or one of my colleagues.

If you have doubts about the quality of our service, I recommend that you listen to the experiences of our users because they speak from their own firsthand experiences. :)
[21.10.23, 13:24:34] ~ Mikael: Sure bro. Im glad to hear more. Im open to switch if its better.
[21.10.23, 13:51:05] ~ E.: Sure, I'll simplify that for you. Hyros uses a Chrome extension that adds a layer to your ads manager. This layer displays the conversions for a specific campaign, which is what they mean by sending the data back to the Ads Manager.

In contrast, we send data back to the ad platform in order to match conversions with a specific profile and attribute the conversion to a campaign the profile previously clicked on. This process doesn't need a Chrome extension. This approach is more effective because it helps the ad platform target the right audience by narrowing down your broad audience, as they will have a better understanding of who your audience actually is.
[21.10.23, 13:54:48] ~ David: Hi team, what documents are you uploading in the fb page revisions?
[21.10.23, 13:54:52] ~ David: They have changed all Interface and it is different now, they are not accepting the documentation we have always sent
[21.10.23, 13:54:54] ~ David: any advice?
[21.10.23, 14:03:08] ~ Mikael: Hyros uses chrome extension to show the correct data. But they also use hyros pixel and data to send back data to the meta pixel. Also i am using hyros pixel which is suppose to work better
[21.10.23, 14:12:16] ~ E.: I understand. If you disable the Chrome extension for a moment and observe what the ad platform records for conversions, you can determine if the data sent directly to the ad platform is accurate. What your ads manager displays without the extension is essentially what the ad platform knows. Without this data, the ad platform would be targeting blindly.
[21.10.23, 16:05:40] ~ Mohammed-amine: If you use funnelish you probably wouldn't need any tracking software. Facebook is quite accurate with Funnelish.
[21.10.23, 16:34:48] René Crooijmans: Would still use tracking software with Funnelish
[21.10.23, 16:37:19] ~ Mark: wetracked can also work with Funnelish
[22.10.23, 11:39:46] ~ Mikael: Yeah i understand what you mean. I asked Hyros About this and they explained this to me. but i dont remember what they told me haha
[22.10.23, 14:03:23] ~ Luka: Anyone here attending AWA? Affiliate World Asia
[22.10.23, 14:13:59] ~ busy: 🙋🏼‍♂️
[22.10.23, 14:29:51] ~ lengjoo: those on funnelish, do you create a geo-funnel for every single country?

is there a better way to do this lol
[22.10.23, 14:32:11] ~ lengjoo: currency converter or smth
[22.10.23, 14:34:04] ~ G M: Me
[22.10.23, 14:35:04] ~ RS: Yep Im doing geo funnels for each country. But targeting top5
[22.10.23, 14:50:50] ~ Rajat Grover: Just need 1 small advice

I need Klarna and Paypal both 


so I just registered an wyoming llc but that this won't let me to have paypal until 3 months as ITIN is required

and klarna - it's a new business, how to get this approved?


shall I open a UK company would that expedite the process to have paypal quick? and Klarna?

basically I want both the gateways  Klarna and paypal as a new business
[22.10.23, 14:51:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: When you have a website ready you should be able to get klarna
[22.10.23, 14:51:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: doesnt matter if you are new
[22.10.23, 14:51:55] ~ Jeremy Leppink: only get more questions the first time
[22.10.23, 14:53:15] ~ Rajat Grover: okay so for start can I use my indian business website? as that's 8 years old website with decent amount of numbers 

and later add the new website?
[22.10.23, 14:53:24] ~ Daniel Lai: I formed a Delaware LLC a few months back and got 2 paypals under that LLC, you just need an EIN, the ITIN / SSN is for identity proof, you can smooth talk the paypal reps and get through those stages
[22.10.23, 14:55:27] ~ Rajat Grover: sure...will try it once I have EIN as EIN would take around 30-35 days

so any other quick solution? like UK company?
[22.10.23, 14:57:06] ~ Daniel Lai: I’d say the wait is more worth, cause paypal currency conversion fees are brutal (can be like an extra 2-3% off your margin)
[22.10.23, 14:57:48] ~ Luka: For those attending AWA we could make a group meet up in Bangkok
[22.10.23, 14:59:28] ~ Rajat Grover: Sure, thanks for the advice
[22.10.23, 15:00:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Better to start it off with the website you actually want it for
[22.10.23, 15:00:29] ~ Jeremy Leppink: doesnt matter if it has 0 sales
[22.10.23, 15:00:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Its more that the website should be functional and has everything it needs
[22.10.23, 15:02:55] ~ Rajat Grover: Sure, will try applying for klarna as soon as I get my Ein
[22.10.23, 17:25:42] Topi: Hey guys, my klaviyo {{ event.extra.checkout_url }} is now taking people only to front page after 1 page checkout. Any fix for this?
[23.10.23, 9:27:43] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: When do you start receiving payouts for a new store? Been 10 days no scheduled payouts.
[23.10.23, 9:28:08] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: With Shopify Payments
[23.10.23, 9:30:26] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You should be able to see when you receive it
[23.10.23, 9:31:01] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Store is only 10 Days old and no payouts yet
[23.10.23, 9:31:21] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: But I have done over $30k
[23.10.23, 9:31:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: when you go to payouts you dont see " Next payout on (date)" ?
[23.10.23, 9:31:48] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Nope nothing there yet
[23.10.23, 9:31:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: and on your home page are also no "we need additional information about ..."
[23.10.23, 9:32:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: because they probably need something then as you shouldve received money already
[23.10.23, 9:32:08] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: nope
[23.10.23, 9:32:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i would start a live chat
[23.10.23, 9:32:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 10 days is to long
[23.10.23, 9:32:25] ~ Maxi: They are doing some background checks
[23.10.23, 9:32:28] ~ Maxi: Check your email
[23.10.23, 9:32:42] ~ Maxi: You received maybe a request to show your docs
[23.10.23, 9:32:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: probably they need some info indeed
[23.10.23, 9:32:54] ~ Maxi: They aren’t alerting you on dashboard anymore
[23.10.23, 9:33:05] ~ Jeremy Leppink: oh that i didnt know hahah
[23.10.23, 9:33:14] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Okey will take a look
[23.10.23, 9:33:16] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: thanks
[23.10.23, 10:08:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: anyone here selling products starting over 100$ succesfully? whats the % on your checkout?
[23.10.23, 10:48:45] ~ Kevin kreative: This is Hongkong agency ad account. You should use another type which is less restricted. I'm using agency which charge 3-4% of amount spent but no restriction on pages. Pretty stable
[23.10.23, 10:49:25] ~ Ciel: Will pm you about it!
[23.10.23, 11:58:35] ~ Sang: My business got a AM 2500 BM, i can share if u need - 0% fee , no restriction on pages/ domains . Cashback on large spend also ‎<This message was edited>
[23.10.23, 11:59:03] ~ lengjoo: you get cashback from fb? oo

[23.10.23, 12:00:31] ~ Sang: don't know how they found me
[23.10.23, 12:00:41] ~ lengjoo: we've been ignoring fb calls lol
[23.10.23, 12:01:10] ~ Sang: i use the hongkong account before
[23.10.23, 12:01:18] ~ Sang: restricted on pages/ domain
[23.10.23, 12:01:24] ~ Sang: huge cashback
[23.10.23, 12:01:29] ~ Malik: When you say no restriction, it means that on one Ad account you can use a lot of domains ? My agency also is forcing me to have one domain per ad account and we can't test fast
[23.10.23, 12:01:35] ~ Sang: but now the AM BM is much better
[23.10.23, 12:01:46] ~ Sang: yes , any domain / pages
[23.10.23, 12:01:52] ~ Malik: that's nice !
[23.10.23, 12:02:05] ~ Malik: I'll keep that in mind thanks Sang
[23.10.23, 12:04:38] ~ Maxi: I can hook you up with my provider.

It’s Chinese accounts aswell but 3% top up + you can use pages as you wish.

Only thing is you need to link your pixel to their BM that’s it.
[23.10.23, 14:00:01] ~ RS: Haha, they Also pay me 2% cashback of my adspend every quarter😀 No monthly fees etc. Spend 400k in 4 months, Get 8k cashback 😀
[23.10.23, 14:01:04] ~ RS: But also Limited to one domain per ad acc. But can use up to 5 FB pages, but still with the same domain. Cannot add new pages after ad account is created.
[23.10.23, 14:03:50] ~ Sang: it is good , in my case , i get 5%
[23.10.23, 14:04:25] ~ RS: Wow. Thats really huge cashback
[23.10.23, 14:04:39] ~ Malik: Do you need a minimum of spend per month ? @⁨~Sang⁩
[23.10.23, 14:06:26] ~ Santi Roa: Does it have a maximum?
[23.10.23, 14:19:07] ~ Nicco: Wow, crazy cashback. how much do you spend per month on ads?
[23.10.23, 14:35:04] ~ G M: You get it from your agency accounts, or directly from your AM of your bm?
[23.10.23, 14:43:28] ~ Taneen Choudhury: What do you do when you someone is stealing your content? We had a connect that would remove the ads but he isn't replying anymore, any advice?
[23.10.23, 14:43:46] ~ Luka: FB Ads? DMCA it, FB is pretty good with removing it
[23.10.23, 14:44:35] ~ Daniel Lai: there’s a copyright form you can fill in, normally it removes content in like a day, however, for me it’s been really slow recently
[23.10.23, 14:50:07] ~ Nicco: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/copyrightform

This worked for us, though only with those who had copied and pasted our video. For those who only take pieces of clips, I don't know.
[23.10.23, 14:55:59] ~ Santi Roa: Do you have trademarks or copyright protection? If so, you can access some copyright enterprise tools from FB to report all at once and it's easier
[23.10.23, 14:56:47] ~ Santi Roa: We get about 30 to 40 people copying us every week. We get their pages blocked and their BMs as well without paying to any service, just by enforcing copyright ‎<This message was edited>
[23.10.23, 14:57:15] ~ Taneen Choudhury: Do you have a VA do this? Do you have any SOP’s?
[23.10.23, 14:59:55] ~ Santi Roa: My CS team do it once a week
[23.10.23, 15:00:23] ~ Santi Roa: Do you have a published trademark in the US? I mean an already approved trademark
[23.10.23, 15:00:26] ~ Santi Roa: Not just filled
[23.10.23, 15:00:27] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: For us it's the opposite problem

We have people reporting copyrights even though our content is our own.

Anyone knows a good course on klaviyo / email marketing ?

[23.10.23, 18:38:22] ~ Haroon: I could, but if a real Looking human profile outreaches i feel like the Response rate Would be higher because there is a face attached, its more ,,organic´´ than professional if you get what i mean, it could get higher Response rate and catch Attention since Influencers get Messages from these professional accounts all the time. Thats why I am asking,  what are you guys experience?
[23.10.23, 20:07:48] Matán Intsuper: i'm not sure if you guys noticed but now if I change ad-set name in FB Ad Manager it goes into processing and review again (just name)

I know you all got a bunch of good advice about email but I'll be throwing my hat in the ring. 

And if you're wondering why, just take a look at the screenshots for one of my favourite ecom clients... 

*Yeah, baby!* 

I'll be going over emails from a copy perspective. 

And I'll be giving away one of my favourite custom GPT prompts for promotional emails.

I know it's a busy time of year but you won't want to miss this one. 

Peace and success to you all!

[24.10.23, 6:51:52] ~ Kevin kreative: Chase Dimond or just use boutique email marketing agency. All you need is to direct them strategy. I use new & small one. They lack of strategy knowledge but are willing to learn.

Good sign is the price is very reasonable ($500-$1k). Bad sign is that you have to micro-manage little bit (once per week)
[24.10.23, 8:50:53] René Crooijmans: Anyone got experience with EcommOps? Are they worth the higher price? ‎<This message was edited>

[24.10.23, 18:22:35] ~ Kevin Krieg: Will reply in DM. But for the record, it might be because you have a flag on your user from the previous ban. Its like with FB. If you misbehave in the eyes of the system, you get traced down

[25.10.23, 9:15:06] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Does anyone have a work around Shopify Payments holds? They have now put 2 FULL holds on my stores without warnings, usually they put 10-20% hold which is workable. But I cant take the FULL hold since I have over $50,000+ stuck with $25,877 in product COSTs that have to be paid if I want to fulfill🥴 I think its so counter productive by Shopify.
[25.10.23, 9:36:38] ~ Sang: pick the first guys u see in fiverr for $100-$200, they are all good . I did it all time , 95-97 speed score

[25.10.23, 9:52:34] ~ Daniel: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[25.10.23, 9:55:05] René Crooijmans: What reason did they give
[25.10.23, 10:19:16] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: "Your business has been identified as presenting an elevated level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support with Shopify Payments. See the Shopify Payments Terms of Service and click on your region. Please note that while you will no longer be permitted to use Shopify Payments as your payment gateway, this does not affect your use of Shopify."
[25.10.23, 10:19:50] ~ lengjoo: what’s yr dispute rate
[25.10.23, 10:20:54] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: On this store I have zero since its only 12 Days old
[25.10.23, 10:21:04] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: But they send me this right away
[25.10.23, 10:21:22] ~ lengjoo: oo did you have other stores shut down before?
[25.10.23, 10:21:39] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I have never gotten them shut down before
[25.10.23, 10:21:46] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: only 10-20% holds
[25.10.23, 10:22:01] ~ Rajat Grover: In which country does your company is located?
[25.10.23, 10:22:25] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Now out of nowhere they have put FULL holds on 2 of my new stores and they have only been Active in October
[25.10.23, 10:22:30] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Swedeb
[25.10.23, 10:23:10] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I would like if they give me a warning Before, like the 10-20% holds you usually get

[25.10.23, 11:15:22] René Crooijmans: Lawyer would probably be your best bet
[25.10.23, 11:15:31] René Crooijmans: There’s a few in this group

[25.10.23, 17:43:27] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, do you also have that order bumps in funnelish are seen as a separate sale in Shopify? Or did I link the automation wrong then? it's a bit frustrating for my VIP list segment in Klaviyo.

(@⁨~Y⁩)
[25.10.23, 17:44:14] ~ Adonis A: Hey @everyone Any ess members in Medellin rn?
[25.10.23, 17:44:17] René Crooijmans: Yes bro
[25.10.23, 17:44:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: It’s seperate
[25.10.23, 17:44:39] René Crooijmans: You need to turn on bundling on every product and set it to:

7-8 min for your initial sale
4-5 min for your first upsell
2-3 for your second upsell
[25.10.23, 17:44:49] René Crooijmans: You can do that in the automation settings in Funnelish
[25.10.23, 17:44:58] René Crooijmans: If you do that all products will be bundled into one order
[25.10.23, 17:48:43] ~ Y: @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩ this 👆
[25.10.23, 18:26:46] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys, does anyone have a contact for a programmer skilled in solving Shopify and apps related issues? The page builder app is causing issues with the currency conversion. Didn't have much success yet with the support from Shopify or PageFly. I tried to contact some Shopify 'Partners' but they told me to contact Shopify support lol. Losing my mind over this problem 🤣
[25.10.23, 18:36:52] ~ David B: Dmed you.
[25.10.23, 19:03:55] ~ Chris Koh: Try GemPages of course, I can help you to get it resolved haha
[25.10.23, 19:19:13] ~ Alessandro Sassi: That would last resort, rebuilding all the website will take so much time
[25.10.23, 19:22:54] René Crooijmans: Someone on fiverr will do it perfecty for a few $100
[25.10.23, 19:23:50] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Will try, but I didn't have much luck with guys on Fiverr for theme-related bugs
[25.10.23, 19:28:26] René Crooijmans: Rebuilding the site I meant

[25.10.23, 21:26:43] ~ Maxi: You doing your mails in-house ?
[25.10.23, 21:51:37] ~ David B: We have an email agency called TitanLabs. We write the copy for number of 8 and 9 figure brands.
[26.10.23, 0:17:08] Topi: Hey guys any SEO gurus here? Would love to ask few questiosn about authority sites
‎[26.10.23, 11:43:33] ~ Alessandro Sassi: ‎image omitted
[26.10.23, 13:31:08] ~ Chris Koh: May I inbox you for further discussion my friend
[26.10.23, 13:31:50] ~ Chris Koh: Currently not yet but I believe this is essential, would love to support you to make it happen.
[26.10.23, 14:17:38] ~ Santi Roa: The main thing would be compatibility with the Translate Shopify App (for me)
[26.10.23, 14:20:12] Carlos Leeseman: Hey gusy! Which site allows you to see email flows from others?
[26.10.23, 14:21:20] ~ David B: The best one is https://app.mailcharts.com/ in my opinion.
[26.10.23, 14:23:14] ~ David B: https://reallygoodemails.com is good for inspo. Let me know if you need help with email.
[26.10.23, 14:34:02] Carlos Leeseman: Thanks!!! Will check it out
[26.10.23, 15:34:18] Topi: Anyone using Klarna + shopify trought stripe? Any issues, something would be aware of? Looking to use this until my actual merchant account goes through
[26.10.23, 15:43:31] ~ Maxi: Managing the disputes will be an issue because you wont have a dashboard - only emails from klarna

Klarna disputes will count as chargebacks on your stripe account aswell
[26.10.23, 15:45:34] Topi: Ok, thank you
[26.10.23, 15:48:31] René Crooijmans: I know 2 people who got permanently banned because of this integration, while having healthy dispute rates
[26.10.23, 15:48:45] René Crooijmans: Margin for error seems to be smaller
[26.10.23, 15:52:48] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I need your technical advice


Microsoft has blocked our e-mail address

Support@notremarque.com
We were able to create a new one And we changed our contact address on all our funnels, shopify, all our facebook pages etc.

But every day we receive +400 e-mails still on our old address, and it's impossible to forward, impossible to reply.

What would you do in my place? We've already contacted Microsoft support to no avail
[26.10.23, 15:59:00] Topi: I have 1 dispute out of every 1000 orders or less, do you still think it would be risky? We call these random customers and usually they have opened it by accident and agree to cancel. Thank you for the insights
[26.10.23, 15:59:54] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, we are having our Creative Sourcing/Content call as usual now. Let's help you guys with anything Content related. Join here: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87654957947
[26.10.23, 16:06:14] ~ Santi Roa: I think this happened to us once, let me see if I got an SOP
[26.10.23, 16:06:45] ~ Santi Roa: I thibk what we did was disconnecting the domain from Microsoft 365 and creating a free email address with Zoho
[26.10.23, 16:06:49] ~ Santi Roa: Same domain, same address
[26.10.23, 16:07:17] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Oh it will be amazing
[26.10.23, 16:18:13] ~ BG: Did the call finish ?
[26.10.23, 16:26:08] ~ lengjoo: anyone currently using retention.com with funnelish?
[26.10.23, 16:26:10] ~ lengjoo: how has it been?
[26.10.23, 17:41:03] ~ Mikael: Did anyone change back to the original checkout and experience any difference?
[26.10.23, 17:43:18] ~ RS: I hope that shopify will finally switch back my store to 3PC 😀 After OPC conversion rate dropped twice. Not on Plus so I cannot switch back yet
[26.10.23, 18:48:33] ~ Mikael: do you need plus to switch to 3PC?
[26.10.23, 18:51:23] ~ RS: Yeah. But they say that they are working now to allow regular plans to switch back to 3PC. Sounds like a BS, but I have already asked them many times to switch my store back to 3PC. I have submitted evidence that proves that the checkout is buggy, many customers cannot check out, checkout freezes when they pay, also shows “incorrect email or phone number” to some customers. Also shows payment error for some cards if you autofill them etc.
[26.10.23, 18:56:31] ~ Mikael: yeah we also have some issues with freezes and keeps loading. the CVR whent down 50% for us
[26.10.23, 19:04:34] ~ RS: Same bro. CR 50% down.
[26.10.23, 19:35:20] ~ Peter: ‎~ Peter joined using a group link.

He and his team are top notch with brand development, product development and building amazing long term brands. I had an interview with him back in July and he shared behind the scenes of their operation, it’s insane! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fMufbYbGYrM&pp=ygUVQWxleCBmZWRvdG9mZiBjb2N1bmF0

Nows he’s looking to master funnels and good direct response stuff!

Please give him a warm welcome!!!
[26.10.23, 20:18:37] ~ David B: Welcome to the group @~Ignasi.
[27.10.23, 3:30:56] ~ Natasha Iris: @⁨~Ignasi⁩ welcome to the group! 🚀✨
[27.10.23, 4:45:24] ~ seth: Hello everyone, we're currently facing an issue with Funnelish where some customers are entering incorrect addresses, leading to the need for us to reach out and correct these addresses manually. Has anyone else encountered this problem, and if so, how did you go about resolving it?
[27.10.23, 8:01:49] ~ Nim: I'd confirm you've got these three things in place first before you troubleshoot further:

1) ensure each form field settings are correct i.e.<shipping state>, <shipping city> etc. As these are quite sensitive (confirm with their support desk)

2) enable form field Labels 

3) put super clear filed Placeholders (making it super clear what you expect them to input)

This has solved most of the issues for us. ‎<This message was edited>
[27.10.23, 8:52:47] ~ Robin: Hey, which cart Upsell ap do you guys recommend? I have some real trouble with monster cart. Is there any other good app that I can try out to increase AOV?

[27.10.23, 10:46:42] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Did anyone here use a AI generated spokesperson as authority figure? So not only voice but someone actually talking AI generated
[27.10.23, 13:12:23] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys! Best solution in order to avoid feedback score bans?
[27.10.23, 13:13:31] ~ RS: If you dont have good Shipping times, good product etc, then I should suggest you to buy feedback scores

[27.10.23, 14:27:47] ~ Robin: Anyone here from Germany 🇩🇪? Will test that market, have some questions
[27.10.23, 14:28:14] ~ Mubasel: Yea let me dm you
[27.10.23, 14:33:35] ~ Maxi: Germany was usually my main market
[27.10.23, 14:33:40] ~ Maxi: Now slowly pivoting to the US
[27.10.23, 14:35:17] ~ Mikael: anyone here know of a great Currency converter app or something that Changes the currency in the bckground or whatever? We have each domain for each market but we want to use our .com website to all English speaking countrys but need a great currency converter just for this domain. So we dont want the currency converter to mess with the other domains
[27.10.23, 14:47:34] ~ Santi Roa: Are you using a shopify theme?
[27.10.23, 14:47:59] ~ Mikael: yes shopify paid theme. it have some currency picker in it. but i dont know if its automatic
[27.10.23, 14:48:28] ~ Santi Roa: We use just the geolocation app (disable the popup) and enable local currency on each market. Then somewhere you can turn on "automatic" and it should work
[27.10.23, 14:48:42] ~ Santi Roa: You can test it out online using a website to access your site from another country
[27.10.23, 14:49:04] ~ Santi Roa: We set it up long time ago so Idk how we did it but it was easy
[27.10.23, 14:49:04] ~ Mikael: oh easy. so this actually "redirects" the rigth currency to the visitor?
[27.10.23, 14:55:47] ~ Santi Roa: Yeah
[27.10.23, 14:56:05] ~ Santi Roa: Without redirecting the domain (you have to set this up on the markets settings to always use .com)
[27.10.23, 14:56:51] ~ Santi Roa: Test it out, if it doesn't work then speak to support, or get an app if there's no way around it, but I am sure it's possible without it
[27.10.23, 14:59:46] ~ Robin: Awesome, writing to you in DM
[27.10.23, 14:59:55] ~ Robin: Awesome, writing to you in DM
[27.10.23, 16:20:47] ~ ‎Carl Weische: anybody has a klarna connect who can get an account unbanned / get a new account?
[27.10.23, 17:32:17] ~ Natasha Iris: I DM’d you
[28.10.23, 11:39:58] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Anyone know how we can A/B in Checkout

I have shopify + and convert and Measuring changes at the checkout

But shopify no longer allows access to the liquid checkout aPI
[28.10.23, 16:55:26] ~ Robin: My upsell on funnelish won’t sync with Shopify, so every order when someone adds the upsell doesn’t get synced. Does Anyone know why? The support is unavailable today
[28.10.23, 17:12:45] ~ Luka: What's the most cost-effective way of getting Shutter Stock Videos? They have by far the best selection but they're very pricey even if you buy their higher packages
[28.10.23, 17:33:49] ~ Nim: Have you added the automation in Funnelish and linked it to a product in Shopify?
Secondly, check you've selected the correct upsell product in the YES-OTO-Link in funnelish
[29.10.23, 7:59:04] ~ Daniel: hey guys, I got several emails saying that I'm blocked from posting for 3 days because I infringed on someone's copyright property, but all the content I have is custom. Now I can't create new ads, or adjust my budgets fro the next 3 days, does anyone know how I can see what content was reported, and how I can counter it?
[29.10.23, 8:36:09] ~ lengjoo: from FB?
[29.10.23, 9:00:15] ~ Daniel: yeah
[29.10.23, 9:02:22] ~ Daniel: someone reported me to fb
[29.10.23, 9:03:14] ~ Daniel: couple days ago got a fake DMCA too, so I think someone doesn’t like me, bc all of my content is custom, and they don’t have anything to report me for
[29.10.23, 9:23:38] ~ lengjoo: oh never encountered that.. do you have an account manager you can reach out to?
[29.10.23, 10:15:35] ~ RS: Have something changed in FB? Or you just saw the email? I am getting over 10+ phishing emails telling that ad acc is banned, that page is restricted etc. But all these are fake emails. If you check the email sender, it is not Facebook, its some random scam email
[29.10.23, 10:17:52] ~ RS: ‎This message was deleted.

[29.10.23, 10:20:18] ~ RS: Some emails look very fake, but some look real asf😀 And they are usually sent to my FB page email not to the BM admin email
[29.10.23, 10:34:31] ~ Farhat Godil: Same thing happened to me few days ago and I was locked out of my Facebook for 3 days and couldn’t touch my ads .

First thing to do after you get your access back is to add backup admin on your BM
[29.10.23, 10:35:10] ~ Daniel: unfortunately no, how do you usually get one?
[29.10.23, 10:35:25] ~ Daniel: I’ve spent over 2 mil. on this ad acc, and still don’t have one
[29.10.23, 10:36:01] ~ Daniel: no no, for me it’s actually correct, bc I can’t create new campaigns
[29.10.23, 10:36:23] ~ Daniel: yeah, me too, but I don’t open them, they’re scammers
[29.10.23, 10:37:07] ~ Daniel: got it, after 3 days everything was back to normal?
[29.10.23, 10:37:25] ~ Farhat Godil: Yes it was
[29.10.23, 10:42:21] ~ EasyGloss (Anela): Guys, do we have some text somewhere to copy-paste to send to Facebook when they restrict your advertising account?
[29.10.23, 10:44:53] ~ G M: create it on chatgpt
[29.10.23, 10:46:09] ~ EasyGloss (Anela): thanks! But what do we say these days? Do we say we are sorry and we will never do it again - or do we say we are not aware that we did something wrong becasue we know and follow the Facebook policies?
[29.10.23, 10:53:48] ~ G M: Just put the prompt on ChatGPT and He will give you many templates
[29.10.23, 13:56:26] ~ Harvey: Anyone here set up accurate tracking for Google ads on Funnelish?

[29.10.23, 14:07:50] ~ lengjoo: i’ll dm you too
[29.10.23, 15:15:48] ~ RS: Hey, guys. If I am reselling items on my ecommerce store using Google Shopping, they’re keep asking for GTIN numbers for each product, size etc in order to resolve the limited perfomance, should I pay attention to that or it’s not really affecting?
[29.10.23, 15:36:34] ~ Vasile: you should pay attention. You can ask your supplier to provide you the GTINs. If they don't have it, you can create custom ones: https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes
[29.10.23, 15:37:02] ~ RS: Thanks man! Will check this
[29.10.23, 15:39:55] ~ Vasile: Great. But tbh, I have conducted any before/after analysis to advertise for the same brand without and with GTINs to offer you some hard data.
[29.10.23, 15:40:50] ~ RS: Will keep in mind, Thanks!
[29.10.23, 16:26:28] ~ lengjoo: yo guys, does anyone know of any company in the US we can get packaging inserts from?

[29.10.23, 22:08:21] ~ Tim Alleraun: Does Shopify Plus only lower external gateway fees or does it also come with lower Shopify Payment fees compared to the advanced plan?
[29.10.23, 23:55:53] Yaniv: Yes it’s 1.9% or 1.8% + 30 cent for USD processing
[30.10.23, 1:42:12] ~ Santi Roa: Really? Did you negotiated it?

[2.11.23, 8:41:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Try Revolut or Sterlex
[2.11.23, 8:41:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Sterlex is multicurrency
[2.11.23, 8:41:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But that one is a little harder to get in to
[2.11.23, 8:42:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Revolut is fairly easy
[2.11.23, 8:44:31] ~ Denys: I'm not a resident and I have a business wise account for my LLP, I haven't opened it by myself, but I think you should try proxy with UK IP address, when you are trying to open that
[2.11.23, 8:50:07] ~ Rajat Grover: Revolut not accepting applications 

Sterlex or starling?  

starling is also not accepting

[2.11.23, 9:23:19] ~ busy: in case you want to close your llp are you filling a yearly tax return or submitting something before closing it? even if ure not a uk resident nor have uk source income ‎<This message was edited>
[2.11.23, 9:24:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Im not planning on closing them as im moving to Dubai right now, my LLP serves as a collecting company. And because i have a LLP i can get it fixed that i dont need to fill in yearly tax or anything like that
[2.11.23, 9:24:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Maybe try sterlex, im not sure then
[2.11.23, 9:25:04] ~ G M: What do you mean as a collecting company?
[2.11.23, 9:26:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Only my revenue goes to the LLP, i make 0 costs there. No marketing, no salary nothing. 

So this is collecting, the money goes to my FZCO (Dubai company) this way its tax free as Dubai is tax free
[2.11.23, 9:27:28] ~ G M: Ok and all the payment gateway you have are with uk llp then?
[2.11.23, 9:27:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Yes

[2.11.23, 9:27:50] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Because i cant get those in Dubai.
[2.11.23, 9:28:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Stripe, and also applying for Adyen
[2.11.23, 9:28:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Want to try Mollie as well but that one will probably not let me in
[2.11.23, 9:28:28] ~ G M: Okok
[2.11.23, 9:29:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For me opening a LLP for non resident i did it with firstchoiceformations. It was clear and easy with them

[2.11.23, 12:11:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: definetely someting in your checkout isnt working
[2.11.23, 12:11:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 108 and 7 is not good
[2.11.23, 12:12:04] ~ Jeremy Leppink: maybe something in the form they have to fill in
[2.11.23, 12:19:46] ~ Alessandro Sassi: probably checkout issue.. happened to me also, multicurrency stopped working randomly one day
[2.11.23, 12:24:59] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Okay founded!

A problem shopify market indicated no more means of delivery,

Warning: the geolocation application seems to have some bugs.

Thank you guys
[2.11.23, 12:59:29] ~ Santi Roa: I don't think so, it depends on how strong is your account structure, but unless you are spending over 2m/month you shouldn't worry about competing against yourself
[2.11.23, 12:59:58] ~ Santi Roa: The only issue could be if you run same creative same audience same everything but even like that sometimes work
[2.11.23, 13:01:15] ~ Santi Roa: We duplicate a lot of shit at high budgets (2k day per adset) and they do not compete with each other. If you manage creative production/fatigue then the other problems almost dissappear
[2.11.23, 13:36:49] ~ Bilel: Also depends on the offer/creatives. Some offers seem to be getting into overlap easier than others

[2.11.23, 17:23:30] ~ Santi Roa: We were hiring, she got to the final interview out of 200 candidates, but we decided not to hire because we had supply chain issues for Q4 and wouldn't be able to scale
[2.11.23, 17:23:39] ~ Santi Roa: Dm me if you want her info

3s money said yes and they are charging like $100 per month and 3 months in-advance fee and if I closed the account than $550 as fee

This option appears to be the quickest and most optimal right now - any questions, let me know.

[4.11.23, 13:08:09] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Guys, it looks like several of us are having conversion rate variations theses day?

What would be the cause facebook, shopify checkout?
[4.11.23, 13:09:51] ~ Maxi: I have it aswell in funnelish
[4.11.23, 13:10:04] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Yes, since yesterday cr went from 1.5%+ to 0.5%
[4.11.23, 13:10:33] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I suggest that we find the root cause and fix this problem together
[4.11.23, 13:11:40] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Some use Funnelish others shopify

The common denominator remains facebook
[4.11.23, 13:14:04] ~ Maxi: Exactly
[4.11.23, 13:14:48] ~ Maxi: Usually it’s always being said that we can’t blame FB
[4.11.23, 13:14:58] ~ Maxi: But if so many people having issues …
[4.11.23, 14:07:29] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jo guys, im running Dutch market in health niche. Tested multiple different products and multiple variations of VSLs, multiple variations of advertorials etc but cant seem to get ANY result. Like literally 0 sales on most tests after few 100 spend lol. 

Somehow all VSLs get same results as in hookrates, retention rates, cpm/clicks all very similar. Although de VSLs are very different. 

Little bit more info about buildup of the VSLs, I dont use custom content yet. I try to minimize stock footage and if i use it i animate it, further product footage i get online from competitors and stuff, used multiple proven scripts and formats, no results. 

Advertorials get good ctr like 35% or higher, sales page also around 70%ish. 

Im kinda lost 😂 

Im looking for some tips to get some results so i know where and what to focus on, or maybe have suggestions?

I appreciate any feedback!❤️
[4.11.23, 14:10:32] René Crooijmans: Personally I didn’t test with advertorials or VSL’s. I focussed on a high quality landing page, proven ad structures from foreplay, and good offers initially
[4.11.23, 14:10:57] René Crooijmans: It allowed me to test quick and save the VSL’s for the angles & formats that were working
[4.11.23, 14:13:12] René Crooijmans: in EU market VSL’s and advertorials are not a must yet. A good landing page will give you the highground when testing
[4.11.23, 14:13:16] ~ David B: What's your targeting like? Have you gone deep on researching your customers pain points? Are you offering a new angle or unique mechanism that differentiates you from the rest of the market? Is the branding on point? Is the UX experience on your sales page optimized? 

Sorry for so many questions! Feel free to DM me a link to your sales page. ‎<This message was edited>

[4.11.23, 14:29:32] ~ lengjoo: Yo guys, wanted to get your opinion, our team is built on Google Workspace at the moment, is it ever necessary to use Microsoft 365 down the line? Basically COO might want to use Mircrosoft 365 when he gets onboarded ‎<This message was edited>
[4.11.23, 14:30:56] ~ Luka: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[4.11.23, 14:30:57] ~ Nim: Defo do this 👆
I assumed you done test purchases to check checkout/Bumps and upsells all working OK?
For our market we had similar issue, we enabled PayPal and boom sales started coming. 90% sales coming using that.
[4.11.23, 14:45:32] Yaniv: Seen many complains on it from guys on twitter
[4.11.23, 14:53:16] ~ lengjoo: any reason to open a holding company here?
[4.11.23, 14:53:39] ~ P: Hey guys,

Anybody using checkify here ?
[4.11.23, 14:55:58] ~ Luka: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[4.11.23, 14:58:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thanks! Ill do this for sure.
[4.11.23, 14:58:23] ~ RS: Today my CR in shopify is 0.75%. On funnelish the same ads and targeting - 2%+
[4.11.23, 14:58:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thanks René, ill keep it in mind
[4.11.23, 14:58:56] ~ RS: Shopify checkout is broken AF. Getting some messages from customers who cannot check out
[4.11.23, 14:59:19] Yaniv: What is the error they’re getting?
[4.11.23, 15:01:26] ~ RS: Sometimes page freezes when they press on “pay now”. Sometimes it shows card declined or some other card error, even though it does not show up in stripe as declined. Sometimes when customers try to pay, shopify shows them that email is incorrect. Also if they auto-fill card details, most like they will Get payment error that does not show up in stripe. I have even disabled address auto fill in shopify. And sholify support is just shi*heads and never aggree that they have problems.
[4.11.23, 15:02:02] ~ RS: On 3PC everything was good. 1PC is just a catastrophe
[4.11.23, 15:06:09] ~ Haroon: Did you try test mode to find out where the mistake is ?
[4.11.23, 15:06:24] ~ Haroon: I feel like I had that 2 days ago in the test mode even
[4.11.23, 15:06:40] ~ Haroon: but with me it was because I put too many digits of the VISA number
[4.11.23, 15:06:44] ~ Haroon: Do a test order yourself
[4.11.23, 16:01:21] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: So if we have shopify plus you recommand 3PC checkout?
[4.11.23, 16:02:47] ~ RS: If I had an option, I would switch back to 3PC 100%. But you should test for yourself
[4.11.23, 16:06:18] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: How we can test?
[4.11.23, 16:06:46] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We use convert but we need to accès to open checkout liquid for this and Shopify doesn’t agree
[4.11.23, 16:17:16] ~ Santi Roa: Measure IC to Pur rate before and after
[4.11.23, 16:18:08] ~ Santi Roa: But if you are on Plus, 100% go back to 3pc
[4.11.23, 21:00:10] ~ Haroon: guys how yall calculate break even in a Country with VAT when you have like 3 variants a 3 pricings -> do you pick average selling Price divided by average cogs Price then?
[4.11.23, 21:02:02] Topi: Pm
[4.11.23, 21:02:15] Topi: I have a ready built sheet

[4.11.23, 21:38:37] ~ David B: If you were wondering why I am such an advocate of branding, this should provide the answer.
[4.11.23, 21:44:05] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I have seen this before, absolutely crazy😂
[4.11.23, 21:45:00] ~ David B: The psychology of branding and positioning is unbelievable.
[4.11.23, 22:58:18] ~ Ignasi: For us providing iDeal as payment method dramatically improved CR in NL
[5.11.23, 5:35:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Yes, got this 😁
[5.11.23, 5:36:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ideal and Klarna also important
[5.11.23, 10:00:24] ~ Mikael: Anyone using Geolocation app without the popup to Automatic switch currency to each country? Is this possible? as the shopify support tells me its not possible to do automatic
[5.11.23, 10:02:35] ~ Mikael: "This Geolocation Application thatś been made by Shopify are unable to show the currency automatically as the application will work only when the customer clicking their currency below the page or in pop up blocker. "
[5.11.23, 11:18:50] ~ Maxi: Hey guys, is someone using a subdomain with godaddy ?
[5.11.23, 11:19:01] ~ Maxi: Having trouble connecting subdomain from godaddy to funnelish
[5.11.23, 11:22:01] ~ Luka: Yeah I do - will be back at my PC in 30 mins and send you a screenshot of how to setup
[5.11.23, 11:23:42] ~ Maxi: Thanks man!
[5.11.23, 12:27:48] ~ lengjoo: got a bunch of rejected ads, but some don't have to option to request review (the button doesn't pop up to request a review), anyone else seeing this?
[5.11.23, 12:28:10] ~ Malik: Yeah I had it too
[5.11.23, 12:28:23] ~ Malik: Didn't find a solution yet
[5.11.23, 12:28:52] ~ lengjoo: mm that's annoying
[5.11.23, 12:30:36] ~ lengjoo: have you tried going to Business Support Home to request review for all?
[5.11.23, 12:32:29] ~ lengjoo: fb coming with another ban wave lol
[5.11.23, 12:34:59] ~ G M: From today?
[5.11.23, 12:35:09] ~ lengjoo: past few days
[5.11.23, 12:38:07] Yaniv: It is solving the problem I tried that
[5.11.23, 12:56:39] ~ lengjoo: yea just did it
[5.11.23, 13:12:36] ~ Marko: Be aware of confirmation bias. This is so common. If you mention any problem (sudden drop in conversation rate, high cpm’s or anything else) you will always find people that are experiencing the same thing in groups like these and it will seem as if it’s something everyone is experiencing. In a group with 170 people, at any given time you will easily find 5-10 people that are experiencing something similar to you, and of course they will respond when you mention your problem.
[5.11.23, 13:13:56] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: A number of factors can render the test inaccurate

The only real way is to split the traffic
[5.11.23, 13:16:11] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: You're 100% right and I think it can be a bad mindset.

My intention was rather to quickly find a solution to this drop in the conversion rate at checkout.
[5.11.23, 13:38:46] ~ L: Hey guys, have any of you ever tried those agencies that boost the feedback score by triggering Facebook polls using fake profiles?
[5.11.23, 15:11:49] ~ Santi Roa: Absolutely, but it's been experienced by most people in the space, and our drop was clear.

We tested it 2 times though just to make sure, and usually the % that goes from IC to PUR is pretty stable. I am not measuring CR or any other thing
[5.11.23, 17:44:05] ~ Daniel: hey, yes I did, it works, I can share the contact if you need
[5.11.23, 17:45:22] ~ L: Yes, that'd be great - I dm you
[5.11.23, 18:48:25] ~ David Hu: Has daylight savings impacted performance for anyone? Only selling in US
[5.11.23, 21:08:59] ~ Lareina: Hi just wanna chime in- anyone has good contact or services to recommend for dropshipping quality beauty skincare products in the USA? Appreciate it. 💥
[5.11.23, 22:08:26] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Okay interessing thank you Santi
[5.11.23, 22:25:01] ~ Kyle Twohill: Hey guys does anyone use a email capture pop up on funnelish?
[5.11.23, 22:25:14] ~ Kyle Twohill: Is it worth testing
[6.11.23, 5:39:58] ~ Santiago: Def worth a test, find the average time of LP visit and put your pop up 1-2 seconds before that average, that way you’re making sure you’re not nagging people off, also worth trying retention.com
[6.11.23, 5:50:16] ~ lengjoo: are you with them currently?
[6.11.23, 6:47:18] ~ Kyle Twohill: thanks so much ill try it out!
[6.11.23, 9:21:37] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, I need your help. Since last week the performance of our product has dropped super fast within a week. From €3k per day with 40% profits > to €0 within a week.... 

This is not the first time it has happened, we see this time and time again with our winning products. We keep actively testing creatives but even those don't catch on when we test them with our proven target audience. We are a little hopeless what to do next because this pushes us every time to let go of the product and move on to the next one. This is not quite how I envision it as we want to build a long term something.

We are selling in the Dutch market, small market. But I also see people doing €20-50k per day consistently with 1 product. for months

Who has experienced something similar and knows what the key is?
[6.11.23, 13:01:07] ~ Santi Roa: Products almost don't saturate
[6.11.23, 13:01:09] ~ Santi Roa: Ever
[6.11.23, 13:01:29] ~ Santi Roa: I've been selling the same product for 2 years, did over 10million with it, in a VERY small niche
[6.11.23, 13:01:38] ~ Santi Roa: Still doing 50k day with good margins
[6.11.23, 13:02:18] ~ Santi Roa: But, several times I thought it died.
It was always because of our marketing or business model.

Try to find the reason why it keeps dying. Otherwise it will continue happening. It's a pattern
[6.11.23, 13:02:34] ~ Maxi: top tier advice
[6.11.23, 13:02:46] ~ Maxi: Which niche are you in btw, @⁨~Santi Roa⁩
[6.11.23, 13:03:45] Carlos Leeseman: Okay thanks bro. Could it be a content issue? Wrong advertisement platform? We’re doing VSL’s now on Facebook. We’re in the health (pain) niche
[6.11.23, 13:04:10] ~ Maxi: @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩ 

Im also VSLs on facebook + advertorial + funnelish
[6.11.23, 13:04:43] ~ Santi Roa: It's a VERY small one. It had 300 searches a month when I started so imagine. If I tell you the niche you will pickup my brand instantly.

I don't mind sharing my brand but I know there's some thirsty people all around trying to find a product haha
[6.11.23, 13:05:23] ~ Santi Roa: I am not experienced in that niche. Competition is high, market is also big so I'd definitely say it's either a content issue or a trust issue
[6.11.23, 13:06:26] ~ Santi Roa: Also, if you copied someone else, then you will never know why it isn't working. I'd definitely try to improve and make your own thing
[6.11.23, 13:06:29] ~ Maxi: Im not thritsty I have my own brand 😂
[6.11.23, 13:06:37] ~ Maxi: Saw yesterday people stealing my content
[6.11.23, 13:06:37] ~ Santi Roa: Hahaha
[6.11.23, 13:06:50] ~ Maxi: Which is a compliment for me 😂
[6.11.23, 13:07:00] ~ Santi Roa: Yeah we get about 30 to 40 people stealing our content every week
[6.11.23, 13:07:04] ~ Santi Roa: Crazy
[6.11.23, 13:07:06] ~ Maxi: Hahahaha
[6.11.23, 13:07:13] ~ Maxi: You fight it ?
[6.11.23, 13:07:14] ~ Santi Roa: I get them all banned
[6.11.23, 13:07:18] Carlos Leeseman: Okay thanks bro. We’re already making our scripts by ourself and don’t copy then
[6.11.23, 13:07:24] Carlos Leeseman: But based on proven angles etc
[6.11.23, 13:07:36] ~ Maxi: I might reach out to you if I see more and more people stealing my VSLs
[6.11.23, 13:07:45] ~ Maxi: It took me a lot of work
[6.11.23, 13:07:48] ~ Santi Roa: Def start now bro
[6.11.23, 13:08:03] ~ Santi Roa: Once it becomes "public" it's harder to stop it haha
[6.11.23, 13:08:27] ~ Santi Roa: That's good. Relax, analyze what you can improve, and keep working on that
[6.11.23, 13:08:28] ~ Maxi: I’ll reach out later to you via pm
[6.11.23, 13:08:35] ~ Maxi: If you don’t mind ofc
[6.11.23, 13:09:39] ~ Santi Roa: There are 95% of chances the product isn't died and it's your marketing what's failing.

Don't be delusional though, if you copied a product someone scaled for 1 year and now 50 people is copying the same, maybe yeah is not the right time to be in that product
[6.11.23, 13:09:50] ~ Santi Roa: @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩
[6.11.23, 13:12:03] Carlos Leeseman: Okay okay, good point
[6.11.23, 15:56:17] ~ Hamza: ‎Lucia Van added ~ Hamza
[6.11.23, 15:47:50] ~ David: Hi, any advice or documents to share with facebook in order to recover a FB Page?
[6.11.23, 17:15:13] Carlos Leeseman: How do you guys test new creatives? I'm constantly testing multiple hooks in 1 adset now, but it feels like I'm not giving all the hooks a chance then.... 

Is it better to do only 1 hook with 3 different copy’s in 1 adset? Do you do €20 or €50 budget per adset?
[6.11.23, 17:15:53] ~ Maxi: I just add 10-20 hooks in 1x adset 200-500€ budget and whatever works, works
[6.11.23, 17:16:33] Carlos Leeseman: Dahmm
[6.11.23, 17:16:44] Carlos Leeseman: ABO, broad?
[6.11.23, 17:16:52] ~ Maxi: Yes
[6.11.23, 17:17:16] Carlos Leeseman: Curious about others
[6.11.23, 17:25:01] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I test them in a broad CBO. Each test is a new DCT adset 3 videos (ex. 3 different hooks of the same video), 2 headlines, 2 copy. If I have a winner I put it in the main adset in the same campaign
[6.11.23, 17:41:02] ~ L: ABO - adsets broad - no more than 1 ad p. Adset 

Whenever I find something that works I make another ABO just to test hooks 

I like to give every video/hook the same budget
[6.11.23, 17:42:56] Carlos Leeseman: Fun to see everyone doing something different.
[6.11.23, 19:23:54] ~ David B: *Hey all.* 

The people have spoken. 

We will be taking a look at VSLs on the copy call tomorrow. WOOP WOOP. 

Tomorrow I'll share with you: 

The 10 question structure for insanely effective VSLs.
The reason behind the success of VSLs. 
And the all so important ToV… 

If your VSLs sound like they were written by Stephen Hawking for Neil deGrasse Tyson, ain't nobody watching those. 

If you have VSLs you want critiqued, bring them along to the call. 

See you there. 

PS: If you haven't already seen it, you should go and check out Alex's Youtube video with Peter Kell. It's a goldmine of insights. 

The main takeaway? You're probably NOT testing enough.

[6.11.23, 20:17:40] ~ Kyle Twohill: How is your feedback score
[6.11.23, 20:17:57] Carlos Leeseman: Currently low
[6.11.23, 20:20:31] ~ lengjoo: hey guys, need some technical help/knowledge here about domains. so basically we bought a new domain but we can't change the redirect link on FB directly.

anyone know if it's possible to redirect for example, from brandname.com to newbrandname.com/products/productname?
[6.11.23, 20:25:26] ~ Rajat Grover: Yeah via page rules  it’s easy in cloudflare

Else via code in html or maybe permanent redirect
[6.11.23, 20:26:03] ~ lengjoo: sounds complicated 😂
[6.11.23, 20:26:08] ~ lengjoo: im a tech noob
[6.11.23, 20:26:38] ~ Rajat Grover: 😅 if you want, I can do that for you or guide you step by step

Dm me
[6.11.23, 20:46:46] ~ Santi Roa: What,if you do it on shopify? You can connect multiple domains and have them redirect to your main one. Not the ideal but possible depending on your situation
[6.11.23, 20:47:39] ~ Santi Roa: If you are switching domain but don't want to lose optimization on your current ads, then just do it on shopify and start using the new domain for future ads
[6.11.23, 20:47:49] ~ Santi Roa: But if it's something more specific then idk

[6.11.23, 22:21:51] ~ David: Hey guys, any advice or documents to share with facebook in order to recover a FB Page?
[7.11.23, 6:44:23] ~ lengjoo: it's more specific like from domain (brand.com) to specific landing page (newbrand.com/products/name)
[7.11.23, 8:06:29] ~ Bilel: Is anyone using in-checkout upsells/cross sells on Shopify?
[7.11.23, 11:07:11] ~ RS: To all people that are having huge drops from IC-PUR since shopify implemented one page checkout. I heard a possible solution, tried it, and now my CR went from 1-1,5% to 3,5%. It might work for you as well, so better try this. Just delete your Shipping rates, save, and then create New Shipping rates. Customers often had errors when they tried to place order, and deleting Shipping rates can hell to fix this.
[7.11.23, 11:30:56] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: How do you setup iDEAL payments without Shopify Payments?
[7.11.23, 11:36:01] ~ Marko: Mollie
[7.11.23, 11:45:15] Carlos Leeseman: Does a low feedback score have a lot of impact on performance?
[7.11.23, 11:45:34] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I notice a difference
[7.11.23, 11:45:49] ~ Allan L: Mollie makes your checkout to have the payment in a different window. Meaning a extra step, i believe Stripe can be done as with credit card
[7.11.23, 11:46:27] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I have stripe for credit card but can iDEAL be added there?
[7.11.23, 11:46:41] René Crooijmans: Yup stripe supports ideal
[7.11.23, 11:47:53] ~ Daniel: when mine dropped I went from 20% profit margins to breakeven-negative, and then back to 20% margins after I bought feedback score
[7.11.23, 11:53:02] ~ Marko: Where do you guys find the feedback score
[7.11.23, 11:53:09] ~ Marko: Seems impossible to find
[7.11.23, 11:53:20] Carlos Leeseman: I’ve 2 good agency’s

[7.11.23, 14:22:06] ~ Daniel: hey guys, what’s the best platform for finding UGC creators?
[7.11.23, 14:29:58] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Did you put same thumbnail? Is very important facebook can spend on best thumbnail otherwise
[7.11.23, 14:30:49] Carlos Leeseman: What do you mean? I always select first frame of video as thumbnail
[7.11.23, 14:31:34] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: You need to test your new creatives with your winning thumbnail

Just wanted to say that @⁨~Avv. Isidoro Capuano⁩ was able to release our hold for our business and re-establish compliance with our processor. For anybody struggling with holds he is the man.

[7.11.23, 19:13:56] ~ Peter: That’s true and also hardly anyone actually has youtube premium
[7.11.23, 19:13:57] ~ Peter: So this isn’t worrisome

[7.11.23, 20:56:03] ~ P: Heard they are significantly cheaper
[7.11.23, 20:56:21] Carlos Leeseman: Not on Influee?
[7.11.23, 20:56:42] ~ P: Tbh last time i checked it was super expensive
[7.11.23, 21:00:55] Carlos Leeseman: Hmmm. Yeah it’s €200 for a month. But you can find some high quality creators
[7.11.23, 21:03:37] Matán Intsuper: Contact them directly on instagram and TikTok
[7.11.23, 21:07:01] Carlos Leeseman: They’ve hide the usernames now haha
[7.11.23, 22:53:15] ~ Tim Alleraun: Anyway to speed up naming all my adsets and ads in Meta? I want the ads to be named automatically after my creative name
[8.11.23, 1:21:45] ~ Marko: Does anyone know of any aitools for video creation? Trying to use heygen but you have to prove that it’s you in the video otherwise you can’t use it
[8.11.23, 12:54:14] ~ Allan L: Anyone knows a cheap place to play UK trustpilot reviews?
[8.11.23, 13:44:25] ~ Ciel: Hi we’re trying to set up WhatsApp business for client communication, but it keeps getting banned after we send a few messages. 

Any solution?
[8.11.23, 14:51:48] ~ lengjoo: for people shipping from their 3PL in US, how much is fair for picking and packing a packaging insert for each order? lol

[8.11.23, 17:10:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: How we do it is through CS
[8.11.23, 17:11:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: If a person is satisfied with the customer service or any other matter we ask them to leave a Trustpilot review
[8.11.23, 17:11:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: This resulted in loads of 5 star reviews on a general dropshipping store
[8.11.23, 17:12:29] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Before i didnt do it and it dropped to like 1.4 or something, i got it to 2.6 fairly quickly just doing it this way, and thats not too bad imo for a general store

My goal in joining is to scale my knowledge and stores to 400k+ stores and to learn branding and perfect the craft.
Hope to learn from you guys, and always open to network! 🚀

[8.11.23, 20:45:08] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey guys, with the holiday season upon us, it’s important to not only make sales but also ensure that you are managing fraud and risk; particularly in international markets!

Did you know?

Across all merchants that dispute a chargeback, only 20% of the time they win the dispute. 

With the customer and the issuing banks having final say, once the chargeback is accepted, the disputed amount is returned to the cardholder and the merchant also incurs additional fees, normally $25 per chargeback. 

Find out how to protect yourself and reduce fraud/chargebacks on today’s payments call below:

[8.11.23, 21:55:44] ~ Bryan T: We’re out of the US mostly now but I’ve talked to 50+ 3PL here and a fair price for pick and pack is generally in the 1.50-2.50 range, insert should also be in the .10-.20 range per unit.
[8.11.23, 21:56:09] ~ Alex Noghreh: Any you would recommend ?
[8.11.23, 22:00:18] ~ Bryan T: Really depends on your product/needs, I’d only recommend US fulfillment if you have a light/small product and or need faster shipping times (1-3 days). For something super light I’ve heard a lot of good things about https://dollarfulfillment.com but we’re larger than this and couldn’t find a partner that made sense with our setup.

Right now Im doing an ABO with 5 Lookalike Audiences of the ATC so 1%, 1-2%, 2-3%, 3-4%, 4-5% with €10 each and the creative is the Winner but with discount code on the upper and lower part.

They are all older and I need to find a good solution to make it easy for them to upload it, does anyone here have any tips for this?
[9.11.23, 11:43:11] ~ Rajat Grover: Google Drive > Dropbox
[9.11.23, 11:43:12] ~ Rajat Grover: and you have plenty of options for cloudstorage
[9.11.23, 11:43:13] ~ Rajat Grover: you can provide them a link
[9.11.23, 11:43:13] ~ Rajat Grover: to upload directly
[9.11.23, 11:43:37] ~ David B: You can give them access to a google drive and have them upload them there.
[9.11.23, 11:44:19] ~ David B: That's the fastest way if you aren't getting million of them at once. After that, you need to have an automated system. Cloud storage is the MVP here.
[9.11.23, 11:45:10] Bob: Okay thanks guys, I will do this!

[9.11.23, 16:47:33] ~ Ignasi: Advantage+ campaigns, 10-50 ads, 10-50x your ideal CPA as budget. 100% new customers. After 3 days kill losing ads and replace with variant of winners. If After that CPA is lower than your goal bump up the budget 4 times a day provided your CPA was good between bumps. Drop to original budget at the end of the day or if a bump fails.
[9.11.23, 16:49:58] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Do you put new winning creatives into a currently running adv+ Campaign or do you create Another?
[9.11.23, 16:50:11] ~ Robin: You put 10-50 ads in one Advantage+ campaign? Just curious to know
[9.11.23, 16:51:13] ~ L: That's interesting , I've heard a lot of people bumping the budget during the day - I guess it's worth testing this scaling strategy 

Thank you for sharing
[9.11.23, 16:56:03] ~ Farhat Godil: Thank you!
[9.11.23, 16:58:50] ~ L: When you start a new project, do you usually wait until the 500 Purchase event to run ADV+? 

I find that they work much better if you reach this threshold - just wondering if anyone is experiencing the same thing

[9.11.23, 17:58:12] ~ Ignasi: Campaigns are organized by products / offers / angles as long as they’re different enough
[9.11.23, 17:58:22] ~ Ignasi: Yes
[9.11.23, 17:58:44] ~ Ignasi: My pleasure
[9.11.23, 18:18:16] Matán Intsuper: If your roas is 3-4 why would u care if the be Roas is 1.9?
[9.11.23, 18:21:09] ~ Haroon: higher profit, more margin to scale
[9.11.23, 18:21:25] ~ Haroon: Do you sell to Germany? What’s your be ROAS on average? Just curious
[9.11.23, 18:46:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: when using microsoft clarity, do you install the custom code in funnel settings -> custom code -> Append to page head? 

And do i have to do anything with lazyload or delay? 

Or is this all wrong
[9.11.23, 18:46:53] Matán Intsuper: It’s correct and you can remove lazy load
[9.11.23, 18:47:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: great thanks
[9.11.23, 18:47:28] Matán Intsuper: If you want higher profit reduce your cogs or sell for higher price
[9.11.23, 19:58:49] ~ Farhat Godil: Do you turn off any ads on day to day basis where they have spent significant amount and haven’t gotten a sale? And turn them back on next day?
[9.11.23, 20:29:49] ~ Aashi: ‎~ Aashi joined using a group link.
[9.11.23, 20:08:33] ~ Kyle Twohill: Has anyone been experiencing really high cpcs on Facebook the past few days
[9.11.23, 20:15:18] Matán Intsuper: Q4 I guess
[9.11.23, 20:19:06] Carlos Leeseman: Are there big differences between personal or agency ad account?
[9.11.23, 20:32:44] ~ Rajat Grover: Hey, just a quick question - does anyone tried Stripe with Klarna VS Direct Klarna - does it effects CR rate? ‎<This message was edited>
[9.11.23, 20:37:40] ~ Mubasel: It didnt effect the cr rate for me, so I switched back to stripe, because they only transfer you money once every week and always keep some  money for security.
[9.11.23, 20:38:17] ~ Rajat Grover: Thanks for confirming!
[9.11.23, 21:14:40] ~ Ignasi: Not in our case. Once they’ve died they’ve died
[9.11.23, 21:26:51] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: How long does it take for your CS to answer all the mails everyday? I hired a guy this week and he took 7 hours to answer 120 emails😂
[9.11.23, 21:27:02] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: This is not cost effective for me😅
[9.11.23, 21:27:44] Carlos Leeseman: We do 30-50 mail in 1 hour
[9.11.23, 21:28:11] Carlos Leeseman: But really depense on the case.
[9.11.23, 21:29:32] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Yeah understand, will need to have a talk with him since it’s no brain science emails either
[9.11.23, 22:00:41] ~ Alex Noghreh: Hi Luka. Can you share with me as well ?
[9.11.23, 22:01:39] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Could you connect me aswell?🙏🏼
[9.11.23, 22:01:40] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Can you please share his info with me as well?
[9.11.23, 23:40:40] ~ Bryan T: Anyone have a workaround for tik tok shop product title issues? My main sku has a short title I do not want to have to change just for this platform
[10.11.23, 2:15:57] ~ Gedion: Is this like surf scaling?
[10.11.23, 4:56:44] ~ Kevin kreative: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ Love to watch Marek shared again

[10.11.23, 8:54:52] ~ Ignasi: Yes
[10.11.23, 10:30:03] Carlos Leeseman: Do you guys sometimes see big difference when you switch to other ad account? I have idea that performance on this account is very bad
[10.11.23, 10:31:51] ~ Anvar: quite often, yes
[10.11.23, 10:34:21] Carlos Leeseman: Hmm okay
[10.11.23, 10:39:19] Carlos Leeseman: I still use personal ad account. Maybe it’s better to switch to an agency account
[10.11.23, 10:40:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Didnt matter for me when i was general dropshipping
[10.11.23, 10:40:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Own ad account or agency same results
[10.11.23, 10:54:56] ~ Luka: Didn’t notice a difference either in terms of results. Nothing different compared to running on a new ad account
[10.11.23, 13:36:49] ~ RS: Hey! For those who use Funnelish+shopify - what profit tracking app do you use that shows correct data in USD even if funnelish generates orders in shopify in multiple currencies? I use truprofit and it worked well, but today again it crashed and it does not convert currencies to usd. If order comes for 200 NZD, it shows as 200 USD etc. They had this issue in July and they fixed it, but now again the same issue. Maybe there is another app that does not glitch over time?
[10.11.23, 13:49:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I use Polar and have 3 different currencies attached. it all gets calculated to EURO for me.
[10.11.23, 13:49:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: polar is quite expensive though but fully customizable to fit all your needs you want to track
[10.11.23, 13:50:18] ~ RS: Great Thanks. Will check it
[10.11.23, 13:50:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: this is their website: https://www.polaranalytics.com/
[10.11.23, 13:50:55] ~ RS: Thanks man!
[10.11.23, 15:01:41] ~ Robin: Hey guys, how much do you pay your video editor per hour and how many videos can they create? Per day or per week? ‎<This message was edited>
[10.11.23, 15:09:25] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, we are going online in Germany this week. I was wondering if it's best to run on the same ad account & page? Or a new page and ad account? Would love to hear your opinion/experience
[10.11.23, 16:55:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: did anybody splittest shopify checkout vs funnelish checkout? 

I think shopify checkout is more trusted because they recognize it, but funnelish checkout is more customizable with upsells and orderbumps.
[10.11.23, 16:56:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: let me know if shopify checkout can be a CVR boost
[10.11.23, 16:56:11] ~ Luka: Can split test by creating a shopify checkout but with added conversion elements
[10.11.23, 16:57:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: jeah i have a shopify store, and i saw i can just put the product in add to cart and copy the checkout link and link this to the sales page on funnelish
[10.11.23, 16:57:26] ~ Jeremy Leppink: but adding things to checkout is that even possible without shopify+?
[10.11.23, 16:59:19] ~ Luka: Should be able to recreate shopidy’s checkout on Fun slush. We’re going to do it on Woocommerce, Shopify checkout but optimized further. No clue how it’ll perform but I’d say worth a shot considering many are familiar with Shopify’s checkout
[10.11.23, 16:59:31] ~ Luka: Funnelish*
[10.11.23, 16:59:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: jeah thats true. i can make it pretty similar i think
[10.11.23, 17:00:03] ~ Jeremy Leppink: allright thanks, ill give it a shot
[10.11.23, 17:17:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: this does not work btw, i thought it did first but when i put the link in funnelish it will just send me to the shopify homepage
[10.11.23, 17:18:52] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Would like to know aswell
[10.11.23, 17:42:15] ~ Daniel: I pay them $1k/mo fix, and they only make VSLs. A 5 minute VSL takes 1 day, if it's longer then 2-3 days. They can do them faster, but I value quality more, so they make animations for each VSL, and spend more time on specific frames etc.
[10.11.23, 17:45:48] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Anyone have a freelance that can set up Zapier From facebook to Shopify
To send data faster?
[10.11.23, 17:58:52] ~ Robin: And that is if you source the content, or do they manage that to?
[10.11.23, 18:02:01] ~ Ecomcesar: Hello guys can anyone recommend a very good agency or freelancer who can make very good VSLs in English and Spanish? I would really appreciate 🙏
[10.11.23, 18:03:57] ~ Daniel: no I send them the video from the spokesperson on a greenscreen, and some UGC with the product, the rest is from stocks
[10.11.23, 18:20:40] ~ Ignasi: Hi all - what’s the best spy tool for ads and funnels right now? Beauty niche. Great thanks in advance 🙏🏻
[10.11.23, 18:46:59] ~ RS: Do you have issues with shopify admin now? Admin does not work on both of my stores
[10.11.23, 18:47:19] ~ L: Yes
[10.11.23, 18:47:20] ~ Allan L: Same here
[10.11.23, 18:47:41] ~ RS: Ok, now I see that they updated it in shopifystatus.com . They are aware of it
[10.11.23, 20:25:24] ~ Bryan T: Nothing worse than thinking your store is down only to realize it's a shopify issue 😅
‎[10.11.23, 20:53:50] Carlos Leeseman: ‎image omitted
[10.11.23, 20:58:40] Matán Intsuper: I have 500 ads rejected and no shadow ban
[10.11.23, 20:58:50] Matán Intsuper: So there’s probably not much u can do
[10.11.23, 21:05:20] ~ Marko: How do you check for shadow bans?
[10.11.23, 21:05:35] Carlos Leeseman: FB insider
[10.11.23, 21:15:10] ~ Marko: how did you get a fb insider?
[10.11.23, 21:15:35] ~ Allan L: My insider can check your full page for 300$
[10.11.23, 21:15:39] ~ Allan L: How much is yours Carlos?
[10.11.23, 21:15:55] ~ Allan L: Same with getting a competitioners ads manager screenshots etc, 350
[10.11.23, 21:16:45] Carlos Leeseman: Oh nice! Mine was $500
[10.11.23, 21:16:58] Carlos Leeseman: Oh really?!
[10.11.23, 21:17:06] Carlos Leeseman: That’s fk crazy haha
[10.11.23, 21:17:43] ~ L: That is crazy 🤣

Do you mind sharing the contact ?
[10.11.23, 21:18:21] ~ Allan L: Have had a long time relationship with mine as well, same with my google guy. Not really using him much latey tho
[10.11.23, 21:18:40] ~ Allan L: Sorry, for safety issues I dont share the direct contact. but I can help you if you need some services
[10.11.23, 21:19:49] ~ Maxi: Hey guys, anyone currently in Dubai and wants to meet up ? 

Will be in Dubai until 8th December
[10.11.23, 21:21:22] ~ L: It’s understandable don’t worry. 
I don’t need anything in particular now actually.

Do you have any advice on how to find an insider? Is an insider just someone from the customer care who you get in touch with using unmonitored channels?
[10.11.23, 21:22:09] ~ Allan L: Well, most of the time its from another contact or something. otherwise you can look at LinkedIn for the offices facebook outsoures their support to and just send a PM to everyone pretty much
[10.11.23, 21:22:57] ~ L: Will do, thank you for sharing Allan 👍🏻
[10.11.23, 21:40:17] ~ Bryan T: Hey guys, what are the obvious signs/metrics that your advertorial is dead? My performance is not good on mine anymore however the CTR for the advertorial page, sales page, and checkout CR are stable the whole time. My facebook CPC has gone up dramatically though on my ads the past few months. Is it possible this is advertorial fatigue or just bad fb ads
[10.11.23, 22:07:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I would say your fb ads are saturated and need a refresh
[10.11.23, 22:31:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Any good book recommendations (preferably audiobook) on how to do killer market research?
[10.11.23, 23:46:10] ~ Ecomcesar: Guys are you currently connecting your domain to your business manager? Or only running campaigns with your pixel without the API?
[10.11.23, 23:46:40] ~ Ecomcesar: since now you don't need to create and verify your events ?
[10.11.23, 23:46:55] ~ Ecomcesar: Should I connect my domain or not to Facebook?
[10.11.23, 23:47:13] ~ Ecomcesar: Highly appreciate your answers
[10.11.23, 23:47:15] ~ Ecomcesar: Thanks
[10.11.23, 23:47:18] ~ Ecomcesar: 🙏🙏🙂
[10.11.23, 23:47:51] Yaniv: if you use meta app on Shopify it should all do it automatically for you
[10.11.23, 23:48:01] ~ Ecomcesar: I use funnelish
[10.11.23, 23:48:42] Yaniv: Then you need to place it manually in the settings of funnelish funnel. you have API section there, yeah it does help a lot, also make sure to track add to cart as an event.
[10.11.23, 23:49:12] ~ Malik: Hey guys anyone here is great at Market research ? I have a product that made me 500k and sales are coming down at the moment. I don't think my product is dead yet. I have a few angles ideas but I haven't really done anything to know my idéal customers. Thank you in advance
[10.11.23, 23:49:40] ~ Ecomcesar: Ok so recommend to connecting domain with Facebook and use the API tracking in funnelish with the token right?
[10.11.23, 23:50:08] Yaniv: Yes it helps a lot
[10.11.23, 23:52:55] ~ RS: I have an email flow sending emails after 20 minutes of purchase, asking a few questions like why did you buy our product, what are your expectations, age etc. Based on the answers, I was able to create 2-3 angles and 1 of this Angle have made almost 300k in 2,5 months
[11.11.23, 1:49:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Good idea, thanks!
[11.11.23, 7:04:01] ~ lengjoo: yo guys, anyone has a solution for this?

customers are emailing our admin email used for PayPal instead of our customer email, we've already set up customer support email on PayPal, but they're still emailing the admin email lol
[11.11.23, 7:14:44] ~ Robert Gonzalez: lol no, i have the customer support’s email everywhere on my website so they dont go anywhere else
[11.11.23, 7:15:51] ~ Kevin kreative: 1. Just setup autofilter and fwd to your customer email or

2. Setup primary email as CS email
[11.11.23, 7:15:59] ~ Kevin kreative: You can change the email later
[11.11.23, 7:18:54] Yaniv: On big scale some will still reach out from PayPal.
[11.11.23, 7:19:10] Yaniv: Very small % tho but it does happen to me as well
[11.11.23, 9:22:10] ~ Bilel: Hey guys, are Instagram CPMs usually higher than FB CPMs or it's just us?
[11.11.23, 9:24:28] ~ Bilel: Could it be Q4 competition?
[11.11.23, 10:02:09] ~ G M: Guys when you have multiple PayPal accounts, and you need multiple phone numbers, what sims do you use? Do you use eSIMs?
[11.11.23, 10:08:22] ~ busy: skype phone number
[11.11.23, 10:08:53] ~ busy: https://secure.skype.com/it/skype-number
[11.11.23, 10:39:51] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, with GEO funnels, do you use the same URL or do you still give it a separate URL? I hear from some that 10-15% of traffic uses a VPN, so GEO funnels don't always work well
[11.11.23, 12:11:02] ~ Nim: Same url, just set the right country code on it at the funnel level
[11.11.23, 12:38:07] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For anyone who is getting stuck on what a good upsell could be for your product, what angles to use or how to talk to your audience, i just got into this and this is helping me a ton: 

- Dive into reddit, crazy value to do very good market research and see what people like and dont like
- Look through comments on books related to your product/problem you are solving, you can see all the fears/obstacles they have and whats holding them back
[11.11.23, 13:35:28] ~ Santi Roa: Surveys and call customers. Spend a few hours speaking with them!
[11.11.23, 14:20:31] ~ Mohammed-amine: Guys, what tool do you use to generate TikTok-style voiceovers? I'm looking for the exact female voice tiktok uses
[11.11.23, 14:21:07] ~ Luka: https://weilbyte.github.io/tiktok-tts/

[11.11.23, 15:59:44] ~ RS: Guys who run 3-5min VSLs, what is your average CPC to USA or big4 ?
[11.11.23, 20:05:52] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Hey @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ can i get access to the "campaigns for recommendation"? When I clicked on each link it asks me to request access
[12.11.23, 1:10:09] ~ Robert Gonzalez: 🥹

[12.11.23, 18:22:10] ~ Haroon: A friend asks this : 

Basically TikTok shop launched a new feature where people can create shops like amazon and then find creators collaborate and make the whole biz through tiktok. This is available only in UK, US, and hongkong and i am looking for a solution to rent a company or buy a TT shop because also i dont want to register a company now in USA
[12.11.23, 18:22:12] ~ Haroon: Someone available ?

Found a few but trying to gather as much information as possible
[13.11.23, 8:12:29] ~ ARTURS: I can connect you, DM me
[13.11.23, 12:49:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: With the new EU regulations that people now can pay to not see ads in instagram/fb for €12 a month, did this have any impact on the guys here running in EU?
[13.11.23, 12:51:05] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Wouldn’t say that I have seen big change
[13.11.23, 12:52:44] ~ L: My idea is that only a very small percentage of people will be willing to pay for that. Additionally, those who pay €12 monthly to avoid ads are the same people who are so annoyed and irritated by the ads that they wouldn't have bought either way
[13.11.23, 12:53:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Solid point 😅 didnt even think of it that way
[13.11.23, 12:54:39] ~ Allan L: What company structure/formation is the best for selling in UK? Want to avoid paying as much taxes and vat as possible, while still having a easy paypal

Was thinking about a Wyoming LLC, but not sure if getting paypal is easy there, previously had a US llc where I could't due to itin being delayed forever ‎<This message was edited>

[13.11.23, 23:04:44] ~ RS: Nono of my stores work 😀
[13.11.23, 23:05:04] ~ RS: None*
[13.11.23, 23:05:15] ~ RS: At least funnelish works 😀
[13.11.23, 23:05:18] ~ Julien: my shops are down too :/
[13.11.23, 23:05:30] ~ Ignasi: Checkout , cart and API are working. The storefront is down. Any of you sending traffic straight to cart or checkout or using the API are safe
[13.11.23, 23:07:29] ~ Ignasi: Mine are back 100% now
[13.11.23, 23:07:54] ~ Tim Alleraun: Same
[13.11.23, 23:08:48] ~ Julien: same
[13.11.23, 23:08:51] ~ Julien: just now
[13.11.23, 23:11:11] ~ Tarlan: I use Funnelish and it’s working fine. Everything is okay with connected Shopify too. 

I use agency account and seems like the issue is on their side.
[14.11.23, 0:07:47] Bob: Did anyone get this error that they can’t run ads anymore because they have a subscription. I don’t have a subscription, but for some reason I have this warning and can launch new ads
[14.11.23, 0:15:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I heard this a few times now
[14.11.23, 0:16:11] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Fb support says its a bug
[14.11.23, 0:16:36] Bob: That’s weird, but what I thought as well
[14.11.23, 1:32:02] ~ Memed: Hey guys, so our paged got banned with a 4.4 feedback score , we would really appreciate if anyone could share us a insider to get it back. Thanks in advance : )
[14.11.23, 1:52:55] ~ Kyle Twohill: Do you guys see good results with adv+ audience?
[14.11.23, 1:52:59] ~ Kyle Twohill: On fb
[14.11.23, 2:02:10] ~ Kyle Twohill: And adv+ creative with the automatic optimizations? Or does it do worse usually

[14.11.23, 6:01:49] ~ Robert Gonzalez: @⁨~ARTURS⁩ ?😅
[14.11.23, 6:46:37] ~ ARTURS: @⁨~Robert Gonzalez⁩ Hey Robert - thanks for patience. Please see DM.
[14.11.23, 6:59:35] ~ Rajat Grover: In the same way, I was able to see that the personal address you have registered on your Stripe account is an Indian address instead of a US address. Please make sure to provide a valid US address in order for us to verify it.
[14.11.23, 6:59:45] ~ Rajat Grover: Stripe verification issue!
[14.11.23, 7:00:20] ~ Rajat Grover: Did anyone had similar issue?
[14.11.23, 12:16:18] ~ Marko: Microsoft clarity/lucky orange/hotjar?
[14.11.23, 12:16:32] ~ Marko: Curious which one is best
[14.11.23, 12:16:54] ~ Bilel: My opinion is clarity
[14.11.23, 12:17:00] ~ Luka: Personally prefer Microsoft Clairty. Free & easy to use
[14.11.23, 12:17:11] ~ Bilel: Cleaner looking UI
[14.11.23, 12:43:08] ~ Bilel: What platforms give credit cards with good cashback rate for non US residents without SSN?
[14.11.23, 12:57:03] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Guys anyone's having problems with geolocation since the Shopify crash of yesterday?
[14.11.23, 12:57:51] ~ Alessandro Sassi: It stopped working on my store, it's showing EUR to everyone regarding of the visitor location
[14.11.23, 13:02:44] ~ Y: FullStory if you can afford it, it’s the best in the market, especially for eCommerce and complex funnels… not affiliated.
[14.11.23, 13:04:30] ~ Luka: There is a newer one https://heatmap.com/ it chas an interesting feature... it tracks how much revenue certain clicks bring. 

For example if you have a video on your LP... maybe people who click on the video are 2x more likely to convert. Now you know the video is really effective and can improve its placement
[14.11.23, 13:04:44] ~ Luka: I haven't tried it at all, just remember seeing a Twitter thread about it
[14.11.23, 13:45:36] ~ Mohammed-amine: ‎This message was deleted.
[14.11.23, 13:46:33] ~ Mohammed-amine: Mercury 1% and Airwallex 1.5%
[14.11.23, 13:46:55] ~ Mohammed-amine: Hey guys, for those who moved to Dubai, which service do you recommend that handles the whole process from A-Z? (incoporating, visa, bank accounts etc)
[14.11.23, 14:33:09] ~ lengjoo: isn't mercury 1.5%? we have 1.5
[14.11.23, 14:33:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: from where are you moving?
[14.11.23, 14:33:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i just got everything done
[14.11.23, 14:35:22] ~ Bilel: I was wondering if anyone has another solution with higher rates. There's dash.fi which offers 3% but require SSN
[14.11.23, 14:36:08] ~ lengjoo: damn 3% unlimited?
[14.11.23, 14:36:18] ~ Bilel: Yep!
[14.11.23, 14:39:06] ~ Bilel: If you have someone in US who can sign for you then it would be great
[14.11.23, 14:40:09] ~ lengjoo: seems like there’s a catch “Up to 3% cash back on your first 2 months of spend”
[14.11.23, 14:40:25] ~ Mohammed-amine: Morocco
[14.11.23, 14:40:29] ~ Santi Roa: Yeah all the marketing on that website sounds unprofessional
[14.11.23, 14:40:43] ~ Santi Roa: I just submitted a demo, and it asked "do you have more than 100k in your bank"
[14.11.23, 14:40:52] ~ Santi Roa: which is weird, I never got asked such a question
[14.11.23, 14:41:22] ~ Bilel: I think it's normal. Brex asked the same question
[14.11.23, 14:41:31] ~ lengjoo: Bank of America 2.62%
[14.11.23, 14:41:45] ~ Mohammed-amine: I have noticed that facebook ads performance goes down when I use credit card with cash back as payment method, so I stick with debit. Anyone noticed the same?
‎[14.11.23, 14:52:45] ~ Maxi: ‎image omitted
[14.11.23, 14:55:17] ~ Tim Alleraun: We have increase with CNE aswell
[14.11.23, 14:56:11] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ok, the company that arranged everything for me is currently only doing it for the Netherlands.
[14.11.23, 15:14:15] ~ Mohammed-amine: I got you
[14.11.23, 15:14:16] ~ Mohammed-amine: yes
[14.11.23, 15:15:53] ~ lengjoo: not using yunexpress but generally ours also increased
[14.11.23, 15:32:07] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Is it a good idea to start launching black friday/ week ads right now? Seen a few people do it.
[14.11.23, 15:38:39] ~ Bilel: Received the same
[14.11.23, 16:17:34] ~ Sang: due to war actually, my supplier even think about buy more real gold lol. P/S : https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-risks-from-great-power-conflicts
[14.11.23, 16:49:43] ~ Mohammed-amine: Does anyone got a Transferwise contact? been banned for 4 years for no reason
[14.11.23, 16:54:37] ~ Haroon: Bro i had the same issue
[14.11.23, 16:55:03] ~ Haroon: You have to disconnect your IG account then it will work, I contacted Facebook because I already checked the subscription and it is a bug
[14.11.23, 17:42:12] ~ Daniel: hey guys, I tried targeting worldwide for my product, and it works better than if I target US only, or T4 only, my CR is a lot lower ofc, but the ROAS is higher. Is there any downside if I switch to targeting worldwide on all my adsets?
[14.11.23, 17:57:24] ~ L: Did you noticed new countries been targeted profitably ? 

Or all the sales are coming from the same countries, but with a better roas?
[14.11.23, 17:58:15] ~ Daniel: it's new countries targeted profitably
[14.11.23, 18:15:48] Bob: Yeah I fixed it, all works now!
[14.11.23, 18:15:56] Bob: Thanks though man
[14.11.23, 18:16:03] ~ Haroon: How did you do it?
[14.11.23, 18:16:12] ~ Haroon: Because I want to connect my ig back if u have a solution
[14.11.23, 18:18:30] ~ L: It looks like you found new countries, I would make a new CBO campaign for each country
[14.11.23, 18:24:29] ~ Dr Tim: Hey guys I'm new here. My name is Prince Tim, Nigerian, live in the UK. Have some previous experience but not anywhere near enough. Looking forward to learn and help others as well.

This community is great and I'm glad to be a part. Some of the nuggets being shared is mind boggling.

TO 7 figures and beyond!!

Thank you @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ for putting together such an amazing community and resource.

Now the hard part of growth begins for me. Thank you!
[14.11.23, 18:25:11] ~ David B: Welcome!
[14.11.23, 18:25:12] Matán Intsuper: Welcome!
[14.11.23, 18:26:22] ~ Dr Tim: The man from South London! Thank you.
[14.11.23, 18:26:28] ~ Dr Tim: Thank you
[14.11.23, 18:27:33] ~ Marko: Hey everyone, we are considering starting making some VSL’s for ecom store owners. Before doing this we’re just curious to find out how many people would be interested in a service like that in a group like this to see if it’s even worth it. If you could see yourself potentially interested, thumps up this message so I can get a rough idea. ‎<This message was edited>
[14.11.23, 18:29:36] Bob: I just went into my account settings and reselcted that I want it for free. It gave me some errors at first, but eventually I was able to do it and then it just worked again for me. So I never disconnected my ig
[14.11.23, 18:30:22] ~ Haroon: Damn I did that too I’m the beginning, how often you repeated this so it works? Or is it time depended when you do once
[14.11.23, 18:31:14] Bob: I did it once on fb and like 3 times on ig. And then it didn’t work straight away. So when I went back in like 5 hours later it worked
[14.11.23, 18:31:32] ~ Haroon: Great to know thx
[14.11.23, 19:03:24] Carlos Leeseman: With GEO funnels, do you still use a separate domain or the same one? Heard from some that people use a VPN and therefore get on the wrong language....
[14.11.23, 19:28:51] ~ Tarlan: With GEO funnels you need to have same domain and page paths. Otherwise it doesnt really work. 

In case if you prefer using separate domains, you need to copy or create an other funnel.
[14.11.23, 22:34:19] ~ David: Anyone here using airwallex with Shopify?
[15.11.23, 10:43:23] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: For people Who are set up a call center

We're going to set this up, and I'd love to hear about the mistakes you've made and what's working well for you.


For our part, we're also going to call up cart abandonment with a well-oiled script
[15.11.23, 10:46:42] ~ G M: At what volume of revenue/sales per month do you think it is useful to think about a call center?
[15.11.23, 11:34:08] ~ Santi Roa: I am also planning to do it, I spoke with a few friends and they all advised me to NOT do it inhouse. Just hire a call center to handle your calls
[15.11.23, 11:34:40] ~ Santi Roa: I messaged some, haven't made any decision yet.

Are you planning to build it internally in your team?
[15.11.23, 11:46:08] ~ Maxi: I think it also depends on the product.

If it’s a consumable you might consider a call center already at 200-300k monthly
[15.11.23, 12:02:42] ~ Santi Roa: Do you use a call center? Can you give us some stats of the impact it had on your rev
[15.11.23, 12:03:04] ~ Santi Roa: Currently doing 1.5m and we don't have a call center yet
[15.11.23, 12:03:22] ~ Maxi: No i don’t use but I planned via checkoutchamp to try it out
[15.11.23, 12:03:44] ~ Maxi: They have a whole CRM section and customers can be billed by the click of a button after call etc
[15.11.23, 12:04:13] ~ Maxi: Pretty nice.. but also expensive 1% of revenue / month so I’ll try it only and see if it really increases profit and revenue after their 1% cut
[15.11.23, 12:21:20] ~ Robin: Is anyone else seeing a large decrease in their target groups? Fb says it's because of the new payment service. My target groups have decreased by 50-70%.
[15.11.23, 13:04:09] ~ Rajat Grover: Facing issue with Stripe verification now => They need an ID Proof for owner and while I'm entering my own Indian details and my own bank statements etc as proof but they are not accepting

for US Stripe => They are asking for US ID proof
for UK Stripe => They have rejected mine Indian Address Proof ( Passport, driving license ) => Bank account I have just submitted now

( I have 2 companies 1 in US and 1 in UK so trying to applying from both on different emails )
[15.11.23, 13:25:50] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Does anyone have a solution for the 3 week hold on PayPal? My Cashflow is fucked on all angles🤣
[15.11.23, 13:30:29] ~ RS: I had that for 4 months. And every month i was able to withdraw only 900eur instantly😀 after that every transaction in hold for 21 days or until package is delivered. I then contacted PayPal, asked to increase withdraw limit to 10k, then accepted and ser limit to 14k and released 14k out of 19k of my hold instantly 😀 and now I can access all the funds from all new transactions even though PayPal sent me email that now every transaction will go to hold again😀
[15.11.23, 13:30:55] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone here dropshipping with funnels doing some good numbers? I would love to spar a little
[15.11.23, 13:31:53] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Okey nice, did you Contact the support or did you just click the "I want to increase my limit" button? Because that didnt work for me. Maybe is should ask the support? :)
[15.11.23, 13:35:35] ~ Daniel Lai: the button never works, the whole page is completely glitched they say they’ll respond in 3 business days but never do.  Mine is at like 30k withdrawal a month after a few months of using that paypal account, all I do is use an automatic tracking number sync and keep revenue coming through paypal
[15.11.23, 13:42:51] ~ Santi Roa: How much volume sre you doing? Is it dropshipping?
[15.11.23, 13:43:39] ~ Santi Roa: I have an enterprise paypal plug, for more than 1m/yr. It can be even less but the level of attention might be less
[15.11.23, 13:44:48] ~ Santi Roa: They do PayPal + Braintree. Is like getting to paypal from the backdoor.

I was banned lifetime and he opened my account now, did 400k first month through paypal and 0 issues no holds nothing. This is because they underwrited my account before
[15.11.23, 13:45:10] ~ Santi Roa: They are from the US though I don't know if my guy can help with other countries
[15.11.23, 13:46:23] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I am doing dropshipping, but paypal is where the least amount is at. I currently have about $180,000-190,000 in TOTAL that is on hold and stuck which in my case is making it very hard to scale and maintain😅 Especially now closing in on BFCM.
[15.11.23, 13:52:29] ~ Santi Roa: Is not someone that charge for doing it. Is a legit paypal rep that work to onboard enterprise clients
[15.11.23, 13:52:49] ~ Santi Roa: So he will not charge anything. I will not make anything from the connection of course
[15.11.23, 13:53:38] ~ lengjoo: does he help with holds 😂
[15.11.23, 13:53:39] ~ lengjoo: for free
[15.11.23, 13:54:15] ~ Santi Roa: I don't think he help with holds in that sense. He can onboard anyone on an enterprisr account, do the underwriting and set you free of holds forever
[15.11.23, 13:54:23] ~ Santi Roa: But I think they do not accept dropshipping
[15.11.23, 13:55:03] ~ G M: So you must have warehouse in USc
[15.11.23, 13:55:04] ~ G M: ?
[15.11.23, 13:57:57] ~ Daniel Lai: if there are any devs in here, you should really make an app which automatically converts yunexpress tracking numbers to the last mile tracking number and updates it on shopify, I’m sure a lot of dropshippers would use
[15.11.23, 13:59:40] ~ Santi Roa: Not sure but I think so. Or at least look like a brand
[15.11.23, 14:04:46] ~ RS: I contacted them in message center. “I want to increase limit” Also never worked for me. Always declined or showed error
[15.11.23, 14:07:05] ~ lengjoo: if we alrd have an acc, can we open a enterprise one?
[15.11.23, 14:07:09] ~ lengjoo: wil dm you
[15.11.23, 14:40:51] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: What contact do you have?
We have built a process for especially convert people in buyer
[15.11.23, 14:43:01] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Of whole revenue or The revenue they generate?

[15.11.23, 17:26:26] ~ Luka: Where do you live?
[15.11.23, 18:08:06] ~ Rajat Grover: For Klarna - Can you suggest where I can get these from? - I don't have a supplier agreement - can we get it from CJ or any dropshipping website if yes please suggest?

 Can you please elaborate on your business concept by answering the following questions:


Please provide 2-3 suppliers' invoices
OR or a dropshipping agreement signed by both you and the supplier. 
Provide a link to the supplier's website or online store.
[15.11.23, 18:25:56] ~ Marko: Does anyone have a stripe phone number or an insider contact? 2 step authentication is not working for stripe for some reason so i cannot login now
[15.11.23, 20:20:31] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey guys! Some of you have reached out for new payment providers…And the tip we always give: when evaluating providers, it’s important to think like an underwriter to get the best terms and rates.

With larger payment organizations tightening their risk criteria, this can mean increased reserves, funding holds or account closures as you start to scale your business.

Learn how to be proactive and prevent some of these roadblocks from happening by learning what things on your site are evaluated by risk teams / underwriters on today’s payments call. See you there!

[16.11.23, 1:05:00] ~ Dr Tim: Thank you
[16.11.23, 1:05:38] ~ Dr Tim: I used jumpstart to get my LLC and they were able to sort out ITIN I believe.
[16.11.23, 1:06:04] ~ Dr Tim: Also used Wyomingagents and both had no issues getting ITIN for the LLC
[16.11.23, 1:06:23] ~ Allan L: Do you remember How fast and are your a US resident your self?
[16.11.23, 1:06:46] ~ Dr Tim: UK resident. Nigerian passport holder.
[16.11.23, 1:06:52] ~ Allan L: So you had no issues getting a PayPal with The new companies?
[16.11.23, 1:07:38] ~ Dr Tim: Can't remember how long but maybe 21 days or less. No PayPal yet. I'm just now going to open PayPal in the UK.

Hated the service before lol and its my first time selling in this market.
[16.11.23, 1:09:17] ~ Allan L: Arh okay. I sell in UK and like 20% is PayPal for me. So really dont want to not having PayPal, But Yea. Guess i just have to get The company formed and let The time pass
[16.11.23, 1:09:42] ~ Dr Tim: Forming a Company here is a breeze
[16.11.23, 1:10:18] ~ Allan L: Yea But dont want The company in UK when thats my main market. Doesnt give any tax Venedigs
[16.11.23, 1:10:21] ~ Allan L: Venedigs
[16.11.23, 1:10:36] ~ Allan L: Auto correct, almost a sleep. Benefits
[16.11.23, 1:10:37] ~ Dr Tim: I used qualityformations.co.uk

I'm not endorsing them neither am I an affiliate
[16.11.23, 1:11:37] ~ Allan L: Thanks for The tips tho! Gotta get some sleep. 🙌
[16.11.23, 1:12:01] ~ Dr Tim: Good for you. I'm about to launch my campaign for the UK market.

How's your cpm/CPA compared to US and Europe? Any tips?
[16.11.23, 1:26:16] ~ Robert Gonzalez: hey guys, how many sales are you doing? I need some motivation hehe :P
[16.11.23, 1:26:40] ~ Robert Gonzalez: i'm doing around $6k daily, can't seem to go past the $10k 🥲
[16.11.23, 4:07:43] ~ Bilel: Many here are doing more than 8 fig years. So more than 30k/day. Some are even doing 100-500k/days. Sky is the limit!
[16.11.23, 4:11:54] ~ Robert Gonzalez: That’s awesome! Can’t wait to start hitting those numbers!
‎[16.11.23, 4:12:20] ~ Thomas Tran: ‎image omitted
[16.11.23, 4:45:44] ~ Bryan T: Been at 3-5k for 3 years I hear you lol
[16.11.23, 4:47:40] ~ Dr Tim: I'm curious, is there a reason why? Comfortable at this level? It's solid 6 figures a month for sure or there are some bottlenecks?
[16.11.23, 4:50:54] ~ Bryan T: Mostly lack of knowledge/next steps imo, we got to this level really quickly but didn't understand how to build the proper systems/products to get us to the next level. ESS has been a blessing for understanding this and being able to ask for help in tons of different areas
[16.11.23, 4:52:58] Alex  Fedotoff: More to come! 🚀
[16.11.23, 4:53:56] ~ Dr Tim: Awesome!
[16.11.23, 5:04:21] ~ Mike Ramsey: Agree!

Can’t build an empire in a day - take those steps / wins as success.  

There’s a lot of people sitting on their ass wishing they could do what you’re doing, (but no action) so just keep good perspective.  

As a third party and observing, you have a TON of resources around you to help you kill it, so ask those questions and always be a student.  Results will come 📈 ‎<This message was edited>
[16.11.23, 5:37:04] ~ Bryan T: Golden perspective, I sometimes catch myself thinking all of this is typical or fall into the "everybody is doing it" mentality and it just couldn't be farther from the truth
[16.11.23, 5:39:22] ~ Bilel: Don't compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, last week, last month, last year... Each one of us had a different starting point. Comparing oneself to others is a recipe for unhappiness and lack of fulfillment.
[16.11.23, 5:40:20] ~ Bilel: Looking at what others are doing can be a great inspiration though when you acknowledge the above! ‎<This message was edited>
[16.11.23, 6:21:04] ~ busy: 100% agree and would also add that the ultimate goal for anyone should be to play your own game in life without needing any external validation
[16.11.23, 7:52:07] ~ Denys: Does any one have a contact number to Wise UK?
[16.11.23, 7:54:04] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Anyways, it’s awesome to be surrounded by a lot of people who’s doing better than you, if you hace the right mindset, that pushes you to be better

Like they say, if you surround with millionaires, you’ll become the next one🙌

Glad to be in this group!
[16.11.23, 8:04:56] ~ Maxi: Well of whole revenue that is being processed using their platform / checkout
[16.11.23, 8:08:34] ~ Tarlan: If you mean what number to use to create UK Wise account, you can use Callhippo
[16.11.23, 8:12:34] ~ Denys: No I need a number to contact them, they are holding all my payouts since last Friday and asking for documents "business's Shopify payment report for the last 3-6 months" whatever I upload they are asking to reupload
[16.11.23, 8:13:39] ~ Rajat Grover: I can help, DM me
[16.11.23, 10:58:04] ~ Marko: Hey everyone, we are in an extreme high pressure situation business wise. We have to make something work in the next 2-3 weeks or we are screwed. We were one of the first movers with the product we are selling currently but now there are many competitors and we can’t seem to make anything work.

Curious if there are any people that are able to get products to 5-10k days in 2-3 weeks.

Any advice is appreciated.

[16.11.23, 11:30:16] Carlos Leeseman: Total spend €300 now on this funnel
[16.11.23, 11:38:18] ~ David B: If the conversion rate is low, trust is low or the offer is wrong. You can try split testing different price points, by doing average marketing. (Find all your competitors and average the price point based on their positioning.) 

Increasing social proof. (Aim for high quality social proof EG video testimonials go and ask a bunch of people you know who fit the demographic to film a 30 second video.)
[16.11.23, 11:43:50] ~ Santi Roa: We got pur product from 10k to 60k a day in 3 weeks. It was just the right combination of great creatives, good media buying strategy, CRO, and improvements all over the place
[16.11.23, 11:44:59] ~ Santi Roa: But we've been pushing limits for months like someone said before, doing under 15k/day and pushing until we improved to be able to do  30k/day, then 40k, and so on
[16.11.23, 11:47:10] ~ Santi Roa: We all been through that. There's always been those invisible limits. I think it's all based on:
"What level are you currently operating?"

If you are executing like a 200k/month brand, chances are you will be making 200k a month.

If you start executing like a 1m/month brand, then you will get there
[16.11.23, 11:47:29] ~ Marko: Ah yeah in our case it’s not  about optimising something that is working to bigger numbers. We need to get something from very unprofitable to profitable.
[16.11.23, 11:49:20] ~ Santi Roa: At the beginning of this year we had a tough quarter, losses and back to selling under 15k day... and I asked myself this question. And yes, we were aiming to do 1m/month consistently... but we were operating like a 500k/month brand

Now we have changed, and we are doing 60k/day,  pushing for more.
It took a couple of months to impact though, but it happens if you keep executing on that level ‎<This message was edited>
[16.11.23, 11:57:05] ~ L: Those are crazy numbers to me man😅 
Congrats!

Please give us some advices on what you mainly focus when building a 60k/day business, that’d be mind blowing
[16.11.23, 11:58:36] ~ Santi Roa: What changed my perspective was sitting down, do research and see what DTC brands doing 100m/yr were doing. Analyze.
How many skus? Branded? Categories? Advertisements? Geos? UX? Offer?
[16.11.23, 12:02:11] ~ Santi Roa: Based on that, I understood that I was still behaving as a dropshipper in many senses. Still looking like a dropshipping brand, and there's no dropshipping brand that do 100m a year so I just planned ahead what needed to change and started working on it.

It takes time, I've been trying to scale for years of course. I joined ESS 2 years ago and were doing 3k/day at the time
Then scaled up to 10k day, then 15k, then 30k, and so on.

At the same time I built a team, developed a custom product, learned a lot.

I'm not really special for doing those numbers I just put the work on the next level and tried to execute at that level. Then results came
[16.11.23, 12:03:10] ~ Rajat Grover: That’s Amazing Brother
[16.11.23, 12:08:02] ~ L: That’s really interesting and helpful man, thank you. 

I’ve also joined the program doing 3k/day. And I’m now aiming to 10k day.

Did the process that took you from 3k to 10k per day lead you to 60k?

What shifted that brought you from from 3 to 10/20 ? ‎<This message was edited>
[16.11.23, 12:11:12] ~ Santi Roa: Good question, I think the program brought me to 30k/day. Then, the connections with people here and other people I met at the time in the ESS helped a lot to keep going.

And of course, I kept investing in higher level mentorships. I have local mentors, I joined Vistage, I read 2 books a month, idk those things slowly push you to higher levels.
[16.11.23, 12:17:30] ~ L: That’s great! 
A lot to work on.
Thank you for sharing
[16.11.23, 12:23:17] ~ lengjoo: g
[16.11.23, 13:31:50] ~ Alessandro Sassi: How long did it take you to have the ITIN approved? I would like to open an LLC in US and need PayPal
[16.11.23, 13:32:18] ~ Dr Tim: Few weeks. Can't remember. But it wasn't long at all
[16.11.23, 13:32:57] ~ Alessandro Sassi: oh nice thank you! Because they've told me you need like 7-10 weeks and sometimes there are delays
[16.11.23, 13:37:26] ~ Dr Tim: General guidance, yeah. Was much faster.
[16.11.23, 13:41:55] ~ Dr Tim: Guys running in the UK/US/EU market, how competitive is UK market compared to US for instance?
[16.11.23, 13:44:17] ~ David B: UK market is very similar in terms of buying intention but has a significantly smaller population of 60m compared with over 300m plus in the US. 

There is also a cost of living crisis in the UK with bills going through the roof reducing consumer spending power.
[16.11.23, 13:45:36] ~ Alessandro Sassi: In terms of CPMs I have around 25 eur in UK at the moment
[16.11.23, 13:50:39] ~ Dr Tim: Is that high or low relative to Europe?
[16.11.23, 13:51:12] ~ Alessandro Sassi: higher, EU countries I have 10-15
[16.11.23, 13:53:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 25 is pretty expensive right, isnt that what you also get in US?
[16.11.23, 13:53:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: maybe a little higher there
[16.11.23, 13:53:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: in dutch market after some optimalisation i get around 7-8
[16.11.23, 13:59:36] ~ Alessandro Sassi: it increased a lot in q4, q3 was like 15 max cpm in UK
[16.11.23, 13:59:57] ~ Nicco: everything depends on the niche and angles, we have 40/45$ in us
[16.11.23, 14:03:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: makes sense
[16.11.23, 14:05:32] ~ Dr Tim: Damn!!
[16.11.23, 14:05:59] ~ Dr Tim: 10-15 seems super good to me.
[16.11.23, 14:40:20] ~ RS: Is funnelish working good for you today? I have very many optins with Full address, name etc, but without sales. Conversion rate dropped a lot also.

And now one customer messaged me that she could not enter her card details in the payment field. 

Have you seen such problems with funnelish? 

In one webinar I hard that Harvey told that often his CR drops in funnelish because funnelish has some glitches some days. And he needs to use VPN to check every geo funnel. What exactly glitches for your stores? Sometimes I see that people from other geo funnels see checkout from another Geo funnel. For example, customer from the UK sees USA checkout etc.
‎[16.11.23, 14:44:33] ~ Tim Alleraun: ‎image omitted
[16.11.23, 14:45:47] ~ Peter: Seems legit
[16.11.23, 14:48:24] ~ Tim Alleraun: I am little cautios bc I did not get any notification inside the paypal account - only via email
[16.11.23, 14:48:51] ~ Farhat Godil: Yes I got the same thing as well only via email last year
[16.11.23, 14:50:03] ~ Tim Alleraun: Awesome, thanks for sharing! How long did the whole process take? Everything went well?
[16.11.23, 14:52:19] ~ Farhat Godil: It took about 2 weeks they wanted me to me send them P&L sheets etc I was like it’s Q4 I don’t have time for this and they settled on me sending them the tax statements for 2 yrs and provide trackings for missing trackings etc

So lot of back n forth but they did put 10% reserve on funds
[16.11.23, 14:52:41] Bob: Do you have any failed payments? Our cvr also dropped, but I don’t see any failed payments and haven’t gotten any emails about anything not working either.
[16.11.23, 14:53:23] ~ Tim Alleraun: Good to know - again, thanks for sharing. I already have a reserve, let's hope it does not get worse after that...
[16.11.23, 14:54:15] ~ Farhat Godil: Yes hopefully 🤞
[16.11.23, 16:41:13] ~ RS: Only a few failed. But there are many optins containing all customer information and address.
[16.11.23, 16:53:53] Bob: That is very weird man. I have this issue sometimes as well though that nobody just can pay for a little while and then it works again
[16.11.23, 16:55:27] ~ RS: Yeah, one lady messaged me that she cannot enter her card number. Dont know why. Then it fixes itself (funnelish). And funnelish support just reads messages without answering or trying to help
[16.11.23, 16:58:55] ~ G M: ‎This message was deleted.
[16.11.23, 16:59:11] Bob: Yeah I have the exact same sometimes. It’s really weird
[16.11.23, 17:16:28] ~ lengjoo: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[16.11.23, 18:58:25] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Same should work given that target audience uses same payment methods and you are trying to launch it on same store
[16.11.23, 19:01:26] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Mostly they send you email to discuss this when you are doing consistent numbers
[16.11.23, 19:01:33] ~ Bony Ghadiya: UK less completion, faster and cheaper shipping, less payment processors headache 

UK shipping from china would be significantly less than US - royal mail is quite efficient
[16.11.23, 19:05:24] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Took me 3 months for ITIN

Non-us resident 

LLC opening around a month - easy one tbh

EIN important until you get ITIN
[16.11.23, 19:05:25] ~ Bony Ghadiya: 3 and half*
[16.11.23, 19:08:49] ~ Alessandro Sassi: damn that's a lot.. thanks for sharing btw
[16.11.23, 19:10:53] ~ Dr Tim: UK CPMs seems waaay higher compared to the rest of Europe from all indications. That can have significant impact on CPA for sure.
[16.11.23, 19:19:22] ~ JK: On my way.
[16.11.23, 19:21:10] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Inevitable buffer period sir

Sooner you start, sooner you get
[16.11.23, 19:22:58] ~ Mike Ramsey: I’ve heard this will get faster in 2024 with certain aspects of the process getting streamlined.   But being the US government and their track record, I doubt it 😂
[16.11.23, 19:26:04] ~ Marko: I applied for ITIN and all the US stuff in the past, but today I was thinking: why is it actually needed? Can’t you just use european company to sell to the US and use eu ppal and stripe?
‎[16.11.23, 19:26:08] ~ Peter: ‎image omitted
[16.11.23, 19:27:18] ~ Allan L: What is The AOV of customers abandoning? Do you offer The proper payment methods? Is your shipping set up correct?
[16.11.23, 19:28:21] ~ Peter: Aov is like 23 usd and everything is set up correctly
[16.11.23, 19:28:44] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Can you do free shipping?
[16.11.23, 19:29:09] ~ Allan L: Looks like you try to sell in germany without PayPal. 

Have you tried to make The shipping free?
[16.11.23, 19:29:44] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Sure, why not
[16.11.23, 19:29:45] ~ Allan L: Also you checked if The aov on The abandoned checkouts are smaller than the aov on sales?
[16.11.23, 19:29:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I can sell to US also just with European Stripe
[16.11.23, 19:30:16] ~ Peter: 😂😂I got paypal and everything man yeah I could try free shipping but it’ll hurt the margins
[16.11.23, 19:31:20] ~ Allan L: Well, something is off atm. And obviously you need a deep analysis to solve it. We are just Guessing, But s easy Way is to see if its The shipping Price that scares customers away
[16.11.23, 19:31:27] ~ Peter: Let me check that bro
[16.11.23, 19:32:02] ~ Peter: Yeah I understand man, I thought you were joking about the germany thing but you’re right
[16.11.23, 19:32:51] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Does anyone have a speed optimization contact for Funnelish?
[16.11.23, 19:33:39] ~ Peter: I checked man and there’s a huge difference
[16.11.23, 19:33:54] ~ Peter: So I’ll try to play around with the shipping costs
[16.11.23, 19:34:13] ~ Peter: Appreciate it man🤝🏻
[16.11.23, 19:34:34] ~ Mike Ramsey: You can -  you are just going to pay a lot more in credit card fees and have false declines.  

As you scale, you will want to leverage the entity in the US and process locally through it to eliminate 2-3% in cross border / currency conversion fees.

This will also help eliminate false declines by processing US customer transactions through your US entity vs. EU entity.  On average you will see a 8-10% (or more) increase in auth rates which has a direct line impact to your conversions.
[16.11.23, 19:36:49] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I have the same problem and I haven't figured it out yet. There was a bug with multicurrency before (conflicts with Shopify Markets and PageFly) and it was solved. Abandoned checkout improved but there is still a big drop
[16.11.23, 19:41:40] ~ Peter: Weird man unfortunately I’m not the person to help you, but I’d love to hear it when you’ve found a solution
[16.11.23, 19:51:31] ~ Dr Tim: Guys if you have UK and US LLC, is it advisable to open 2 stripe or just one?

I'm UK resident.
[16.11.23, 20:14:20] ~ Ivan C: Anyone have recommendations on how to boost up Trustpilot reviews? Whether buying reviews or getting VAs to input reviews thanks
[16.11.23, 20:21:23] ~ Kyle Twohill: Wondering this also
[16.11.23, 20:21:32] Carlos Leeseman: Dm me
[16.11.23, 21:15:40] ~ Natasha Iris: Being in the online review space for 4yrs I can say do not buy reviews. It’s actually against policy and if they see it’s paid for, reviews get removed and you’re back to where you started , star rating wise. 

I’d recommend organic pushing to your customers. I.e giving discount codes in packages for leaving reviews, disputing old negative reviews with trustpilot to get them removed. And reaching out to past customers who left negative reviews that you resolved issues with. Asking them to change their star rating and update their review. 

Reviews are a long play, but the goal is atleast 3.7 + star rating, we see have more customer sales. And positive impression on potential cust. 


Hope that helps! ‎<This message was edited>

[17.11.23, 20:45:55] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Hey everyone, I’m doing BF sale with a FREE GIFT PURCHASE. Do you guys know how to add the Free Gift in Shopify system so that when my fulfillment receives the order, they will know it includes the GIFT?
[17.11.23, 20:46:25] ~ Robert Gonzalez: What gift are you giving them?
[17.11.23, 20:46:47] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Physical gift, not a digital gift. Like the mask to their order.
[17.11.23, 20:47:35] ~ Robert Gonzalez: I’d say add it as a product and let them add that item to their cart, and do an automatic code buy 1 get 1 free
[17.11.23, 20:47:46] ~ Farhat Godil: I use monster upsell app which can let them add the free gift
[17.11.23, 20:50:15] ~ Amelia Nguyen: ok thank you
[17.11.23, 21:17:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I do this by just changing the SKU to something like "originalproduct+freegift"

[18.11.23, 5:33:54] ~ Luka: Does Microsoft Clarity show where the users spend more time on? Feels like it's the only missing feature.
Not talking about clicks or anything, but just where the user stops scrolling and pauses at certain sections?

If not, is there any service that offers this?
[18.11.23, 6:02:20] ~ Ignasi: Have you tried heatmaps? GA used to have them. I think hotjar has them
[18.11.23, 7:53:18] René Crooijmans: Hi guys, 

I am struggling to get any upsell to work for my product. So far I’ve tried adding:

 - The same product (2 different page & offer variations)
 - 3 products which solve the additional problems our customers will experience after making their initial purchase
 - 2 Products which solve the same problem in a different way
 - 7 Complimenting products solving different problems in the same niche 

All I’m able to get to work is an low ticket upsell which converts at 15% adding only a tiny amount to the AOV.

Any suggestions on what we could do to boost AOV?

We are already offering quantity breaks on the checkout as well as a lifetime guarantee. The take rate on the guarantee is roughly 50%.
[18.11.23, 7:54:58] ~ Luka: Clarity has heatmaps but it's based on clicks rather than time spent - looking at Hotjar, seems to be the same thing, click-based rather than time spent in each section
[18.11.23, 8:02:14] ~ Luka: Generally same product works best. Is it a giftable product? What we did was on our upsell we sold the same product and also gave a free gift with the upsell. We added a red bowtie on the image (product + packaging) and it helped boost our upsell take rate, even getting people to buy 2 more instead of just 1 more.

Few things that come to mind..

- What platform are you running on?
- Did you try modeling how other successful upsells are done? (Even using terms like" "One-Time Offer", timer, really good value offer (big discount, free shipping, etc) ?
- You may need a bit of a longer-form upsell page (or video) if you need to build the perceived value & justify the price. Think reviews, benefits section etc instead of just a typical short-form 1 section upsell page
[18.11.23, 8:08:40] René Crooijmans: Thank you for these insights bro. It is generally not a giftable product, but it is something we can experiment with with the holidays coming up. Angling the upsell as a gift and crafting the entire copy/graphics could definitely work. 

- We are running on Funnelish
- Yes, we have copied upsell pages from our competitors directly, used the Derila upsell template, and used many variations of both the Derila template and the competitor upsell templates. 
- Most of the times we would run medium/long form funnel pages with a decent chunk of copy and a combination of direct response elements to make them impulse. 

When you mention adding a video on the upsell page, what would you advise? Would you write a longer VSL, or simply embed a short video going over the main benefits and functionality?
[18.11.23, 8:10:10] René Crooijmans: Also, wouldn’t that video generally be something you put into production once the upsell is proven to convert as is?
[18.11.23, 8:34:47] ~ Luka: We're about to experiment with VSL on upsell pages as it seems to be doing really really good for Russel Brunson and other brands that have a really high AOV, including Peter Kell suggesting it. Personally haven't tested it yet. You don't have to do a high production shoot. Can take your best selling upsell, write a script, send it to a Fiverr spokesperson and have your video editor craft 2-3 different styles to split-test with.

It's quite odd that you tried so many different upsells and none are performing good which instantly made me think that something is off, either the offer or the upsell page copy/style. 

You could do a post-purchase quiz on your TY page asking people why they didn't take the upsells, that would give you insight directly from the customers.
[18.11.23, 8:54:25] Matán Intsuper: What I do regarding upsells and it always works, go to Amazon and check the ‘people who buy this also but…’ and use those as upsells
[18.11.23, 9:25:06] René Crooijmans: First concept sounds like a win 

Second point you mention: yes 100%. For our main landing page the style we use works like a charm but with the upsell no luck yet. 

Third point, I’m going to give that a try
[18.11.23, 9:25:14] René Crooijmans: That didn’t work unfortunately
[18.11.23, 9:54:13] ~ Maxi: Guys do you use „multiadvertiser ads“ in meta ?
[18.11.23, 12:43:11] ~ Mubasel: I dont, i just dont like the placement of these ads
[18.11.23, 14:31:57] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: A trick that works very well for us

is to create an upsell and turn it into a must-have

For example
You sell menstrual panties and indicate that these washing machine bags are highly recommended so as not to damage your panties, and that if you take them, you'll be offered a 2-year extended warranty.

It works really well.

Warranties also work well on their own
[18.11.23, 14:32:36] René Crooijmans: Very nice
[18.11.23, 14:32:44] René Crooijmans: Thank you! Will be trying @⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩

I have an LLC, EIN & ITIN + US Lease agreement. But they're still asking for a US co-signor. Or if anyone has payment processing solutions for those outside of the US I'd really appreciate
[18.11.23, 17:29:00] Matán Intsuper: Is that something new? I have us stripe and PayPal without being a us person
[18.11.23, 17:31:02] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: Staying away for Stripe / Shopify payments atm, they put me on a 20% reserve even though my Chargeback rate was around 0.61%-0.8%. Looking for a private processor if possible
[18.11.23, 17:31:12] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: *staying away from
[18.11.23, 17:31:36] Matán Intsuper: You can try authorize net with first data.. I used to have them but now I’m good with stripe PayPal and Shopify payments
[18.11.23, 17:32:10] Matán Intsuper: Or just hire someone in the us
[18.11.23, 18:34:40] ~ Farhat Godil: For people selling on Facebook shop is there a way to increase AOV . FB is sending most traffic to shop in Advantage campaign so people are not able to buy upsells like they do on websites
[18.11.23, 18:35:18] ~ Farhat Godil: I have added upsell products in the confirmation email but not converting that well
[19.11.23, 3:45:26] ~ Haroon: Hi guys I’ve seen people targeting worldwide with Facebook ads. How do they calculate the VAT in product calcution for EU/ worldwide ? What do I have to be aware of taxes when I target worldwide instead only Germany with my ads? 

Thx
[19.11.23, 3:47:10] Yaniv: if its below certain amount no taxes needed, Shopify knows already when you reach the right amount to start charge taxes based on the state.
[19.11.23, 3:48:06] ~ Haroon: Isn’t it better to include it already? Is it possible to hit those numbers in specific countries? Do you have the VAT collection active in shopify? I don’t
[19.11.23, 3:48:49] Yaniv: Yes I do have it on
[19.11.23, 3:49:09] ~ Haroon: Would you recommend me having it on always?
[19.11.23, 3:49:25] ~ Haroon: Will the VAT be added on top so the customer pays it ?
[19.11.23, 3:49:40] Yaniv: I think in your case its different, we are US based company please consult with an accountant to know for sure! or reach Shopify phone support they are super helpful with these questions. ‎<This message was edited>

[19.11.23, 15:04:34] ~ Luka: *What are some job positions/hires that REALLY helped elevate your brand that you'd highly recommend?*

For us it was actually getting an amazing graphic designer. Having a full-time graphic designer (+ can do 3D Modeling) who can pump out hundreds of unique image ads, create all the visuals, landers (we sometimes outsource LPs), email campaigns and everything in-house was a game changer and made our brand look so much better & more congruent across different platforms. Plus made life easier and saved us money too.

[20.11.23, 11:01:56] ~ Tim Alleraun: Our sales volume atm is already the highest it’s been so far - supplier says these costs come from increasing shipping prices..
[20.11.23, 11:07:31] ~ Tim Alleraun: Can suppliers sign contracts with shipping companies to prevent those increases? Just curious
[20.11.23, 11:11:29] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hello guys,

Urgent, I need an facebook Ad account for a health brand.

My current agency has had the accounts blocked and can't do or open anything.

We're looking for an agency ideally at 0% that can offer cashback and support health brands.

The brand has made 5M in the last 1 year on different markets.
[20.11.23, 12:04:46] ~ Haroon: Guys how can I prevent/stop shopify to track my own sessions when I visit my shop from my phone/pc to check something, any tricks?
[20.11.23, 12:28:57] ~ Santi Roa: If you want to build a team, then a Culture Manager/Talent manager 
(HR).

But as I kept thinking, there is no position that will really change it all. It depends on your strategy, your brand, your expertise, and the context of your situation right now.

I'd say what will definitely elevate your brand is building a solid team. Then, who to hire will depend and you will slowly build it upon your needs ‎<This message was edited>

[20.11.23, 20:14:43] ~ Dr Tim: Guys selling in the UK, is Stripe better than PayPal or PayPal still determines levels of profitability?
[20.11.23, 20:15:06] ~ Dr Tim: Prefer to avoid PayPal if possible, any idea?
[20.11.23, 20:24:13] ~ Mike Ramsey: I would say both are important since Paypal is more so a Payment Method / Wallet on it’s own and Stripe is a processor who provides payment methods, wallets and local APM’s.

Having both options set up and displaying 4-5 payment methods at checkout is best to optimize conversions.
[20.11.23, 23:55:20] Yaniv: For the guys that are shipping to US from China, how do you deal with orders that are getting “delivered” successfully while clients never received their package? It is just normal USPS from my supplier in china (yunexpress) it is happening occasionally tho.
[20.11.23, 23:57:06] ~ RS: Same man. Yesterday a customer emailed me and sent me a letter that their local delivery provider sent her, and they said that package was lost in transit, and told her to contact the seller. Even though they lost the package
[20.11.23, 23:59:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah same issue. Especially with DHL and GLS in Europe its very bad
[21.11.23, 0:26:29] ~ Tarlan: Upsell sales are not synced with Shopify. Orders without upsells was working perfectly. 

However when I buy upsells, not only upsells, initial order by itself does not push to shopify neither. 

I turned on bundle for all products & upsells, and set wait time 5 minutes. 

I’ve been waiting for Funnelish since Friday but they take too long and still no solution. 

Anyone knows how to fix it?
[21.11.23, 0:34:18] Yaniv: Your supplier allows you to do DHL from china? I thought it’s too pricey and only for samples
[21.11.23, 0:48:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: As local carrier only, i use yunexpress
[21.11.23, 8:49:14] Carlos Leeseman: I fixed with my supplier that all orders will be shipped with DHL, PostNL and bpost

[21.11.23, 13:23:39] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Guys, how do you calculate the testing budget so that you get atleast 50 sales in 1 week? If it works so that it gets out of Learning phase?
[21.11.23, 13:35:07] ~ Ignasi: In our case: 50xCPA/7
[21.11.23, 13:37:01] ~ Dr Tim: So this becomes the daily budget?

Say CPA is $20.

50 * 20 = 1000/7 = $142/day budget yeah?
[21.11.23, 13:38:02] Carlos Leeseman: What is the reason for this? Just curious
[21.11.23, 13:39:47] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Thanks🫡

[21.11.23, 15:52:34] ~ lengjoo: just talked to your ad account rep?
[21.11.23, 15:53:13] ~ lengjoo: are there certain criterias? I spoke to google and they said they only take bank transfer, wire and cheque for monthly invoicing
[21.11.23, 15:53:40] ~ lengjoo: Google: 

To apply for monthly invoicing the ads account should be at least 1 year old.
You might be able to use the monthly invoicing payment setting if your business meets certain requirements. These requirement include, but aren't limited to the following:

Being registered as a business for a minimum of one year.
Having an active Google Ads account in good standing for a minimum of one year.
Spending a minimum of $5,000 a month (this can vary by country) for any 3 of the last 12 months.
[21.11.23, 15:54:35] ~ Robin: Ohh on Google I don’t know, I don’t have that on my Google account, only on FB.
[21.11.23, 15:54:54] ~ lengjoo: will try for FB, will be great help for cashflow lol

[21.11.23, 19:30:05] ~ Farhat Godil: I had same issue until I realized that my integration in loox was on for shop pay reviews hence they were being reflected in the loox reviews as well
[21.11.23, 19:30:21] ~ Farhat Godil: Once I turned integration off shop reviews are gone
[21.11.23, 19:31:39] ~ G M: Ah got it. I need to check then.

[21.11.23, 21:31:36] René Crooijmans: ‎Lucia Van removed René Crooijmans
[21.11.23, 22:56:11] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Which funnels builder is the best in your opinion? Funnelish or ClickFunnels, it feels like Funnelish a much conversion rate than for example a Shopify store would do.
[21.11.23, 22:56:27] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Much worse*
[21.11.23, 22:59:52] Yaniv: The best connection is just not to use them
[21.11.23, 23:27:38] ~ Y: How come you have worse conv. Rate in funnelish compared to shopify ? Can you share details if you want me to look into your funnel
[22.11.23, 0:11:11] Topi: Due to failed payments, we stopped using due to literally every other payment is failed. Using Klarna and stripe. Tested both Klarna trough stripe and merchant. Same issue. With shopify dont have this
[22.11.23, 0:20:30] ~ Y: Can you pm me your account email i will check it if you want
[22.11.23, 0:21:06] Topi: Sure
[22.11.23, 2:01:04] ~ Maxi: Stripe has a lot of failed payments especially if its crossborder.

For funnelish & cards i would recommend checkout.com , NMI or maybe mollie.
[22.11.23, 2:59:40] ~ Tarlan: How long did it take you to get onboarded with checkout.com ? I contacted them couple times but never heard back.
[22.11.23, 4:39:15] ~ Mike Ramsey: Agree - been seeing more failures on Stripe with funnleish specifically.  

Checkout.com seems to perform better overall.  NMI is a bit unique as it depends on who you leverage as the acquirer via their gateway and the region in which you are set up.
[22.11.23, 5:39:46] ~ Lachy Waldon: does anyone know where to get a verified Klavyio account for textinf in AUS? BFCM campaign was meant to go out to 50k+ customers this evening but we havent verified our account for texts in AUS
[22.11.23, 8:02:39] ~ Marko: Does anyone know why metrics like CTR don’t show in DCT on fb? Hard to make decisions like this
[22.11.23, 16:02:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: anyone here knows a AI tool that can pull scripts from videos?
[22.11.23, 16:02:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i heard there was a free one
[22.11.23, 16:03:27] Bob: You can get it from slack if you upload the video
[22.11.23, 16:04:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: oh really, how?
[22.11.23, 16:05:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: oh got it
[22.11.23, 16:05:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: thanks!
[22.11.23, 16:05:48] ~ Denys: chat GPT 4 can do that with plugins
[22.11.23, 16:32:16] ~ Luka: The transcript of a specific video?
[22.11.23, 16:32:27] ~ Luka: Yeah just upload to slack. Send it to yourself and the transcript is there
[22.11.23, 16:32:37] ~ Jeremy Leppink: jeah transcript
[22.11.23, 16:32:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: got it, that was easy
[22.11.23, 16:32:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: thanks :)

[22.11.23, 16:47:31] ~ Dr Tim: Guys do you use @gmail or similar to open PayPal or corporate email address?

Is there a difference?
[22.11.23, 16:57:11] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys for our health brand, all our facebook Ads account are restricted.

We had one account for each shopify + market (5 ad account) 

We opened some accounts this week and they got blocked today 🥲

Any last minute advice on tuning up for BFCM?
[22.11.23, 16:58:06] Matán Intsuper: agency accounts maybe ?
[22.11.23, 16:58:36] Matán Intsuper: whats the reason for the blocks? are you getting many rejected ads? are your ads against policy? low feedback score?
[22.11.23, 16:59:24] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: All agency account
[22.11.23, 16:59:39] Matán Intsuper: donno, i use my personal accounts, no issues. i guess your agency got restricted and its not you
[22.11.23, 16:59:43] Matán Intsuper: try a different agency
[22.11.23, 16:59:59] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Only a fed rejected ads
Score page is 3,9+
[22.11.23, 17:00:14] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We have trey 3 agency and same problem
[22.11.23, 17:00:25] Matán Intsuper: cant you get a fb rep ?
[22.11.23, 17:00:30] Matán Intsuper: or unblock them using the insider?
[22.11.23, 17:15:30] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I haven't heard back from the agency,

I'm going to check with the agency to see if it's okay for me to pay an insider, because surely their account manager won't want that.
[22.11.23, 17:15:37] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Maybe best way is to use normal account?
[22.11.23, 18:33:37] ~ Alex: I have a connection for grey hat fb agency accounts but they take a % of adspend. Could be a quick fix for the next few days and you wont get banned
[22.11.23, 18:34:23] ~ Maxi: Im also using greyhat stuff with like 7% but its good for a quick fix as long as you not spend like 500k or 1M
‎[22.11.23, 21:04:17] ~ Alessandro Sassi: ‎image omitted
[22.11.23, 21:06:24] ~ Zain Ahmed: you have to reach out to them. There should be an option in there somewhere
[22.11.23, 21:06:52] ~ Zain Ahmed: Or it might be through support idr
[22.11.23, 21:08:51] ~ Ecomcesar: Guys how do youc alculate the kook rate in facebook?
[22.11.23, 21:17:37] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Custom metric: (3sec video plays / ipressions ) %
[22.11.23, 21:32:13] ~ Ecomcesar: Thanks
[22.11.23, 21:32:18] ~ Ecomcesar: What is a good number ?
[22.11.23, 21:32:20] ~ Ecomcesar: 🙂

[23.11.23, 0:58:40] ~ Allan L: Anyone Got a contact to get a Wyoming LLC going? Looking to get a fast EIN and maybe ITIN as well so I Can get PayPal
[23.11.23, 0:59:26] Matán Intsuper: ein you will receive quickly but itin is 1-2 months and more complicated
[23.11.23, 0:59:41] Matán Intsuper: try slash - they provide a business+personal bank accounts + company creation service.
[23.11.23, 1:00:25] ~ Allan L: Already Got The business formation. So looking for just a ein and ITIN or atleast a good Way of getting PayPal
[23.11.23, 1:02:01] Matán Intsuper: oh well ITIN i did physicaly in the US.. EIN i got with the company, not sure how you formed a company without EIN. I know that there are services to get an ITIN virtually but you need notary and all those things and it takes at least 45 days.
[23.11.23, 1:02:11] Matán Intsuper: I think EIN takes 2 weeks.
[23.11.23, 1:03:28] ~ Allan L: I belive a EIN is a upsell for most services. But The one i used suddenly Said they couldt get EIN before 2 months. I am Living in EU so need something without physical being in The US
[23.11.23, 2:58:47] ~ ZaccT: Hello everyone. I’m new here, looking forward to being part of this group :)

[23.11.23, 9:29:03] ~ Aashi: Hi guys, i want to test 2 product pages (one created in pagefly and one in replo), how is your experience using VWO? Or can you suggest any other platform where i can host a redirect test?
[23.11.23, 9:29:48] ~ Luka: Personally never liked VWO. Currently using Convert.com and like it more, and support answers questions fairly quickly
[23.11.23, 9:41:00] ~ Maxi: Are those tools also recommend for split-testing in funnelish, even they have their own split testing function ?
[23.11.23, 9:44:26] ~ Jocke: What do you guys do in terms of GDPR bar/pop-up on your advertorials?
[23.11.23, 9:47:15] ~ Aashi: Thanks Luka, will check it out!
[23.11.23, 9:55:15] ~ Luka: Perhaps Funnelish users can comment on this, but back when we were using Clickfunnels heavily (has a built-in split-testing function like funnelish), we just used the CF Built in system. Gives you the data you need
[23.11.23, 9:56:23] ~ Amelia Nguyen: If you still need help with this, let me know. I might be able to help you. I know a Wyoming Agency that can open an LLC for you with nominee service and you can use their address as your physical address.
[23.11.23, 12:09:03] ~ busy: whats the name?
[23.11.23, 12:10:04] ~ Maxi: Is it possible to get a US Amex with that setup ?
[23.11.23, 21:22:45] ~ lengjoo: Hey guys, anyone has FB rep contact, please help, ad account got disabled for "We’ve disabled your ad account to protect your personal and financial info. To run ads again, you'll need to fill out a form to request an account review."

Idk how long the review is going to take, BFCM starts in a few hours, any help will be greatly appreciate, will return the favor in the future 🙏🏻🙏🏻
[23.11.23, 21:22:55] ~ lengjoo: banned and unbanned and banned again
[23.11.23, 21:49:45] ~ lengjoo: nvm got it back, thanks to those who pmed 🙏🏻
[23.11.23, 22:03:50] Matán Intsuper: One hour of stress 😉
[23.11.23, 22:04:15] Matán Intsuper: Those kind of bans are usually quick to solve
[23.11.23, 22:04:19] Matán Intsuper: There are worse things
[23.11.23, 22:04:39] Matán Intsuper: And insiders cannot help with that
[24.11.23, 0:27:26] ~ Michael Abovyan: Anyone know the best way to make funnelish automation with Klaviyo. Scaled a little too hard need to catch people with abandoned cart, welcome series etc. (any way to do this without remaking the automations in funnelish?)
[24.11.23, 1:20:41] ~ Dr Tim: What are the best black Friday deals for software/app you've found?

Interested in AI tools, tracking, Shopify apps etc.

I'm interested!
[24.11.23, 4:25:02] ~ Y: create two workflow automations (funnel or global ones), one triggered by optins/purchase attempts, and then adds to list in Klaviyo (a Leads list).

Another, triggered by purchases, and it adds to another list in Klaviyo (a purchases list).

Now in klaviyo (if havent already) make a flow automation, that is triggered when a customer is added to the leads list, and wait 30mins or so, then check if they are in buyers list. that's how to do abandoned cart. 

Welcome series is easy, just trigger it whenever someone is added to the buyers list.
[24.11.23, 6:16:03] ~ Michael Abovyan: Only problem is with abandoned cart is Klaviyo dynamic products won’t work, unless they actually do?
[24.11.23, 7:49:25] ~ lengjoo: it really was lol

I am dropshipping, there is no contract with customers or supplier yet. Funnel isn't live.
[24.11.23, 17:02:38] ~ Santi Roa: Hey guys, is the first time we do Bid caps (we tested 3 days ago, it didn't work) but now we have 4 adsets with 5 roas (spending 500/day)

Should we scale it up like maniacs? How much?
[24.11.23, 17:34:25] ~ Maxi: That are good results, are there any tutorials on how to scale with bid and / or cost caps ?

[25.11.23, 5:24:32] ~ Ecomcesar: Today I had same conversion rate but my CPC went up due to higher CPMs and now today I have 10% profit
[25.11.23, 5:24:39] ~ Ecomcesar: What would you suggest me to do ?
[25.11.23, 5:24:55] ~ Ecomcesar: Keep scalling or lower budgets ?
[25.11.23, 5:26:52] ~ Julián Rodríguez: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[25.11.23, 6:00:00] ~ Santi Roa: Maybe your offer/channel mix is weak for BFCM

[25.11.23, 9:55:08] ~ Nicco: Hey guys, is someone scaling with yt shorts ads?

[26.11.23, 16:01:16] ~ Nim: For us, better results showing price on checkout page.
[26.11.23, 19:31:29] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ive tested this small scale, had better results without price on sales page
[26.11.23, 22:25:36] ~ Omid: Saturday Sunday dropped for me, had 3.5 roas Friday on some adsets scaled, waited 24 hours, decreased today since after 24 hours 25-30% drop compared to Friday. Lowered budgets and bids ‎<This message was edited>

Is it also important to always have min. 10% add to cart rate? If so, 10% atc from the product page or 10% atc from the advertorial page? 

Thanks.

What can you do? ‎<This message was edited>

[27.11.23, 13:15:08] ~ Daniel Lai: Contact facebook support and they will run an investigation on it and then you can get a refund for the budget spent, happened to me before and I got back $1k the hacker spent

But beware once facebook knows, they lock BMs and stuff and even restrict profiles etc to secure accounts, because of this I lost an ad account / profile
[27.11.23, 13:15:52] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Okay thank you
[27.11.23, 13:17:21] ~ Marko: Does anyone know if it’s possible to sell a branded dropshipping store? We did 500k+ with it and have a 10.000+ email list. Last months we didn’t do much revenue.
[27.11.23, 14:33:13] ~ Alex: Yeah you can, in the process of selling mine. Can connect you with my broker. If its on a downward trend it will more difficult to get a good price

[27.11.23, 19:20:19] ~ L: Hi guys, how accurate are the data you see in Microsoft Clarity?

I'm sending traffic to an advertorial built with PageFly on Shopify (I hid the header and the footer), but Clarity is not tracking the traffic landing on that page.

Is it possible that when you hide the header and footer with PageFly, the code in Theme Liquid is no longer there?
[27.11.23, 19:28:37] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Does it track correctly if you keep the header and footer active?
[27.11.23, 19:56:07] ~ L: I actually haven’t checked cause I don’t want people to see the logo while reading the advertorial -

That’s why I asked, I wanted to see if anyone faced the same issue
[27.11.23, 20:01:51] ~ Denys: What do you think is the price range for a similar store with similar numbers? Just curious to know.
[27.11.23, 20:08:06] ~ Alex: They suggested a listing price of 3.5x/4x multiple of my net profit over the last 12 months
[27.11.23, 20:11:42] ~ Denys: Could you recommend some websites that you use?
[27.11.23, 22:28:51] ~ Ecomcesar: But Maximun variants I'm being able to add its 4, is there a way to get 6 variants?

[27.11.23, 23:59:20] ~ Ecomcesar: does anyone know how to create an automation in funnelish to add all abandoned carts to a list in klaviyo?
[27.11.23, 23:59:21] ~ Ecomcesar: highly apprecieated!
[27.11.23, 23:59:23] ~ Ecomcesar: 🙏🙂💪🔥
[28.11.23, 7:15:04] Topi: Yes, just automations, optin -> integrations -> choose klaviyo -> add to list

[28.11.23, 11:50:23] ~ Denys: Hey guys, I received an email from a customer stating that the product was delivered to his location over the weekend when he wasn't there. The delivery service apparently just left it near the door, and when he arrived, the package was gone. Now he is asking for a replacement. What would you do in such a situation? I think he should contact the delivery service or the police. Is that correct?
[28.11.23, 11:52:17] ~ Dr Tim: I'd personally replace and move on. You don't want customer disputing unless it's a high value item.

Misplaced deliveries happen every time.
[28.11.23, 12:04:58] ~ Alex: Same, you want the customer to come back. 

We have it in our supplier agreement if its delivered but not recieved that they will reship again for free. Its worth negotiating with your supplier on what they are liable to cover for free reshipments
[28.11.23, 12:42:43] ~ Denys: thank you, guys
[28.11.23, 13:03:12] ~ Luka: How effective is TikTok with DMCAs?  We submitted a DMCA of a full ripoff of our product, brand, images etc but they're still up & selling
[28.11.23, 13:05:33] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I am having the same experience. At first TikTok asked us to provide more proof, and then they stopped responding. Content still online
[28.11.23, 13:06:55] ~ Luka: For us we just got an automated email with no follow-up, will resubmit again and launch our own shop there now
[28.11.23, 13:48:04] ~ Malik: Hey guys what do you think of those stats ? It's the first day of testing for this funnel. I sell a 100€ product and it spent 60€ as of now - not a lot but I'm just trying to figure out early what can be done
‎[28.11.23, 13:48:08] ~ Malik: ‎image omitted
[28.11.23, 13:48:08] ~ Malik: Thank you
[28.11.23, 13:48:42] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 21% optins and no sales?
[28.11.23, 13:48:56] ~ Malik: yes 7 or 8 opt ins
[28.11.23, 13:49:03] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is your checkout working?
[28.11.23, 13:49:26] ~ Malik: It should be because it works on an other funnel - but I haven't done a test order
[28.11.23, 14:48:28] ~ Maxi: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[28.11.23, 16:02:03] ~ Peter: Always appeal
[28.11.23, 16:02:23] ~ Peter: And if not approved; delete
[28.11.23, 16:10:27] ~ Maxi: Alright 👍🏻
[28.11.23, 18:39:48] ~ Zain Ahmed: funnelish people, how are you collecting sales tax? i dont feel like paying taxjar 500$ a month so I’m wondering if i can use stripe to collect tax and import into shopify and use another plugin to autofile ‎<This message was edited>
[28.11.23, 18:40:43] ~ David B: @⁨~Natasha Iris⁩
[28.11.23, 20:23:34] ~ Franco: Hey guys, hope yall are crushing the start of the week.

We’re testing a lot of different scroll stoppers right now, along with new scripts. I was wondering do you guys use a database to store all of the hook lines & hook visuals you guys are testing, perhaps using them to test new scripts? ‎<This message was edited>
[28.11.23, 21:15:55] ~ Ecomcesar: Guys Triple Whale works with Funnelish?
[28.11.23, 21:22:10] ~ Natasha Iris: It doesn’t look like StripeTax is fully integrated with Funnelish as TaxJar is.

Curious, are you looking to manually pull the Stripe tax data (assuming you would use Stripe tax) and then push to Shopify for all sales within Funnelish?  Funnelish wouldn’t automatically do that based on lack of integration with Stripe Tax.

It may take some work and manual process to do this which would likely outweigh the cost of paying $500/month.
[28.11.23, 21:59:45] ~ Lareina: 🙏🏼Anyone knows any agency/services who can remove those counterfeit businesses that are infringing using other brands’ name and logo to sell on other platforms like Amazon? Or any similar experience and you have fought against it? Much appreciated!
[28.11.23, 22:21:52] ~ Zain Ahmed: the idea is that stripe tax would just be included in the same transaction as the product purchase. I already push all funnelish orders to shopify because thats where my fullfillment services pulls from
[28.11.23, 23:04:25] ~ Natasha Iris: Got it. We would need to confirm if Stripe Tax would break out the calculations in Funnelish and pass that to Shopify with the product purchase.  

Based on my research I am not seeing it.
[29.11.23, 0:55:15] Yaniv: No
[29.11.23, 0:57:25] ~ Mike Ramsey: @⁨~Avv. Isidoro Capuano⁩ any recommendations here?  (cease and desist?)

[29.11.23, 3:44:32] Yaniv: Any announcement bar app you guys would recommended using? (for Shopify) ‎<This message was edited>
[29.11.23, 10:29:16] ~ Marko: What's up! We are starting to sell in the US, but don't have an LLC set up yet so we have very high currency conversion fees when transferring funds to Europe. I am wondering whether it would be possible to use the same PayPal account that receives money from customers to pay for things like ad spend and other business expenses. That way we could avoid some of the conversion fees. Curious if anyone has any experience with this.
[29.11.23, 11:04:31] ~ Maxi: Guys with a T+3 funding payout time, when would the payout be from a Mondays revenue ?

Wednesday or Thursdsy ?
[29.11.23, 11:05:15] ~ David B: @⁨~Natasha Iris⁩
[29.11.23, 12:37:54] ~ Malik: Hi guys, how do you reduce the image size and improve loading speed on your advertorials ? I'm looking at clarity and they load slowly compared to my videos on the same page. Thank you !
[29.11.23, 12:38:10] ~ Luka: TinyPNG / CompressPNG
[29.11.23, 12:38:20] ~ Luka: Lazyload enabled
[29.11.23, 12:38:23] ~ Malik: On Funnelish* Sorry I forgot
[29.11.23, 12:39:12] ~ Luka: And instead of GIFs, what you can do is upload that GIF/Video to Wistia, and set the thumbnail to be the whole video. That's how we display our 3D animations without having the person click "play" or hurting page speed. Wistia is great and very well optimized
[29.11.23, 12:39:46] ~ Malik: Thank you for the insights! Are you running on Funnelish ?
[29.11.23, 12:41:31] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Is that an app or do you just add the uploaded link on the page?
[29.11.23, 12:44:10] ~ Santi Roa: I'd speak with an IP attorney first
Do you have any IP? Trademarks, design patent, etc?
[29.11.23, 13:27:00] ~ Luka: Personally no, but the GIF/Wistia thing is just a wistia embed code so will work on any platform really
[29.11.23, 13:29:35] ~ Luka: You first upload the video on your Wistia.com account, then set the thumbnail to be video (attached pic) and then you use the take the embed code and place it where you need
‎[29.11.23, 13:29:40] ~ Luka: ‎image omitted
[29.11.23, 13:32:40] ~ G M: I think the best way is to use on funnelish the section: custom Html. Add your video.mp4 to shopify files, take the link, and use this code:


<video style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25) 4px 4px 16px;
border-top-left-radius: 10px;border-top-right-radius: 10px;
border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;" playsinline="" muted="" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay"><source type="video/mp4" src="linkshopify.mp4"> Your browser does not support our video. </video>
[29.11.23, 13:33:30] ~ G M: and insert the link in the code, where I wrote: linkshopify.mp4. I found it as the best way
[29.11.23, 13:33:33] ~ Allan L: Anyone got a custom code for pagefly for product variant picker?
I want to be able to have it without the package pricing, but custom price text for each variant and boxes with images (clickable boes)
[29.11.23, 13:47:25] ~ Robin: And this does not mess up the speed?
[29.11.23, 13:48:36] ~ Malik: That's how I do it for the videos exactly!
[29.11.23, 13:48:48] ~ Malik: But for the images I think the only way is to compress them before uploading them
[29.11.23, 13:48:51] ~ G M: Nope, it just improve it.
[29.11.23, 13:48:52] ~ Malik: with Ez Gif or something
[29.11.23, 13:50:51] ~ Aashi: Hey, you can try converting your png to webp. The quality is better than the normal compressed ones + the size is in kbs! 
I am able to bring down the size from 2mb to 600kbs for images including GIFS too.
[29.11.23, 13:51:16] ~ Malik: Nice! I'll try it too
[29.11.23, 13:51:22] ~ Malik: Thank you all
[29.11.23, 13:52:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: you can change a .gif to .webp and still functions as a gif?
[29.11.23, 13:53:33] ~ Aashi: Yes! Just make sure to put the settings to loop forever. I use ezgif and this is an option there.
[29.11.23, 13:57:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: oh great, thanks! Didnt know that
[29.11.23, 15:29:18] ~ Mike Ramsey: Thursday

[29.11.23, 20:07:49] ~ Natasha Iris: Have you checked your authorization rates lately?

Nothing worse than having a customer who is ready to pay and they have a false decline which impacts conversions.

Learn how to pull and evaluate this data against benchmarks to ensure you are maximizing conversions.  In most cases, you can pick up an extra 2-3% in failed payments by making adjustments or leveraging a stronger provider within the region you are selling.

[29.11.23, 20:49:23] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yes, if you pay your suppliers via Paypal in USD then you would not be charged for the currency conversion to Euro or withdrawal fee for USD.

Paypal will charge however if you take it off their platform by withdrawing, (2-3%) but if you pay suppliers or vendors via Paypal then you can avoid that.
[29.11.23, 21:25:11] ~ Haroon: Someone experienced in selling ebooks/pdfs?

[30.11.23, 8:42:34] ~ Maxi: Yeah me aswell, also our ad account isn’t spending for whatever reason today
[30.11.23, 8:44:09] Yaniv: Yes it’s for everyone
[30.11.23, 8:44:58] ~ Maxi: Has also someone the issue that the account isn’t spending ?

Mine is in EST time zone it’s almost 2 AM there so it should have spent a little atleast
[30.11.23, 8:45:26] Yaniv: Yes got this thing too, it will spend all at once later be ready for it mentally
[30.11.23, 8:45:38] ~ Maxi: Nice

[30.11.23, 9:43:40] ~ lengjoo: fb is still spending but not updating the spend amount?
[30.11.23, 9:45:28] ~ Maxi: I don’t know, my accounts are at 0 spend since yesterday
[30.11.23, 9:45:42] ~ Maxi: stopped spending around 12 AM
[30.11.23, 9:45:58] ~ Maxi: Balance limit also not changed
[30.11.23, 9:46:28] ~ lengjoo: we're stuck at 2k spend for a long time but we're getting traffic oo
[30.11.23, 9:46:34] ~ lengjoo: are you getting traffic? @⁨~Maxi⁩
[30.11.23, 9:46:39] ~ Maxi: No
[30.11.23, 9:47:27] ~ Luka: Yeah no traffic here either
[30.11.23, 9:47:44] ~ lengjoo: mm ours might be from other ad platforms then
[30.11.23, 9:47:45] ~ Luka: Stopped ~2 hrs ago
[30.11.23, 9:48:42] ~ lengjoo: we have a 50% drop in traffic since 7 hours ago
[30.11.23, 9:48:51] ~ lengjoo: yours only happened 2 hours ago?
[30.11.23, 9:49:07] ~ Luka: Yeah
[30.11.23, 9:49:10] ~ Marin: yep, FB stopped spending on couple of my ad accounts as well
[30.11.23, 9:49:31] ~ lengjoo: ah damn
[30.11.23, 9:50:03] ~ lengjoo: i can imagine fb coming out and saying reporting issue and billing us LOL
[30.11.23, 9:50:56] ~ Marin: they can't be, as the ads are not spending at all

interestingly, it's happening on only 2 accounts of mine, out of which 1 started spending an hour ago
[30.11.23, 9:51:39] ~ Luka: That 1 is now getting traffic?
[30.11.23, 9:52:44] ~ lengjoo: good roas?
[30.11.23, 9:52:53] ~ lengjoo: idk why is ours reporting 5.4 roas lol
[30.11.23, 9:53:55] ~ lengjoo: im seeing some orders coming in from fb using UTMs
[30.11.23, 9:54:01] ~ lengjoo: but acc shows it's not spending
[30.11.23, 9:54:03] ~ Bilel: Same here. $0 spend today
[30.11.23, 9:54:20] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Mine did spent but had a shitty day lol
[30.11.23, 9:55:33] ~ Marin: yeah, that one is getting traffic now

ROAS looks amazing because there's was spend through the day, but since it stopped spending, and delayed conversions from 7dc1dv started piling up, it looks like FB is amazing, but it's just stacking revenue on 0 additional spend, so ROAS looks way better
[30.11.23, 10:32:44] ~ Marko: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ I just want to be careful using the same Paypal that receives money to make payments to suppliers, meta or other vendors, because a Paypal restriction would make things really difficult right now. I don’t know if doing that would raise a red flag with Paypal. Any insights?
[30.11.23, 10:53:56] ~ RS: Hey, what are the main payment methods if selling to Sweden? Getting very many payment declines with USA stripe and even more declines with HK stripe. PayPal works good. Maybe there are other payment methods that swedish people use, for example, klarna or something like that
[30.11.23, 10:54:18] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Like 90% Klarna, Im Swedish.
[30.11.23, 10:54:24] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Otherwise Card
[30.11.23, 10:54:36] ~ RS: Okay, Thanks man!
[30.11.23, 11:19:41] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Man we have the same thing happening
[30.11.23, 11:28:55] ~ Daniel: same for me, fb says no known issues

https://metastatus.com/
[30.11.23, 12:03:49] ~ BG: Same here stopped spending since 9:00 pm yesterday.
[30.11.23, 12:23:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is it just me or are Google Merchant centers getting blocked left right and center
[30.11.23, 12:24:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Had some merchants running for over 1,5 years, all of a sudden they get misrepresentation
[30.11.23, 12:29:38] ~ G M: Guys I received a complaint from consumer protection in the state of Michigan, filled out by a customer who did not receive a refund (because she could not get one according to our policies).

In the letter they tell me that I have to respond within 10 days or else I will pay a $25,000 fine.

How can I resolve this?  Do you have a lawyer I can rely on?
[30.11.23, 13:13:13] ~ Tim Alleraun: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[30.11.23, 13:34:13] ~ Paul: Yeah our meta campaigns are not spending either since today
[30.11.23, 14:22:24] ~ Denys: Hey guys, what apps or services do you use to export amazon reviews?

[30.11.23, 14:56:02] ~ G M: Also, could be an option
[30.11.23, 15:44:32] ~ Michael Abovyan: anyone know really good affiliate programs for book a call funnels?
[30.11.23, 15:51:00] ~ Santi Roa: Whatever you do, Lawyer up
[30.11.23, 15:51:35] ~ Santi Roa: These things are not joke
[30.11.23, 16:01:34] ~ Maxi: have ad accounts started to spend again ?
[30.11.23, 16:09:36] ~ Michael Abovyan: this is for a micro home company (AOV ~100kusd). GoAffPro which we use for eCommerce does not work for this funnel, and partnerstack is a B2B SAAS program. So any recommendations for would be very helpful.
[30.11.23, 16:12:41] ~ Luka: Traffic running again yeah
[30.11.23, 16:21:49] ~ Mohammed-amine: Fb ads all good now
[30.11.23, 16:22:54] ~ Mohammed-amine: How do you guys transcribe videos?
[30.11.23, 16:28:17] ~ Michael Abovyan: cap cut has pretty good free version
[30.11.23, 16:29:34] ~ Luka: Send it to yourself on Slack. Slack transcribes the whole video for you for free
[30.11.23, 16:29:53] ~ Mohammed-amine: Slack makes a lot of spelling mistakes
[30.11.23, 16:30:22] ~ Luka: Personally don't find it a problem since we re-write the script anyways
[30.11.23, 16:31:22] ~ Mohammed-amine: Thanks tho, will check some paid softwares online

[30.11.23, 17:34:04] ~ Mohammed-amine: Will check that out
[30.11.23, 19:50:24] ~ Paul: Yes mine has. Talked to meta chat support and also manually increased meta internal spending limit (not payment treshhold) It wasn’t maxed out at all, but maybe that did help in some way
[30.11.23, 20:40:56] ~ Haroon: I have a question for all of you guys.

1. how much rev are y’all currently making per month? With how many products?

2. if you guys test, do you test multiple products a day and try to finish landing page and stuff within a couple hours to see validation with simple marketing?

Or do you test one product for couple of weeks with multiple angles and invest more money into creatives and stuff (more like forcing?)

What is y’all recommendation? Would help a lot
[30.11.23, 21:06:31] ~ Santi Roa: 1) 2.2m/month
Only one main product + upsells
It's a brand, not dropshipping

2) I'd go with test one product for more time. It's unlikely to get a product to "stick" to the wall if you just throw them randomly. I'd invest more time in each product, making it better. Working on the offer, angle, creatives, etc
[30.11.23, 21:32:42] ~ Dr Tim: Oboy!!! Amazing numbers! I love the mindset and approach!! Thanks for sharing @⁨~Santi Roa⁩
[30.11.23, 21:52:39] ~ Haroon: But in the beginning it was just dropshipping ? Did you have great roas from the get go?
[30.11.23, 22:44:36] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team! As you know 1 good creative can change your business 

But once you milk it for a few months and it starts to fatigue - you get that crackhead-like itch to find a new banger lol

Long story short: my team faced the exact same issue with one of our brands a few months ago 

And right around that time I joined @⁨~Anvar⁩ program that has helped us systemize creative testing, speed up the production process, and finally churn out  new winners that got us back to scaling.

Right now he’s running a Black Friday deal which is only available to his newsletter

But knowing how valuable it is - I asked him to give access to our ESS community.

[1.12.23, 8:59:07] ~ G M: Thank you
[1.12.23, 11:14:57] ~ Maxi: Guys is it possible to change the language on shopifys order notification and shipping updates without changing the complete language of the the whole store
[1.12.23, 13:02:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hi guys

Did custom labeling/packaging, own photos/GIFs give a big boost to your store?
[1.12.23, 13:03:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Im testing something new right now, and want to give it all a trustworthy look & feel. Im thinking about some custom photos/gifs with custom packaging, trying to get my supplier to do like 20 pcs so i can send them out to content creators
[1.12.23, 13:42:27] ~ Haroon: When you guys test multiple angles for picture ads, do you just change ad copy?

And for video ads also ad copy or just different hook but same copy?
[1.12.23, 13:45:47] ~ Haroon: Y’all would help a lot, thanks!
[1.12.23, 13:46:05] ~ Luka: If it's a product in the testing phase, can test without. If it's a winner, imo it's a no-brainer to get custom label/packaging, own photos/gifs, assets etc.
[1.12.23, 13:46:29] ~ Luka: Plus these assets are assets you can use for years
[1.12.23, 14:02:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thanks!

[2.12.23, 6:43:31] ~ G M: Are you using agency accounts?
[2.12.23, 6:51:42] ~ Franco: Does anyone know how to take down a copycat on FB? Copycat ripped our ads on FB, literally 1 for 1, and just blurred our watermark and put theirs on. We’ve submitted multiple DMCA on FB and they never got back to us. Anyone know a solution?
[2.12.23, 6:52:22] Yaniv: Do you have a rep assigned? they should be helpful for this.
[2.12.23, 6:52:56] ~ Franco: Nah how do you get an assigned rep?
[2.12.23, 6:53:21] Yaniv: They assign it to you
[2.12.23, 6:53:27] Yaniv: When the time comes
[2.12.23, 6:53:53] ~ Franco: Oh dam ok
[2.12.23, 7:06:30] ~ Sang: my be ROAS is really low, around 1.17
[2.12.23, 7:06:54] ~ Sang: I have my own agency now lol
[2.12.23, 7:08:36] ~ Dr Tim: Please anyone running ads in the UK market?

1. What's average CPM?

2. What's your target CPC?
[2.12.23, 7:09:46] ~ Dr Tim: @⁨~David B⁩ boss any tips?
[2.12.23, 9:29:41] ~ Pavel in HK: *SINGAPORE* anybody in Singapore want to meet up? I will be in SG tomorrow (Sunday) evening
[2.12.23, 9:30:59] ~ lengjoo: how long will you be there for? sadly will only be back in SG on the 16th dec
[2.12.23, 9:33:17] ~ Pavel in HK: around 16th dec I will be in Hong Kong. let's try next time
[2.12.23, 10:41:42] ~ Nim: Is anyone running subscriptions though funnelish? 
Once ppl subscribe to a product, how are their details handled going forwards, I.e they want to cancel or have X products/mo. 
Is it done in funnelish backend or payment processor backend? 
With shopify if I used recharge app, can funnelish subscription data be linked to this - then handled in the app?
[2.12.23, 12:26:39] ~ Haroon: Tiktok organic: how often can you max post in one day with one account to not limit reach? 

Goal is 10 PCs content a day, split between multiple accs or stay with one? I can hit 1000 followers faster staying with one. Someone experienced here?
[2.12.23, 13:16:18] ~ David B: Depends on the product and industry. What niche are you in @⁨~Dr Tim⁩ ?
[2.12.23, 13:23:55] ~ Malik: Hey guys do you do something when you have this message on failed payments on Funnelish
[2.12.23, 13:24:01] ~ Malik: Normally I don't have a lot but today 3 in a row
‎[2.12.23, 13:24:05] ~ Malik: ‎image omitted
[2.12.23, 13:24:06] ~ Malik: I have Stripe
[2.12.23, 13:24:13] ~ Malik: Or there is nothing we can do about it ?
[2.12.23, 13:25:22] ~ RS: The customer failed to do 2FA authentification probably. Happens to me every day for some customers
[2.12.23, 14:31:10] ~ Dr Tim: Pain relief niche.
[2.12.23, 14:38:12] ~ Rajat Grover: 13-14 pounds

and CPC is 0.50 - 0.80
[2.12.23, 14:39:11] ~ David B: Okay. 

I don't have all the info memorised. 

But the average cpm for the UK market is around £5 I think. That's about $7. 

CPM is cheaper in the UK but US usually gets a higher CTR. 

I recommend checking out AdEspresso and Statista. They have a ton of info on thos sort of data. 

Hope that helps.
[2.12.23, 14:39:57] ~ David B: Also, you can tell from my typos that I can't text for sh*t lol.
[2.12.23, 14:40:20] ~ Dr Tim: Thank you.

I have something to measure against.
[2.12.23, 14:40:32] ~ Dr Tim: I'd take it lol 😂 😂
[2.12.23, 14:41:29] ~ Dr Tim: Oh wow. £13-14 is like $18... Seems high.

What niche is this please?

[3.12.23, 20:28:37] ~ Ecomcesar: i have tried integrating klaviyo with Funnelish and i have got my abandoned customers list from Funnelish integrated with klaviyo but the SMS authorization form customers is not enable so I cant send them recovery SMSs

While running new products on completely fresh pixels =>

let's say our budget is $10 per day and sometimes we get order at $4 the very first day and for next 2 days 0 orders

but the same product is working well for others


so how should we deal with this situation?
[4.12.23, 11:03:46] ~ Luka: Does anyone have access to Apple's internal customer support/sales training manual? Or from
[4.12.23, 11:03:53] ~ Luka: or from any other company with fantastic customer support
[4.12.23, 11:24:56] ~ Chris Koh: Thats weird as we haven't seen this as a common issue, so we hope to hear more from you my friend
[4.12.23, 12:03:20] ~ Santi Roa: Hey Chris! It was the internet and 5g signal that went down on our town
My entire acquisition team was at the office with me, and we all freaked out. The pages were all broken... then we called other employees and they were fine. We had about 20 minutes of crazyness, and then we became clear that the problem was our wifi😬

[4.12.23, 12:20:12] ~ Luka: https://www.voomly.com/ Seems like Russell Brunson is doing some pretty interesting things with Voomly that can be used for ecom. List building, interactive video, video funnel and so on. Thought I'd share

[4.12.23, 14:39:42] ~ David: Anyone expert in creating Hong Kong companies here?
[4.12.23, 14:46:40] ~ Pavel in HK: I’m not an expert lol but let me see if I can help in anyway. 
Opening a company in Hong Kong is quite easy. The most difficult part is to open a bank account.
[4.12.23, 14:46:56] ~ Pavel in HK: I will be in Hong Kong next week
[4.12.23, 14:47:02] ~ David: Just wrote you in DM
[4.12.23, 15:31:36] ~ Maxi: I think HK companies is pretty much straight forward including bank account bro

https://getstarted.hk


They form the company for you and open airwallex aswell 


Don’t buy into the 5-10k  company setups that some guys offer
[4.12.23, 15:33:23] ~ Suraj Singh: I opened using sleek/hk
[4.12.23, 15:35:58] ~ Suraj Singh: Hey guys, any contact for HK return filing?

[4.12.23, 15:46:07] ~ Pavel in HK: https://startupregistry.hk/services/
[4.12.23, 16:08:54] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: If I want to have a sales page for the different countries with different languages under the same domain, how do I do that? So lets say I have a .com domain and I want to use this store and domain for Germany, the US and France but I want all the pages to be in their respective language.
[4.12.23, 16:16:28] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Anyone's having a company in Cyprus? And living there?
[4.12.23, 16:20:43] ~ Suraj Singh: Thanks man!

[4.12.23, 16:22:49] ~ Suraj Singh: For me, it's PayPal mainly. Easy scaling, was able to release holds with a phone call. Easy to increase limits as well.

[4.12.23, 16:53:41] ~ Y: If you have a stripe account in one region and selling into another region, then you will have low authentication rate from stripe (or similar gateways), best place to have a stripe account for highest possible authorization rate would be the US. Are you using Stripe? Can you share more details would me pls
[4.12.23, 18:18:57] ~ Mohammed-amine: For those of you shipping stock from China to US. How much are you being quoted per kg DDP?

[4.12.23, 22:40:48] ~ Tarlan: They are many failed payments by same person in a raw. It usually means it’s the issue on customer side. I’m using Stripe and it’s been okay for me.

[4.12.23, 23:22:02] ~ David: Anyone here knows best alternatives to stripe to integrate with shopify?
[4.12.23, 23:23:18] ~ Ecomcesar: checkout.com

[4.12.23, 23:23:48] ~ Maxi: You need like atleast 1-2M in revenue per month
[4.12.23, 23:23:53] ~ Maxi: For checkout.com
[4.12.23, 23:23:54] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yes
[4.12.23, 23:23:54] ~ Ecomcesar: any contact to open a checkout account? as it is an alternative to stripe in Funnelihs?
[4.12.23, 23:24:00] ~ Ecomcesar: fro those who sell in USA
[4.12.23, 23:24:48] ~ Tarlan: Can I transfer money in different currencies? I’m trying to avoid currency exchange fees.
[4.12.23, 23:27:34] ~ Mike Ramsey: Can only be your base currency (domestic sales) to avoid currency conversion fees.  The ‘blue devil’ wants their money either in a withdrawal fee or currency conversion fee.
[4.12.23, 23:28:25] ~ Mike Ramsey: I have connections to CKO accounts and lower minimum processing levels for US.  Feel free to PM and we can review.
[4.12.23, 23:28:57] ~ Maxi: Whats your entry processing level ?
[4.12.23, 23:30:57] ~ Tarlan: So no way around it :/ Thank you!
[4.12.23, 23:31:58] ~ Mike Ramsey: 3k monthly fee minimum which is about ~150k month processing volume
[4.12.23, 23:37:16] ~ Maxi: Thats amazing, better than the 1M I’ve heard
[4.12.23, 23:40:26] ~ L: Guys have you noticed the issues with the Shopify checkout to be fixed (the ones when it switched to 1 page) ?
[4.12.23, 23:41:39] ~ Mike Ramsey: Depends on region and contact but that is higher than what we have negotiated as a partner
[5.12.23, 4:50:20] ~ seth: I'm currently facing challenges with the fail rate on both Stripe US and UK. Normally, the fail rate is acceptable, but over the past 5-6 days, it has significantly increased. This, coupled with tracking issues on Facebook, is putting us in a difficult situation.
[5.12.23, 5:01:16] ~ Y: Can you pm me some samples of the failed transactions on stripe and the reason stripe shows for failure
[5.12.23, 5:15:02] ~ seth: sure bro
[5.12.23, 6:26:19] ~ seth: hi guys what is your meta video creative ratio? I'm usually go with 3x4 because we have a lot of short form content but after update it's not work well anymore CPM got high even with old winning hook.
[5.12.23, 6:35:47] ~ Sang: https://www.instagram.com/p/C0YEWvZoi4E/?img_index=1
[5.12.23, 9:35:28] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Best bet is to create different virtual cards on Wise, connect then to Paypal and assign them different currencies. This way you will pay only 1% fee to transfer from Paypal to use and then convert to USD on Wise. I think there are no better ways
[5.12.23, 9:35:50] ~ Alessandro Sassi: But not all currencies are supported
[5.12.23, 10:32:12] ~ Maxi: Guys whats currently a good platform for UGC content sourcing ?
[5.12.23, 11:36:31] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Congratulations on those amazing results @⁨~Santi Roa⁩, I’m Curious what are your margins looking like?
[5.12.23, 11:49:16] ~ Marko: Does anyone have recommendations for agency accounts with a quick turnaround time? Our current one keeps delaying and we need to be quick
[5.12.23, 11:49:18] ~ Santi Roa: 25% ish. Sometimes 30, sometimes 20, I haven't closed my books for Nov
[5.12.23, 11:51:56] ~ Gordon: You can try adtiger. usually takes between 1-2 days to open a new account but I’ve even gotten some on the same day before
[5.12.23, 11:53:41] ~ Alessandro Sassi: That's an impressive margin on that scale
[5.12.23, 12:21:02] ~ Malik: Something must be happening with Funnelish and Stripe. All year almost no failed payements and now I have some each days. In different markets
[5.12.23, 12:21:49] ~ RS: Do you have EU stripe?
[5.12.23, 12:26:23] ~ Malik: Yes
[5.12.23, 12:32:02] ~ RS: I have EU stripe and I have payment declines every day for 4 years already. Some days more, some days less. USA payments are declined most often. It is USA banks declining the card for security purposes because if you have EU stripe, it is an international payment. In these cases we always tell in Tidio chat customers to call their bank, or we send email explaining why card was declined, and ask to call their bank. 30-50% of the people actually call their bank and after that they can successfully place the order. UJ payments are declined very rarely but they still occur. Also for UK payments customers need to call their bank. 
New Zealand payments are never declined. Australia payments are declined very rarely. 

Also, check in stripe what is the cause of decline. Maybe it is not a bank decline, but maybe it is because customers cannot complete the 3DS Secure authentification asked by their bank. 
And in funnelish it often happens for UK customers (same if you target EU countries).
[5.12.23, 12:34:34] ~ RS: Also, I had my payments declined in sholify very often since one page checkout came out. I then switched off address autocomplete in checkout, so customers need to enter their Shipping address manually. It reduced decline rate by 80-90% instantly. 
Also, in funnelish I dont have address auto-completion. And above the payment field I inform customers to not use card detail auto-fill. I ask them to manually enter card details. Auto-filling card details Also can cause declines.
[5.12.23, 12:35:57] ~ RS: Now, I still have 2-5 payments declines every day doing 6-8k/day but Im Okay with that.
[5.12.23, 13:19:50] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Good tips, thanks
[5.12.23, 13:26:57] ~ RS: Anybody use Airwallex payment gateway+funnelish?
[5.12.23, 13:53:57] ~ Maxi: I dont think that works... funnelish is limiting.

You can use NMI and maybe link airwallex to that ?

Other than that its only stripe, checkout.com and mollie
[5.12.23, 13:54:38] ~ Malik: I see @⁨~RS⁩ Thank you a lot !
[5.12.23, 13:55:06] ~ Malik: I think it's 3DS Secure did you resolve it ?
[5.12.23, 14:04:04] ~ RS: In stripe it should show not “failed” in red, but “incomplete” in gray, if the payment is not completed because of 3ds
[5.12.23, 14:04:59] ~ RS: Nope. Talked with funnelish support many times, periodically sending them emails of customers who told me that they cannot complete 3ds, because they dont Get redirected back to website after completing 3ds
[5.12.23, 14:05:10] ~ RS: They are still working on it
[5.12.23, 14:06:16] ~ RS: Funnelish said that it can be done with integrating via API but it needs developers work. Maybe somebody has done it and has developers Contacts who have done the integration

[5.12.23, 19:49:41] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Why does Stripe not show up as an option on Shopify when trying to add payment providers in the US, I have a Swedish LLC but it has worked for Netherland, Finland, Norway etc.
[5.12.23, 20:33:22] ~ RS: When I used USA stripe, then I switched store’s country to some European country. Then it allowed ti add stripe. I added my stripe and then changed location back to USA.
[5.12.23, 20:34:26] ~ RS: So if your store’s location is USA, change it to sweden for example. Add your stripe and then change location to Usa again. Try this, it worked for me in the last
[5.12.23, 20:35:49] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Worked, thanks!
[5.12.23, 20:36:10] ~ RS: Great, youre welcome
[5.12.23, 20:37:00] ~ David: anyone here tried Stripe Atlas?
[5.12.23, 22:32:35] ~ Natasha Iris: Since failed payments has been a hot topic lately, particularly through Funnelish we are going to focus on this tomorrow on our payments call!

For anyone selling to the US, but operating in other regions / processing through entity outside of US, there are ways you can unlock a local acquiring account to recover failed payments and also reduce cross border fees within Funnelish.

In addition, we will hit on benchmark auth rates for each core region - US, EU, UK so you can see where you stack up against averages in the industry.

[5.12.23, 23:50:49] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team! For those of you doing under $100k/mo, I'm creating a NEW fire module from scratch. What's your #1 obstacle to scaling past $100k/mo right now?

[6.12.23, 5:13:22] ~ lengjoo: anyone ever gotten their support email suspended for spam? It happens like once a month for us, so annoying..
[6.12.23, 5:17:08] ~ lengjoo: from gsuite*
[6.12.23, 5:28:34] ~ Iskander Zrouga: So annoying!! I fixed it by disabling some “spam filtering rules”
[6.12.23, 6:29:18] ~ Haroon: Does anyone have a tax consultant in Germany that he can share who also has capacity? All tax consultants have no capacity. Hit me up
[6.12.23, 6:35:46] ~ Tarlan: @⁨~Alessandro Sassi⁩ that will save me a lot of money, Thanks bro!
[6.12.23, 8:46:34] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Creatives. Maybe also non optimal margins
[6.12.23, 10:06:21] ~ Maxi: Guys, how many customer support team members would you suggest for a monthly revenue of around 800k-1M ?

Im looking to improve the customer support - currently we are at two team members + Gorgias APP
[6.12.23, 10:29:47] ~ lengjoo: ahh i’ll look into that thanks! ‎<This message was edited>
[6.12.23, 10:30:26] ~ lengjoo: optimise first response rate and total resolution time, can track on gorgias
[6.12.23, 10:30:39] ~ lengjoo: bring first response down to <2 hours would be nice
[6.12.23, 10:33:56] ~ Maxi: How many team members do you have ?
[6.12.23, 10:34:57] ~ lengjoo: when at 1m/month we had 4?
[6.12.23, 10:35:02] ~ lengjoo: about there
[6.12.23, 10:36:31] ~ Maxi: And what kind of tasks did they have ?

Did each one of them managed tickets and phone calls or was one of them the head of CS
[6.12.23, 13:00:42] ~ L: Guys, is it true that the French market is becoming more and more skeptical every year due to ecom scammers? 

Have any of you scaled or are currently scaling an ecommerce business there?
[6.12.23, 13:07:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Im getting some messages from people that are getting kicked from Klarna lately, anyone here experienced this?
[6.12.23, 13:10:09] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: My Facebook Account just got restricted out of nowhere, no restricted ads or nothing for over 2-3 months. Anyone got a Facebook I could get in touch with or do you guys have a solution for this?
[6.12.23, 13:10:36] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Facebook Rep*
[6.12.23, 13:21:02] ~ Maxi: It depends how you present yourself aswell 

Sceptical towards Dropshipping Shopify stores with a little branding ? 

- a 100% 

Since the Chinese got access to all those EU payment setups with HK companies including Klarna etc. Their stores are like a cockroach infestation 

They have been in French market for many years what caused this scepticism you mentioned and now they are in Germany and Dutch also
[6.12.23, 13:40:34] ~ L: Ok thank you @⁨~Maxi⁩ 

What do you think is the best way to deal with it? 
Is a good branding enough? What do you recommend?
[6.12.23, 13:41:40] ~ lengjoo: mixed, some of them have side tasks like posting on social media, etc but main task is answering tickets
[6.12.23, 13:42:27] ~ Maxi: Standing out with proper branding and custom ads is more than enough
[6.12.23, 15:02:59] ~ Luka: Not sure about France specifically, but we sell in Asia in a country that's filled with low quality sellers & a lot of people hesitant to shop anywhere outside the local Amazon equivalent. Here's how we solved it. Some are less powerful, some more:

- Real user reviews (not UGC reviews). But boring old low quality camera reviews from REAL customers
- 100% unique assets (website, videos, imagery, custom 3D animations, custom 2-3 minute sales video where we interview 2 people & their experience etc)
- Real, verified reviews
- Good quality IG with reviews in your highlights, custom imagery etc
- Legit social proof. Pay for news listings rather than just putting a fake quote. People google and verify it.
- Make the offer really good (bonuses, free shipping, returns, money-back guarantee etc)
- 100% custom filmed ads, no stealing content (they've already seen it)
- If it makes sense, show the label of your product. Highlight reviews where the photo contains a label of your brand

For example, https://purple.com/purple-grid right away you know this brand is legit cause of it's websites, high quality assets, high perceived value, tons of verified reviews etc.
[6.12.23, 15:04:01] ~ Luka: In your live recordings of your website, when there is a person doing nothing for a few minutes, often times they're Googling your brand - have that covered too
[6.12.23, 15:05:49] ~ Luka: Even smaller things... like if you have a security certificate, make it clickable (with a popup to prevent them them leaving) showing the certificate, and stuff like that. These are small things but 5 small things that add 3% boost in sales each, is already a +15% boost in your conversion rate.
[6.12.23, 15:44:58] ~ Maxi: Has anyone has the issue that for orders imported via funnelish to shopify the wrong order notification is being sent out ?

Our stores main language is german, we enabled the english language as secondary but still each order get a german notification instead of English one for the people who order from a english speaking country

[6.12.23, 20:10:46] ~ RS: Yeah
[6.12.23, 20:11:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ok so just adding a product and then link the button to "OTO - yes" is good?
[6.12.23, 20:11:42] ~ RS: Yes
[6.12.23, 20:13:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ok good, thanks
[6.12.23, 21:15:11] ~ Lareina: Hi everyone- do you charge the customers re-shipping fee when they put the wrong address and the package is returned and needs to reship? How does that play out since they can just ask for the refund? 

And if you do, how do you charge them- by sending invoices?
[6.12.23, 21:25:34] ~ Kamal: We just reship it for free. It’s a small % of customers
[6.12.23, 22:00:07] ~ Lareina: Make sense!@⁨~Kamal⁩
[6.12.23, 22:14:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: is it possible to get a "paypal express checkout" on funnelish? 

I see some people just scrolling past the section where they need to fill in their info and just click straight on paypal, when everything turns red because they didnt fill it in, they just leave.

[7.12.23, 11:17:08] ~ Alessandro Sassi: How does this compare to foreplay.co?
[7.12.23, 12:06:20] ~ Santi Roa: I don't think so, because they are required by the FDIC to show proof that their customers have US operations
[7.12.23, 12:06:52] ~ Santi Roa: I spoke with a contact I have about that because I was on the same situation
[7.12.23, 12:40:33] ~ Alejandro H.: So you included a US adress right?  How did you solved it?
[7.12.23, 14:56:05] ~ Kevin Krieg: Looks amazing. Using foreplay for this, but cool stuff.

Dies gethooked also allow specificall, saving landers? Thats one thing foreplay cant do (yet) that id love to have
[7.12.23, 16:37:07] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For people selling in germany, what works best for you regarding offers? 

Discount % or 1+1/2+2 free? (ofcourse it has to make sense to buy multiple)
[7.12.23, 16:37:56] ~ Maxi: Discount % , where the 50% is max.
[7.12.23, 16:38:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: oh really, interesting. Why not above 50? credibility?
[7.12.23, 17:10:45] ~ Kamal: Hmm I have the same question
[7.12.23, 17:52:52] ~ Rajat Grover: I believe FB doesn't allow more than 50%  as it consider it as spam!
[7.12.23, 18:24:35] ~ Tarlan: Is it okay to offer same product as a first upsell for more discounted price in Germany?
[7.12.23, 18:28:49] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So 50% is max or is it 49 then? Hahah
[7.12.23, 18:29:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And if you have higher percentages then it can affect cpms or something?
[7.12.23, 18:30:13] ~ Tarlan: Single product is 50% and I have extra discount on bundles up to 60-65%. Should I lower all discounts to show max of 50%?
[7.12.23, 18:50:51] ~ Maxi: No not because of FB

Because of German mentality, they tend to see something as suspicious or too good to be true when it’s more than 50% off 

I did a split test from 50% up to 70% off 

vs 30% up to 50% off and the cheaper discount was better.

Same price but just the discount was different
[7.12.23, 18:51:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Great, thanks for the advice 🙌
[7.12.23, 18:52:55] ~ Maxi: But split test for yourself, it’s just my individual experience for my offer
[7.12.23, 18:53:44] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Will do. I checked some good running German shops and they Indeed all use <50% discount
[7.12.23, 18:56:12] ~ Maxi: Also uneven numbers work good 

26% 
33% 
42%

[7.12.23, 21:36:17] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Awesome!
[8.12.23, 0:41:17] ~ RS: Does anyone know what may cause misrepresentation on Google Merchant Centre?

I’ve gone through the website and Google account many times and still can’t find what causes that. I have appealed many times already with no success.

The name of the business in Merchant Centre matches the name of the website, contact information provided in the footer and on the contact us page, privacy policy, t&c, shipping policy, refund/return policy, FAQs, full company information, and VAT. High-quality designed website, SSL certificate, and products are synced from Shopify with Google Merchant Centre, including valid GTIN numbers and full information.



Where to look? It should be something really simple, as they finish the appeal within a few hours, informing them that they still found misrepresentation.

I know that here someone had sent an e-mail to contact for shopify for fake DMCA, I have a friend who would need it.

I can't find it in the conversation

Could you please send me the e-mail again?
[8.12.23, 14:00:41] ~ Jeremy Leppink: hi! 

My funnelish checkout % is fairly low.
Any must-haves on the checkout for germany? 

Or does a shopify checkout work better maybe?
[8.12.23, 14:16:12] ~ Y: Klarna, paypal, credit card payment options, if it’s lower than your shopify send me links to both and funnel analytics and will review the funnel for you
[8.12.23, 14:16:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I didnt test shopify checkout yet, went straight with funnelish

[11.12.23, 0:24:42] ~ Tarlan: https://www.fiverr.com/al_faysal/design-shopify-ecommerce-website-with-pagefly-gempages-zipify-or-shogun?utm_source=16787&utm_medium=cx_affiliate&utm_campaign=2075099&afp=b00f28cd4b10d6355fb8c4e37296ac26&cxd_token=16787_30499867_b00f28cd4b10d6355fb8c4e37296ac26&show_join=true&source=order_page_summary_gig_link_image&funnel=410e31e0fd8e93bd840aa0e43d2afb74
[11.12.23, 0:25:20] ~ Tarlan: He built my Funnelish Product page with Gempages and he did a pretty good job.
[11.12.23, 1:14:39] ~ Bryan T: I'll check him out thanks!
[11.12.23, 1:36:09] ~ Kyle Twohill: any of yall know a fast way to transcribe a VSL
[11.12.23, 1:37:43] ~ Dr Tim: It's been recommended to send it to yourself on Slack
[11.12.23, 1:39:12] ~ Ecomcesar: Anyone has a good freelancer who can built very good advertorials ?
[11.12.23, 1:39:15] ~ Ecomcesar: Appreciate a lot
[11.12.23, 1:39:46] ~ Malik: Cockatoo
[11.12.23, 1:39:54] ~ Dr Tim: https://tinywow.com/video/audio-to-text

Also used this personal. If the video is not super long, it works well.
[11.12.23, 1:39:56] ~ Valentin Ursu: https://app.notta.ai
This is pretty quick and accurate
[11.12.23, 1:40:10] ~ Kyle Twohill: thanks!!
[11.12.23, 4:12:29] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you guys have a cheaper alternative to  triple whale for daily profit tracking? I dont need their attribution data just for tracking costs etc
[11.12.23, 9:34:12] ~ Malik: ProfitCalc
[11.12.23, 9:57:05] ~ Alessandro Sassi: TrueProfit
[11.12.23, 10:50:38] ~ Tim Alleraun: ProfitCalc
[11.12.23, 11:20:35] ~ Memed: Anyone using mollie?
[11.12.23, 12:08:41] ~ Kevin Krieg: Yea we are
[11.12.23, 12:10:52] ~ Memed: Are you guys satisfied with them? Any issues so far?
[11.12.23, 12:12:11] ~ Kevin Krieg: Very satisfied. Rates are cheaper than shopify payments and very good support, dashboard, backend... very happy with them
[11.12.23, 12:13:11] ~ Memed: thankyou Kevin! appreciate the respond, will check them out
[11.12.23, 12:13:51] ~ Memed: you use klarna trough there aswell?
[11.12.23, 12:14:17] ~ Kevin Krieg: To be fair, they are only cheaper on shopify plus because shopify only takes 0.1% for 3rd party payment processors on that plan. For lower plans, 3rd party is always gonna be more expensive because of shopifys cut
[11.12.23, 12:14:22] ~ Kevin Krieg: Ye
[11.12.23, 12:15:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is it just me or is funnelish checkout not working
[11.12.23, 12:16:43] ~ RS: What exactly?
[11.12.23, 12:16:49] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I launched some VSLs and got crazy results, last week all week i had a 14% average on my checkout.

Now after 52 people on checkout not even 1
[11.12.23, 12:17:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Not even 1 failed payment
[11.12.23, 12:17:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Yesterday it worked fine still
[11.12.23, 12:17:29] ~ RS: Maybe just a bad traffic. Today Im at 10% losses. Usually 20-30% profit
[11.12.23, 12:17:41] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Yeah I just created my whole funnelish page on Shopify with GemPages, now no problems with checkout.
[11.12.23, 12:17:42] ~ RS: Do you have Microsoft clarity set up?
[11.12.23, 12:18:12] ~ RS: Not a single optin as well?
[11.12.23, 12:19:57] ~ Alessandro Sassi: today I am at  -60% loss lol, usually 20-30% profit too
[11.12.23, 12:22:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: no, super weird hahah
[11.12.23, 12:22:44] ~ Jeremy Leppink: and i just checked my VSLs that started running today
[11.12.23, 12:23:04] ~ Jeremy Leppink: and they look fire
[11.12.23, 12:24:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i have microsoft clarity yes, i checked a handfull recordings
[11.12.23, 12:24:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: they just dont do anything, bit weird
[11.12.23, 12:24:48] ~ RS: You should set up Microsoft clarity in your funnels. So you could check your users behavior. Usually, when I have a very bad day, I think its because of some funnelish glitches, but when I check with clarity, user that there are no glitches. Just a poor traffic. They even make optins, add address, but leave the website after that.
[11.12.23, 12:25:31] ~ RS: I think its just a very bad day for you man. Days like this happen. Stay composed, it will work out in the evening
[11.12.23, 12:25:45] ~ RS: How much are you spending in ads per day currently?
[11.12.23, 12:25:49] ~ Santi Roa: That's a huge difference, how many winning creatives do you have running atm in your account? How much spent in % to each of these?
[11.12.23, 12:25:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 300 a day starting today
[11.12.23, 12:26:00] ~ Santi Roa: Maybe you are relying too much in one creative
[11.12.23, 12:26:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: yesterday it was a 100
[11.12.23, 12:26:08] ~ RS: Its a very very Little adspend.
[11.12.23, 12:26:13] ~ Luka: And is it your only campaign running?
[11.12.23, 12:26:39] ~ RS: Probably, previous days with your lowe budget FB found you a super profitable audience. And then switched pools
[11.12.23, 12:26:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: jeah for sure, was just surprised because the avarage of last week was good on the lower spend
[11.12.23, 12:26:47] ~ RS: You cannot Get consistant days with such low budget bro
[11.12.23, 12:26:47] ~ Jeremy Leppink: could be could be
[11.12.23, 12:27:06] ~ Luka: Judge results based on 3 / 7 days rather than 1 day
[11.12.23, 12:27:11] ~ RS: The same happened to me when I spent less than 500$ a day for my product. Some days 7 roas, the next day 0.5 roas
[11.12.23, 12:27:23] ~ Santi Roa: Yeah if you were spending 100 day and suddenly took it to 300 it's too much imo
[11.12.23, 12:27:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: as long as the average is good hahah
[11.12.23, 12:27:36] ~ Jeremy Leppink: its 200 for 10 new VSL variants
[11.12.23, 12:27:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 20 a adset
[11.12.23, 12:27:44] ~ Jeremy Leppink: the 100 was on photos
[11.12.23, 12:28:44] ~ RS: Yeah to its still just testing. In testing phase results can vary day by day. You will Get some consistency when You start scaling with cbo etc. So its totally normal, just keep testing and scale what works
[11.12.23, 12:28:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: allright, thanks
[11.12.23, 13:43:30] ~ Marko: Are you using triple whale?
[11.12.23, 13:43:42] ~ Marko: I suddenly don’t have the option anymore either
[11.12.23, 13:43:49] ~ Marko: That’s the only thing I changed..
[11.12.23, 14:11:31] ~ Peter: I didn’t change anything, but still yesterday it glitched out on me too
[11.12.23, 14:18:04] ~ Dr Tim: I am not sure what is going on. I've sent over 500 clicks to my funnel and more than 60 of them hit my checkout page but no single purchase.

$400 spent. No conversion. No error on Stripe. Nothing. I'm using Stripe and PayPal checkout on funnelish. None had reported any error
[11.12.23, 14:19:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I have the same but i think its poor quality traffic though
[11.12.23, 14:19:44] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ill just let it play out and optimize
[11.12.23, 14:23:32] ~ Dr Tim: How do you determine poor traffic? I'm targeting UK. Across 3 ad accounts. It is not probable that all will be poor traffic.

Also, 100+ traffic is statistically significant.

Over 500 unique clicks across 3 ad accounts?
[11.12.23, 14:28:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: what is the opt in rate
[11.12.23, 14:29:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: for me they all land on checkout and then dont do anything, while before i have a average of 14% on checkout, so i thought its weird too. But its not the payments for me, its just the people coming on my checkout just leave. (so that sounds like bad traffic to me)
[11.12.23, 14:32:35] ~ Marko: Are you checking out from the UK? Sometimes people can’t select the right market. I had lots of traffic from Turkey and they weren’t able to checkout because that market wasn’t active
[11.12.23, 14:33:12] ~ Dr Tim: I'm sure it's UK. It's exclusively UK targeting
[11.12.23, 14:33:47] ~ Marko: Yeah, I mean the checkout. Can you place an order when filling out uk details

‎[11.12.23, 14:35:48] ~ Dr Tim: ‎image omitted
[11.12.23, 14:36:01] ~ Dr Tim: those are 3 duplicated funnels running traffic from 3 ad accounts.
[11.12.23, 14:44:37] ~ Dr Tim: I just did, payment declined -- didn't show on Stripe.
[11.12.23, 14:45:25] ~ Marko: So that’s it
[11.12.23, 14:49:06] ~ Dr Tim: What solution do you recommend?
[11.12.23, 14:50:59] ~ Marko: I have no idea, but at least now you’re sure that’s the problem. You should try to look into the settings. In shopify it’s because a specific market isn’t active but I’m not sure about funnelish.
[11.12.23, 14:53:18] ~ Dr Tim: I do have PayPal. You'd think someone would have tried PayPal?
[11.12.23, 14:53:43] ~ Marko: Does Ppal work when checking out with UK details?
[11.12.23, 14:54:33] ~ Dr Tim: Hmm, I should try that.
[11.12.23, 16:19:06] ~ Malik: Anyone has a Google Sheet or Notion template to follow creative performances ? I started testing a lot and it's time to track. Or maybe do you use an online tool ? Thank you
[11.12.23, 16:20:06] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Looking for the same
[11.12.23, 16:36:09] ~ Alessandro Sassi: https://motionapp.com/
[11.12.23, 16:36:38] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Recommended by a coach here
[11.12.23, 17:19:55] ~ Malik: Thx !
[11.12.23, 23:55:14] Matán Intsuper: Hey guys. I’m losing around 98% of my disputes lol, even when I’m right and I have the evidence (I lost a product not received dispute while I had an image of the product at the doorstep). Anyone has a good solution / document on solving disputes?

What do you do in a case of a dispute saying ‘product unacceptable’ and customer never contacted you?
[11.12.23, 23:58:12] Marek Olszewski: you’re most likely not providing enough evindence, put everything into a single pdf, order page, transcation info, proof of communication/lack of response from the customer, POD, tracking number
[12.12.23, 1:34:30] ~ Kyle Twohill: what is the best shopify subscriptions app
[12.12.23, 3:31:36] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Recharge @⁨~Kyle Twohill⁩
[12.12.23, 3:36:35] ~ Mike Ramsey: Have you looked into RDR or Ethoca alerts?  That willl help drastically reduce losses and allows you to refund and handle disputes more amicably.  Visa is also rolling out compelling evidence solutions in 2024 that will help bring more ‘wins’ to merchant as CB’s are heavily favored towards consumers.  If you need any guidance on chargeback management feel free to PM me.
[12.12.23, 5:06:33] ~ seth: same
[12.12.23, 5:07:10] ~ Dr Tim: Overall 99 visitors hit my checkout page.

No single conversion
[12.12.23, 5:07:17] ~ seth: first time $300 and not a single sale
[12.12.23, 5:07:36] ~ seth: you running target or broad?
[12.12.23, 5:32:40] ~ Dr Tim: Target UK. 10 Adsets.

Then another account Broad.
[12.12.23, 6:40:45] ~ Dr Tim: If you're testing a new product, how much is the max you spend before deciding to get on to the next if its not converting?
[12.12.23, 10:46:37] ~ RS: Hey! If someone knows some good resources, courses etc. for native ads (especially Taboola), please let me know. I have used taboola in the past, I know the standard things about it, but my ads are always shown in cheap placements so traffic is bad.
[12.12.23, 10:48:02] Topi: Do you have clarity installed to check recordings?
[12.12.23, 11:32:41] ~ Tim Alleraun: Does anyone know any good fulfillment companies based in Germany? Thanks!
[12.12.23, 13:41:36] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I just started selling in germany and i have a winner, but germany is paypal heavy and my paypal (for some reason, this account is already 3+ years old) can only do 3700 in revenue each month (the rest they want to hold)
[12.12.23, 13:41:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: is there any way on how to get this up quickly?
[12.12.23, 13:42:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: like they just send me a mail with "congratulations, you can now withdraw 3700 instead of 2800" 😂
[12.12.23, 13:43:40] ~ RS: I process in PayPal over 70k a month and I had only 14k available every month 😀 I think there is no way to Get limits up faster. But they will increase the limit every month if you dont have many disputes
[12.12.23, 13:44:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Man thats hard on the cashflow 😂
[12.12.23, 13:44:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Amex for the win i guess
[12.12.23, 13:45:02] ~ RS: Jap it is😀 I reach this limit in 1 week. So I try to ship out all PayPal orders the same day so the hold gets released in ~10 days not 21 days
[12.12.23, 13:45:26] ~ Jeremy Leppink: thats smart indeed, does a automatic tracking system help?
[12.12.23, 13:45:37] ~ L: From my experience PayPal is not really a problem as long as you upload tracking numbers for every order and you answer customers quickly when they open a dispute.

They went from 3k to 5k and the. straight to 21k a month .
[12.12.23, 13:45:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: so that it all gets updated automtically in paypal
[12.12.23, 13:45:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: right
[12.12.23, 13:45:54] ~ Allan L: Any good apps for splittesting product pages? Using Shopify with PageFly atm.
[12.12.23, 13:48:03] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Do you have Klarna?
[12.12.23, 13:49:52] ~ RS: Yeah, I have an app that synced tracking numbers from shopify to PayPal. If you delivery times are ~10 days, then you will Get your money in 10 days. And as Alessio said, pay more attention to PayPal customers. Try to avoid cases
[12.12.23, 13:50:09] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I used VWO, I have same Shopify and PageFly. you create a duplicate page on PageFly, change the elements you want to test and send 50% traffic on both with VWO
[12.12.23, 14:14:35] ~ Kevin kreative: Depend on the PayPal account and if you have AM, you will have more endurable PayPal accounts. We have $300k monthly limit meaning that we can process up to $300k without holding
[12.12.23, 15:01:08] ~ Dr Tim: No, didn't install yet
[12.12.23, 15:06:38] ~ Mikael: Do anyone have contact to start hong kong company?
[12.12.23, 15:14:54] ~ L: https://osome.com/hk/company-registration/
[12.12.23, 15:15:29] ~ L: Has anyone opened a company in Hong Kong with osome?
[12.12.23, 19:32:44] ~ RS: Can somebody suggest me good shopify to PayPal tracking number syncing app? Currently using Trackipal but again it glitches and has not synced many orders since the end of November. And it is already the second time in 2 months that I need to contact their customer service, and they ask their devs to solve this.
[12.12.23, 19:43:23] ~ Peter: Synctrack is easily the best
[12.12.23, 19:44:20] ~ Robin: I’m using Paltrack, works fine for me
[12.12.23, 20:17:32] ~ Dr Tim: what are you using to track heatmaps on your funnels? I am looking for an affordable option please?
[12.12.23, 20:54:36] ~ Maxi: Guys is anyone using SMS Bump on their store, if yes how much revenue % does it bring extra ?

Including SMS flows and promotional sms
[12.12.23, 21:06:33] ~ Haroon: SMS has almost 90% open rate
[12.12.23, 21:06:43] ~ Haroon: it worked for me better then sms in the past
[12.12.23, 22:17:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is nobody getting into wise right now? I had no issues before opening a wise on a UK LLP but now i cant get in
[12.12.23, 22:17:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Waiting list
[12.12.23, 22:17:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Heard that before here
[13.12.23, 7:30:48] ~ Kamal: Hey guys, I switched over to stripe a couple weeks ago and today I got an email saying my account is being closed in 5 days. I'm requesting a further review but anyone had this happen to them before? Also if you have a contact at Stripe that can help me out would be much appreciated
[13.12.23, 11:14:29] ~ Allan L: VWO ? whats that short for?
[13.12.23, 11:42:13] ~ Alessandro Sassi: https://vwo.com/
[13.12.23, 11:54:44] ~ Santi Roa: I don't use PageFly (I use Gempages) but we tested most of the available options and the best by far was Convert
[13.12.23, 11:55:06] ~ Santi Roa: VWO used to be the greatest, but now seems buggy and not really up to date
[13.12.23, 11:55:28] ~ Chris Koh: VWO seems to be pricy too, any alternative options? @⁨~Santi Roa⁩
[13.12.23, 11:55:43] ~ Allan L: Convert as in a shopify app?
[13.12.23, 11:56:19] ~ Santi Roa: Not really, the cheap options are not very useful
[13.12.23, 11:56:26] ~ Santi Roa: Convert is expensive
[13.12.23, 11:56:33] ~ Santi Roa: But it is what it is🫠
[13.12.23, 11:56:55] ~ Santi Roa: https://www.convert.com/
[13.12.23, 11:57:45] ~ Santi Roa: I think we are paying 1.6k, but they have cheaper plans
[13.12.23, 11:58:18] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Doesn't GemPages have a built-in A/B test feature?
[13.12.23, 11:59:29] ~ Chris Koh: ‎POLL:
What would you test your landing pages & Sales Funnels?
‎OPTION: Product vs Product (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Offer vs Offer (2 votes)
‎OPTION: Price only (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Headlines (1 vote)
‎OPTION: CTAs (1 vote)
‎OPTION: Others (0 votes)
[13.12.23, 11:59:49] ~ Santi Roa: Yes, but the A/B testing feature measures only up to ATC (at least when we decided to go with convert) 

At some point, you'll also want to split test more complex funnels, the cart, theme settings, etc
[13.12.23, 12:00:18] ~ Chris Koh: I confirm this is something we are developing in house.
[13.12.23, 12:00:42] ~ Chris Koh: Right said @⁨~Santi Roa⁩ The team want to make it the next level soon.
[13.12.23, 12:02:18] ~ Santi Roa: It depends on your volume, though we are doing 1m+ /month consistently. Making it 1% better would add 10k in the month

So, from a 3% CR to 3.03% means an extra 10k in rev
[13.12.23, 12:04:34] ~ Santi Roa: So imagine if you experiment with a few things and go from 3% CR to 3.7% it's $230k more
[13.12.23, 12:04:54] ~ Santi Roa: That's great💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 I am happy to beta test it if you need
[13.12.23, 12:08:05] ~ Chris Koh: Sure my friend. 🥰👍🥰
[13.12.23, 12:09:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Any recommendations for paypal automatic tracking apps on shopify?

[13.12.23, 14:52:20] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I dmd you
[13.12.23, 15:01:29] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Anyone have good 3PL to recommend in US + in France?
[13.12.23, 15:27:07] ~ lengjoo: if you're low SKU, I can recc you ours
[13.12.23, 15:27:08] ~ lengjoo: ill dm you
[13.12.23, 15:27:43] ~ Ignasi: I’m interested as well please 🙏🏻
[13.12.23, 15:28:24] ~ lengjoo: got you
[13.12.23, 20:31:21] ~ Mike: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added Mike
[13.12.23, 21:12:41] ~ Maxi: Guys which flows do you have for SMS bump ?
[13.12.23, 21:14:07] ~ David B: Abandon cart reminder. Abandon browse reminder. Welcome flow reminder to use discount. Then campaigns for big promos eg Xmas sale.
[13.12.23, 21:14:21] ~ David B: Abandon cart is huge and will recover a lot of lost sales.
[13.12.23, 21:15:08] ~ Maxi: Thanks man!

How many SMS are enough for the abandon cart ? 3 ?
[13.12.23, 21:15:38] ~ David B: 1-2. You want to be very strategic with sms. Emails are impersonal. Texts are personal.
[13.12.23, 21:16:28] ~ David B: I'd go with 2. 

1. Did you forget something? 

2. Demand is high. We can only hold you item for 12 more hours. 

Something like that.
[13.12.23, 21:17:17] ~ David B: Open rates are high at around 90% for sms. But you need to keep a close eye on conversions.
[13.12.23, 21:17:30] ~ David B: Sms perform better than mms
[13.12.23, 21:17:37] ~ Maxi: You add discount codes to abandon cart flow ?
[13.12.23, 21:18:43] ~ David B: With some brands i work with for first time buyers we add an extra 10% off incentive. 

Here's a "bribe" to make your decision easier. Complete your order now and get an extra 10% off.
[13.12.23, 21:19:06] ~ David B: It depends on your margins and initial offer as to whether this would make sense for you.
[13.12.23, 21:21:45] ~ Maxi: Thank you, appreciate you quick help!

[14.12.23, 8:38:42] ~ seth: do you have the record?
[14.12.23, 14:34:44] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: For the people Selling in Norway, how do you adress the VOEC situation? Since you cant add a requirment field in the Shopify checkout for them to fill in the code.
My agent is telling me to just email every customer to get their VOEC code which is loads of work...
[14.12.23, 14:35:53] ~ Robin: Hmm really? My agent told me that they have fixed all this manually and that i don’t even have to concern about it
[14.12.23, 14:37:16] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Do you have the VOEC code?
[14.12.23, 14:38:17] ~ Robin: No?
[14.12.23, 14:43:22] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Just got info you need to apply here to get your own VOEC code https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/business-and-organisation/vat-and-duties/vat/foreign/e-commerce-voec/register/ 
If you dont have this code your customers will need to pay tax on the Product Before it can go through customs.
[14.12.23, 14:45:23] ~ Robin: Can't your agent work around it? In the same way as they have done in Sweden?
[14.12.23, 15:01:07] ~ Robin: Hey guys,

I am curious about this, what conversation rate do you aim for with your upsells?
[14.12.23, 15:31:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys, 

Right now when someone buys the upsell on funnelish, it creates 2 orders in shopify, is it possible that these orders come as one?
[14.12.23, 15:32:09] ~ RS: Yeah, Turn on Bundling in product automations
[14.12.23, 15:32:47] ~ RS: You need to enable bundling for every product, also your products in upsell pages
[14.12.23, 15:34:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Allright! Thanks, what should be the time?
[14.12.23, 15:34:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 10 minutes or so?
[14.12.23, 15:44:47] Topi: We used 15 and usually it came in 1 order
[14.12.23, 15:46:13] ~ RS: What apps do you use for chargeback alerts (RDR)? Do you use Chargeblast?
[14.12.23, 16:59:45] ~ Denys: https://www.chargeflow.io/
[14.12.23, 17:00:16] ~ RS: They Also send RDR alerts?
[14.12.23, 17:00:28] ~ Denys: There is also a midigator, but they have complicated installation process
[14.12.23, 17:00:46] ~ RS: With chargeblast, it seems that to set up VISA alerts, it takes 3 weeks.
[14.12.23, 17:01:02] ~ RS: Oh. Right now I am registering for it.
[14.12.23, 17:01:08] ~ Denys: they have everything, and it's one click installation
[14.12.23, 17:01:49] ~ RS: Thank you, I will check this as well. You just enable it and both VISA and MC alerts will be set up quickly? Or it Also needs a few weeks
[14.12.23, 17:02:06] ~ Denys: just install the app
[14.12.23, 17:02:16] ~ RS: Ok Thanks man
[14.12.23, 17:03:00] ~ Denys: I think it's a couple of days, not weeks for alert service installation with them
[14.12.23, 17:03:18] ~ Denys: you can book a call with them
[14.12.23, 17:03:35] ~ RS: Okay. Will check them out. Thank you
[14.12.23, 17:43:05] Alex  Fedotoff: Team, my ESS call today at 1:30pm est is cancelled. Hit me up directly if you have specific questions/ challenges to address
[14.12.23, 20:25:06] ~ Kyle Alexander: Hey guys my co-packer in the UK has dropped the ball big time. 
Does anyone have a recommendation for co-packer/manufacturer for powders/coffee blends?
[14.12.23, 22:06:04] ~ Farhat Godil: Anyone has information for a TikTok rep to get my TikTok shop approved. I got suspended because unknowingly used same LLC information on all 4 shops
[14.12.23, 22:25:33] ~ Natasha Iris: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩
[14.12.23, 22:32:01] ~ Mike Ramsey: Already sent
[15.12.23, 11:18:42] ~ Jeremy Leppink: When testing a new offer, how long do you give it time on a €300 budget daily? 

I had a offer working very good but people mostly choose the biggest bundle of 4 pieces, so i wanted to test a offer with 6 pieces as well (4 pieces is still available). 

right when i changed the offer my conversion rate dropped a lot 
(i changed it yesterday early in the evening) and today absolutely nothing is happening. 

Should i still give it some more time?
[15.12.23, 11:25:32] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I advise you to test different offers with new LP and adset

Facebook can find you different buyers depending on the offer.
[15.12.23, 11:30:59] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Even on a "small" change like this? 

I had a 2 / 3 / 4 piece bundle before which worked great, now testing 2 / 4 / 6 and it does nothing
[15.12.23, 12:05:34] ~ Robin: Does anyone know if it’s legal to take an email list you currently have to a new brand? Because you own the email list right?
[15.12.23, 12:06:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i know a formal agency i used to work with said its possible but you have to apply something in your legal pages to do this
[15.12.23, 12:06:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i believe it was something like that your new brand is part of your old brand or something
[15.12.23, 14:46:45] ~ Lachy Waldon: Has anyone ever had their store just disappear?
[15.12.23, 14:49:31] ~ Lachy Waldon: I’ve got a store we do around 300k/ month and it’s literally just disappeared
[15.12.23, 14:52:25] ~ lengjoo: shopify took it down? ‎<This message was edited>
[15.12.23, 14:55:38] ~ Lachy Waldon: is it down?
[15.12.23, 15:02:49] ~ Rajat Grover: no...it shows no errors
[15.12.23, 14:57:59] ~ Rajat Grover: https://www.shopifystatus.com/
[15.12.23, 14:58:26] ~ lengjoo: sorry was asking a question 😂 most likely shopify took it down if your website is hosted there
[15.12.23, 14:58:41] ~ Lachy Waldon: why would they do that?
[15.12.23, 14:58:48] ~ Lachy Waldon: We’ve been running for a 18 months
[15.12.23, 14:58:52] ~ Luka: Check your email, any email?
[15.12.23, 14:58:56] ~ Lachy Waldon: maybe had 3 chargebacks in history
[15.12.23, 14:58:58] ~ Lachy Waldon: Nothing in emails
[15.12.23, 14:58:59] ~ Luka: Did you steal content, do illegal/high-risk stuff etc?
[15.12.23, 14:59:04] ~ Luka: What shows up when you visit your site
[15.12.23, 14:59:06] ~ Lachy Waldon: Nope
[15.12.23, 14:59:29] ~ Luka: What shows up when you visit admin too
‎[15.12.23, 14:59:48] ~ Lachy Waldon: ‎image omitted
[15.12.23, 15:00:05] ~ Luka: It says, contact support
[15.12.23, 15:00:10] ~ Luka: Somebody might have filed a DMCA
[15.12.23, 15:00:31] ~ Lachy Waldon: Yeah i’ve contacted
[15.12.23, 15:00:33] ~ Lachy Waldon: just waiting
[15.12.23, 15:01:31] ~ Rajat Grover: on this website
[15.12.23, 15:24:01] ~ Tim Alleraun: I want to set up an email flow where people can rate their experience with us + only 5 start ratings will be led to TrustPilot (maybe they will even get a discount code). Do you have any experience with this? Any apps or softwares maybe?
[15.12.23, 15:31:56] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Unlicensed theme?
[15.12.23, 15:44:26] ~ Lachy Waldon: Nah it was licensed theme
[15.12.23, 15:44:48] ~ Lachy Waldon: why would shopify nuke my store? We’ve done over 50k orders and only ever had 5 chargebacks
[15.12.23, 15:57:47] ~ Marko: You set up an an email with some emojis. Sad ones and happy ones. Sad ones have a link to an evaluation form, happy ones go to truspilot
[15.12.23, 15:58:43] ~ Tim Alleraun: Very smart, so pretty much like a button, right?
[15.12.23, 15:59:12] ~ Marko: So just say something like rate your experience:

😔🙁😄😍
[15.12.23, 15:59:20] ~ Marko: And then each one is a link
[15.12.23, 16:39:35] ~ Tim Alleraun: Awesome, thanks for the tip!
[15.12.23, 19:59:58] ~ Kyle Twohill: this is the mistake I made I realize on my  best performing funnel a few months back. I had no idea this was a think with facebook. I was selling an item in 3 colors and you would basically sleect which one. I then made the  checkout page show bundles of 1-2-3-and 4 items. It never performed nearly the same
[15.12.23, 20:00:41] ~ Kyle Twohill: so different URL on funnelish etc, I did this with a split test before on the same funnel maybe that was a mistake.
[15.12.23, 20:06:34] ~ Mikael: Anyone of you who have used Juni bank Before? they seem to be a bank for Ecommerce. anyone with experience with them?
[15.12.23, 21:14:49] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Bit weird though right, should just go back to normal if you switch back
[15.12.23, 22:06:52] ~ Kyle Twohill: yeah you would think adding bundles to increase aov would have no negative impact lol
[15.12.23, 22:18:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I mean 2/3/4 was working great, i was doing a steady roas 5 over multiple days. The only thing i did was remove 3 and add 6 and today i am on a whopping roas 0,6 lol
[15.12.23, 22:19:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Could just be a bad day because daily budget is 320 so im not too worried or anything. Ads data looks fine except for roas and CTR on salespage is also very good. Just the CTR on checkout is only 1,3%
[15.12.23, 23:03:12] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team! Some awesome swipe file of direct response ads and VSL's: https://app.gethookd.ai/share/board/417?signature=1e4a406de88be9d6c8747e6ab2924f66cc30467f6c6f0a3da8a31a1d5b7a75e2
[15.12.23, 23:17:34] ~ Gordon: Hello everyone - does anyone have any good Facebook ad agency account recommendations? For semi-greyhat weight loss products
[16.12.23, 5:31:55] ~ Lachy Waldon: My store is still down and virtually doesn’t exist. Anyone know how long something like this takes for shopify to get back? We’ve got orders to fulfil in time for christmas and this is 100% affecting our brands reputation
[16.12.23, 8:36:20] ~ ARTURS: I’ve been using it for past 6 months +-. No problems so far.
[16.12.23, 8:38:22] ~ ARTURS: We do this too - also, you can go with 5 stars (all inserted as separate images) and connect 1-3 stars with evaluation form (Docs or Typeform) and 4-5 stars to Trustpilot
[16.12.23, 8:43:48] ~ Lareina: Hit me up as well if anyone has good recommendations thanks!
[16.12.23, 11:34:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is it normal that when cpm is lowering significantly, the CTR is lowering too?
[16.12.23, 11:36:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I started in €25 cpm with a CTR of close to 6%, now, 5 days further my CPM dropped all the way down to about €8,50, but CTR also dropped to 2,4%
[16.12.23, 11:38:18] Topi: Yes i notice this very often @⁨~Jeremy Leppink⁩
[16.12.23, 11:39:17] ~ L: @⁨~Jeremy Leppink⁩ Same for me, no problem
[16.12.23, 11:39:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ok 🙌
[16.12.23, 12:05:50] ~ Mikael: Perfect 👍 what about converting curriencies in their bank? Takes 1-2 days?
[16.12.23, 12:13:59] ~ Maxi: Guys do you use the pages "comment moderation" option? 

Where you upload a bunch of comments to be filtered out etc.
[16.12.23, 12:18:12] ~ David: this is normal
[16.12.23, 15:40:14] ~ Malik: Is it possible to do Free shipping after a certain amount on funnelish ?
[16.12.23, 15:46:18] ~ Malik: Or for example if they take bundle of 2+, shipping is free ?
[16.12.23, 15:46:44] ~ Memed: You have to calculate it in the price
[16.12.23, 15:48:45] ~ Malik: I see thanks brother
[16.12.23, 15:54:27] Topi: Anyone using geo funnels in funnelish and have succesful klaviyo abandoned checkout flow? Would have few questions
[16.12.23, 15:57:54] ~ Maxi: I have
[16.12.23, 15:58:33] Topi: Thank you bro will pm
[16.12.23, 23:36:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For the people selling in Germany, is giropay, EPS, sofort important? Right now im using creditcard PayPal and Klarna.
[16.12.23, 23:58:15] D-r Simeon Madzharov: Is it possible to use Hot Jar in Funnelish ?
[17.12.23, 2:17:26] ~ Kyle Twohill: does anyone have a really good shopify dev? Im looking to make some pretty complex updates to my page looking for a good referral
[17.12.23, 2:20:03] ~ Adonis A: Might have a guy for you bro
[17.12.23, 2:25:02] ~ Dr Tim: do you guys engage customers on Whatsapp at all?
[17.12.23, 2:25:29] ~ Dr Tim: in addition, do you engage abandoned checkout customers on whatsapp too?
[17.12.23, 4:21:30] ~ Dr Tim: if you're using funnelish, how are you filfulling orders? is it through shopify connected to CJ? do you need to pay shopify card processing fees for your order again after the CJ fees or you're processing the order from inside CJ? Please advise?

I have running ads to Funnelish. Customer pays through Funnelish. I have CJdropshipping connected to Shopfiy and will like to now fulfil the customer's order. 

Thank you.
[17.12.23, 4:38:40] ~ Dr Tim: Question, how do I fulfil an order generated through funnelish? I have CJdropshipping to connected to Shopfiy but the setup doesn’t make sense, am i paying shopify another card processing fees to process the order? or should i process directly on CJ? 

This is the simplified question now.
[17.12.23, 4:42:18] ~ Y: You do not pay any commissions or processing fees for orders synced from funnelish to shopify, the fulfillment process for those orders will just be like typical shopify orders
[17.12.23, 4:42:40] ~ Dr Tim: Can I DM please?
[17.12.23, 4:43:05] ~ Y: sure
[17.12.23, 4:46:52] ~ Dr Tim: DM sent
[17.12.23, 6:43:34] ~ Lachy Waldon: Does anyone have any inside contacts at shopify I can use to try and get my store back. Now down for almost 48 hours. This is a store that consistently generates 10k+ / day for the last 12 months. 

My store has been taken down without any notice whatsoever 

Any help would be appreciated
[17.12.23, 10:10:36] ~ Luka: Is there anything we can do to make a price increase work? We increased our pricing for ex. from $54.95 to $59.95 and saw a massive drop in CR/ROAS, profitability dropped. Another brand selling a similar product is charging $77 successful at scale. 

They have a super short sales page, doesn't solve a direct problem (more of a comfort product, while our solves a direct pain point) and ads are lower quality but they seem to be able to charge $77
[17.12.23, 10:11:20] ~ Luka: This is our first time increasing our price and are seeing massive resistance, we were gonna do 3 increases to ~ $69.95 for example. But at the first attempt, we're seeing strong resistance
[17.12.23, 10:16:02] ~ Ignasi: I’ve gone thru this. It takes time for Facebook to find you users willing to pay more. This is what we’ve learned 

1) don’t change quantities or prices on the landing page — it will reset optimization
2) instead,  start a brand new test and give it time.
[17.12.23, 10:17:35] ~ Luka: Interesting, even for such a small price increase?

We changed it on our whole pricing overall, since we sell on 2 other platforms (like amazon) which a lot of people land on our LP, and buy there so we didn't do any split-test but rather just increased the pricing overall
[17.12.23, 10:17:42] ~ Luka: How long did it take for FB to adjust the audience?
[17.12.23, 10:18:07] ~ Ignasi: The main reason for the immediate drop in performance, in our case, is that Facebook will retarget users that have seen the lower price
[17.12.23, 10:18:30] ~ Ignasi: A few days. In some cases we needed to relaunch the old offer
[17.12.23, 10:19:10] ~ Ignasi: In our case it’s took us about 6 weeks to update all offers form an AOV of 45 to 65
[17.12.23, 10:19:32] ~ Ignasi: No problem on Amazon either. Just meta
[17.12.23, 10:19:47] ~ Luka: It's the weekend to atm, will let it run for several more days and see what happens. We'll add a free gift too to increase the value of the offer
[17.12.23, 10:20:02] ~ Ignasi: 👍
[17.12.23, 10:20:02] ~ Luka: 6 weeks - during that time you experienced less profitability than prior or?
[17.12.23, 10:20:20] ~ Ignasi: Yes. We had to work really hard on the conversion rate of the landing page
[17.12.23, 10:20:54] ~ Luka: Interesting, thank you. Gives me more confidence we can make the price increase work
[17.12.23, 10:21:24] ~ Ignasi: Yes. It just takes time and a “new audience”
[17.12.23, 10:21:59] ~ Ignasi: We’re in the process of going from 65 to 85 so I feel your pain
[17.12.23, 10:22:59] ~ Luka: In that case, would you be better off just increasing the pricing from $65 to $85 right away.... VS $65 -> $75 -> $85? 
You'd avoid FB having to find the audience twice
[17.12.23, 10:25:24] ~ Ignasi: Yes. That’s what we’re doing. It’s a drama worth living 😂
[17.12.23, 10:31:17] ~ Luka: Good luck to ya, fingers crossed it's short & as painless as possible ha
[17.12.23, 11:52:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I did the exact same thing last week, it was a mistake. My roas went from a average roas 5 to 0.6 next day
[17.12.23, 11:52:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Everything is fine just checkout % dropped hard
[17.12.23, 11:53:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Its a bit better now but not what it was yet so im not touching it anymore 😂
[17.12.23, 11:54:18] ~ RS: I increase my bundling price from 119.95 to 129.95, 134.95 to 164.95, 179.95 to 199.95 and my CR and AOV went up. At 60 orders per day with the same volume, my profit increased by over Extra 600$ a day. But depends on the product and offer
[17.12.23, 11:55:14] ~ RS: One product cost still was the same. Changed only for Bundles starting from bundle of 2 to bundle of 4
[17.12.23, 11:55:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I did this and it got wrecked, went from 2/3/4 pieces to 2/4/6
[17.12.23, 11:56:17] ~ RS: I have 1/2/3/4/5 Bundle variants. Work great. I added Extra bundle of 5 for 219.95 and it Also works good
[17.12.23, 11:56:26] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Nice
[17.12.23, 12:20:49] ~ Malik: Hey guys quick question. I'm launching a new store + Funnelish and I want to use the same Stripe subaccount I used this year with thousands of orders and almost no chargebacks. If I connect it to my new funnelish account it won't trigger anything right ? I don't want to lose it.
[17.12.23, 12:20:57] ~ Malik: How did you do guys with several stores ?
[17.12.23, 12:20:59] ~ Malik: same Stripe ?
[17.12.23, 12:21:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I use the same
[17.12.23, 12:21:21] ~ Malik: Perfect
[17.12.23, 12:21:23] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Same stripe
[17.12.23, 12:21:31] ~ Malik: Love it! Thanks guys
[17.12.23, 13:11:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: is there a easy way to see Post-ID on fb/
[17.12.23, 17:21:17] ~ Anvar: What’s the best co to open LLC for non US residents?
‎[17.12.23, 17:59:41] ~ Lareina: ‎image omitted
[17.12.23, 18:23:09] ~ Kamal: I just refund them and send them an email apologizing
[17.12.23, 18:24:01] ~ L: Guys any of you is still experiencing problems with checkout in France ? (Shopify payments and stripe)
[17.12.23, 19:23:47] ~ Santi Roa: You can refund a small amount like 0.23 and ask them to confirm how much they got refunded. If they confirm that you continue fulfillment
[17.12.23, 19:56:41] ~ G M: By going from avo of 45 to 65, do you also raise the margin on the product? That is, if, for example, at 45 you had a Cogs + Shipping of 4.5 ( thus a multiplier x 10) by going to 65 you also raise the multiplier ( from 10 becomes example 11)?
[17.12.23, 20:32:58] ~ Dr Tim: When you ship from China through CJ, do you send customers the tracking number?
[17.12.23, 21:34:15] ~ Ignasi: Same cost. Just a price bump
[17.12.23, 21:49:35] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: What credit cards would you guys say is the best to have for points and benefits? For traveling etc? Looking to get one in 2024, Amex Platinum?
[17.12.23, 22:02:42] ~ Kyle Twohill: Amex gold by far
[17.12.23, 22:03:13] ~ Kyle Twohill: For getting lots of points then plaitnum for travel
[17.12.23, 22:07:45] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Will mostly be using it for travel
[17.12.23, 22:10:19] ~ Kyle Twohill: The gold gives you like 4x points on ad spend up to 150k yearly spend, but you can stack like multiple of the cards to gain lots of points. Then the plaitnum gives you lots of travel benefits etc so stacking both is good.
[17.12.23, 22:11:38] ~ G M: As a non US resident with LLC, can I get accepted?
[17.12.23, 22:26:07] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: What is the best tracking app for customers?
[17.12.23, 22:51:00] ~ Santi Roa: Are you currently an Amex user in your home country?
[18.12.23, 5:47:20] ~ Luka: What's the best UGC sourcing platform that has many Aussie creators? Considering Influee atm
[18.12.23, 7:46:30] ~ G M: Nope
[18.12.23, 14:09:46] ~ Aashi: Hi, we are getting a LOT of scammers commenting on our ads with different pages and links everytime.

Tried blocking comments with links, but it doesn't work as they are using different formats every time. 

How do you guys control such comments? Talked to FB support and they said nothing can be done. 

We are blocking manually for now, but it is chaos to be honest.

Would highly appreciate your suggestions.
[18.12.23, 14:16:49] ~ Luka: Check what keywords they use often, and block those keywords from your FB settings
[18.12.23, 14:18:11] ~ Aashi: They actually dont use any specific keywords. They use random words like rs, dc and then a link that is not their actual website link but a redirect link.
[18.12.23, 14:45:48] ~ Santi Roa: Same happened to us
[18.12.23, 14:45:59] ~ Santi Roa: I don't know if my team solved it but it's really annoying
[18.12.23, 14:48:12] ~ Aashi: Oh yes it is. People buy from these links too because they price them very low and never ship. Affecting our sales and customer experience. 

FB rep suggested to try napoleon cat. Looking into it but not sure it would get the job done.
[18.12.23, 14:49:46] ~ Aashi: Let me know if you figure this out . Our VAs are already loaded with tickets atm. Trying to reduce their load as well.
[18.12.23, 16:09:42] ~ lengjoo: anyone used hyros for funnelish, how was your experience?

[18.12.23, 18:59:12] ~ busy: ‎‎~ busy changed their phone number to a new number. ‎Tap to message new number.
[18.12.23, 19:04:34] ~ Bryan T: What’s a normal range to pay a month for customer service? Trying to see if I’m overpaying rn
[18.12.23, 19:05:27] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Im paying about $1300, I Think its a bit expensive but I got loads of emails so Worth it.

[18.12.23, 19:46:08] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Is there anyone in our group in bedding industry?
[18.12.23, 20:15:01] ~ lengjoo: yo guys, if you have a new product, new demographic, but in the same brand, how would you advertise it on tiktok?

same ad account, different pixels?
or a different ad account, new pixel?
or just same ad account, same pixel?
[18.12.23, 20:15:47] ~ Bryan T: Yeah thanks for the answers on customer service, based off this I'm clearly overpaying and will find a new solution
[18.12.23, 21:55:39] Alex  Fedotoff: Team, if you are looking for a solid 3pl in USA with transparent pricing structure I highly recommend this company: https://www.shipdudes.com/book-a-call
[18.12.23, 21:56:09] Alex  Fedotoff: No hidden costs and Ecom entrepreneurs running it so they know the challenges of our business 😂
[19.12.23, 0:12:26] ~ Farhat Godil: Does rejected ads only affect that particular page that they were published on or also the domains get affected due to old rejected ads?
[19.12.23, 12:22:51] ~ Robin: I’m having some trouble with stripe, anyone here has a contact?
[19.12.23, 13:12:57] ~ David B: *COPY CALL TODAY AT 10EST - WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CONVERSION RATE OPTIMIZATION* 

CRO is all about converting more of your customers. 

The average conversion rate is just over 2% meaning 2 out of very 100 customers make a purchase...

No imagine you could get that number up to 4%...

Just a 2% increase in conversion could double your revenue WITHOUT you having to dump anymore money into ads. 

Today I'm going to cover what it is, how it works, and how you can do it. 

These insights come from my time working with BGS who are responsible for over $400M in ecom sales. 

I hope to see as many of you there as possible!
[19.12.23, 13:58:03] ~ Zain Ahmed: we got our account closed and recovered it in the last week. what happened?
[19.12.23, 14:02:55] ~ Robin: PM’ed you

[19.12.23, 14:18:55] ~ L: Guys any of you is still experiencing problems with checkout in France ? (Shopify payments and stripe)
[19.12.23, 14:26:38] ~ Kamal: Hey guys I had to turn my fb ads off for a week due to payment processing issues.

Now I want to turn them back on, do I keep the same spend they had before or should i drop the budgets and scale up again? I tried turning them on yesterday at same spend and they performed pretty badly
[19.12.23, 14:28:17] ~ Rajat Grover: for me, it takes 4-5 days again to account to be normal
[19.12.23, 14:28:48] ~ Rajat Grover: but usually I duplicate adsets with some better offer  if it’s not performing well
[19.12.23, 14:34:30] ~ Rajat Grover: ‎Alex  Fedotoff removed ~ Rajat Grover
[19.12.23, 14:35:13] ~ Kamal: Alright thanks man will wait it out a couple more days and see

See you there.
[19.12.23, 16:59:12] Matán Intsuper: How did u guys recover it ?
[19.12.23, 17:00:26] Matán Intsuper: I see that many people have stripe issues recently. Can we get a stripe insider somehow?
[19.12.23, 17:00:46] ~ RS: I wrote them emails explaining my business model etc. Also I added all the docs related to the business, photos of inventory, invocies and proof of fulfillment for past 2 weeks, agreement with supplier, bank statement for the last 6 months etc
[19.12.23, 17:01:03] Matán Intsuper: They just sent me this review form last night
[19.12.23, 17:01:12] Matán Intsuper: Due to scaling
[19.12.23, 17:01:33] ~ RS: Yes, after that you can reply to their email with all the relevant info and docs
[19.12.23, 17:01:35] Matán Intsuper: They’re only asking for 5 tracking numbers and explanation of my business model. should I say it’s dropshipping? What do you suggest
[19.12.23, 17:01:53] Matán Intsuper: If I provide the tracking they would see it’s from china.
[19.12.23, 17:01:59] ~ RS: I never tell that Im dropshipping 😀 Of course, they understand this
[19.12.23, 17:02:10] ~ RS: Did they disabled your stripe acc?
[19.12.23, 17:02:20] Matán Intsuper: I have 4. One was disabled in July
[19.12.23, 17:02:27] Matán Intsuper: The rest are good without reserve
[19.12.23, 17:02:35] Matán Intsuper: My biggest one received the form last night
[19.12.23, 17:02:54] ~ RS: But they have not placed any reserves or paused payouts now?
[19.12.23, 17:02:59] Matán Intsuper: They are holding $18k on that one and said they would refund the customers
[19.12.23, 17:03:04] Matán Intsuper: They paused payouts in the new one ‎<This message was edited>
[19.12.23, 17:03:14] ~ RS: Oh okay
[19.12.23, 17:03:42] ~ RS: Yep that happened to me as well but I got mine acc reenabled and received my 30k today
[19.12.23, 17:03:59] Matán Intsuper: How did u do that? They won’t answer my emails
[19.12.23, 17:04:28] ~ RS: I got the account closure email from them, and then I just replied to the email
[19.12.23, 17:04:41] ~ Robin: Same here, they are terrible at answering emails
[19.12.23, 17:04:56] ~ RS: I think they have very many cases now
[19.12.23, 17:05:00] Matán Intsuper: They replied several times and always said the same thing, we reviewed again and it will stay closed. After 3-4 like that, tú eu stopped answering
[19.12.23, 17:05:08] Matán Intsuper: But I’m more worried about the new account
[19.12.23, 17:05:22] Matán Intsuper: I mean they have no reason to shut it down
[19.12.23, 17:05:26] Matán Intsuper: The dispute rate is good
[19.12.23, 17:05:41] Matán Intsuper: 0.6%
[19.12.23, 17:05:48] Matán Intsuper: But probably a reserve
[19.12.23, 17:13:33] ~ Zain Ahmed: same. they said that their decision was final but they reversed it
[19.12.23, 17:14:47] ~ RS: They can out reserve or even close your acc if you scale too hard from what I have heard. Because it triggers their AI
[19.12.23, 17:33:35] ~ Zain Ahmed: Yeah we went from 0$ on stripe to like 90k processed in like 3 weeks that was enough for them to shut us down
[19.12.23, 17:35:39] Matán Intsuper: I was pretty stable for 4-5 months but now I doubled my rev suddenly
[19.12.23, 17:35:45] Matán Intsuper: One of the scaling campaigns suddenly worked
[19.12.23, 17:35:54] Matán Intsuper: And that triggered the review
[19.12.23, 18:16:34] ~ David B: Hey guys and gals. Thank you for those that attended the copy call today.

[19.12.23, 23:11:24] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team! Does anyone have access/ contact to Amazon insider
[20.12.23, 3:32:11] ~ Kyle Twohill: Quicik question, what are your subscription take rates and how long do customers typically stay subbed? Curious trying to come up with one for one of my brands
[20.12.23, 4:56:28] ~ Lachy Waldon: Does anyone have a shopify contact
[20.12.23, 4:56:33] ~ Lachy Waldon: I need one urgently
[20.12.23, 11:23:59] ~ Mikael: How are you guys experiencing the sales during this week? 
For us its gone down by alot during this week
[20.12.23, 11:31:04] Marek Olszewski: it's expected right before christmas, most people spent their money on gifts, you can boost your revenue with email campaigns while people are still in their buying mood
[20.12.23, 11:31:49] ~ Alessandro Sassi: yeah, big drop since yesterday
[20.12.23, 11:32:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: My performance is a bit down since this week, mostly because ads get more expensive. Cpm is fairly the same, cpc is rising and CTR is dropping
[20.12.23, 11:32:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Furthermore its still fine
[20.12.23, 11:32:41] ~ seth: for me it's drop since this month
[20.12.23, 12:11:39] ~ Luka: Anyone have any experience if adding more payment method hurts your checkout conversion rate? We have 3 atm and are about to add 1 more (installments) but are considering adding 2 more that are not so popular, but still used by 5-10% people
[20.12.23, 13:06:09] ~ Robin: Anyone can recommend a payment processor for funnelish? I feel like stripe is a bit risky
[20.12.23, 15:06:45] ~ Luka: *Insense VS Influee* - which would be better to get UGC Video assets?
[20.12.23, 15:24:05] ~ Denys: I think Influee is better if you want to hire creators from EU
[20.12.23, 15:29:42] ~ Tim Alleraun: Anyone who succesfully registered his/her foreign company for sales tax in the US?
[20.12.23, 15:30:43] ~ Santi Roa: I did
[20.12.23, 15:31:14] ~ Santi Roa: Then I switched to a US llc
[20.12.23, 15:31:18] ~ Tim Alleraun: I'll shoot you a quick message if you don't mind
[20.12.23, 15:31:25] ~ Santi Roa: But I have a freelancer that might be of help
[20.12.23, 15:31:27] ~ Santi Roa: Sure
[20.12.23, 19:46:57] ~ Mohammed-amine: Can anyone recommend a high level tax lawyer who specialise in tax efficient company structures?
[20.12.23, 20:12:10] ~ Mohammed-amine: in the US
[20.12.23, 22:03:23] ~ Harout: ‎Lucia Van added ~ Harout
[21.12.23, 6:09:44] ~ Lachy Waldon: Can I get some help? My store is still down and haven’t heard a thing from shopify. Going to put up a twitter post and tag shopify and would love some people to comment. 

https://x.com/lachlanwaldon/status/1737686606356902151?s=46&t=xn09vPjqd2n2KtIj2dP8aw
[21.12.23, 6:15:52] ~ Matt: Make sure the post is not private
[21.12.23, 6:16:43] ~ Lachy Waldon: how do i do that 😅
‎[21.12.23, 6:26:42] ~ Luka: ‎image omitted
[21.12.23, 6:26:49] ~ Luka: Probably somewhere in your settings
[21.12.23, 6:27:22] ~ Lachy Waldon: should be fixed now!
[21.12.23, 13:45:31] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: Does anyone know if using a new page on a new domain, will help with any circumventing issues.

Previous page had a below 2 feedback score, want to use a new one. Scared of getting banned, so would using a new domain with the new page get around this?
[21.12.23, 13:46:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You can, how i did it before was when i am making a page i leave all the info out and make sure to do the 13 steps
[21.12.23, 13:46:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But dont add a domain name or email or anything
[21.12.23, 13:46:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So they cant link it, and dont call the name of your page as your domain
[21.12.23, 13:47:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: This worked pretty good, not sure now though as i have high scores for a long time
[21.12.23, 17:09:39] ~ LA: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ LA
[21.12.23, 17:14:26] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team! Heard from multiple of you guys about issues with stripe, PayPal, Shopify payments. Holds, reserves, closed payment processors can impact your ability to scale and just lots of headaches.

[21.12.23, 19:13:10] Matán Intsuper: same in dashboard
[21.12.23, 19:18:36] Yaniv: It is legit
[21.12.23, 21:21:25] ~ Alessandro: Huge drop on my 3 shops today. When do you think guys the sales will start to be normally? After 26?
[21.12.23, 21:22:11] ~ Robert Gonzalez: yeah, , mine have dropped a lot too

See you there! 🫵🏼
[21.12.23, 23:50:24] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: Are you pausing ads, or letting them run?
[21.12.23, 23:53:19] ~ RS: I still run. 10% profit margin but still profit
[22.12.23, 0:49:54] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: Would you guys recommend starting testing ads? I've been out of advertising for about 3months due to processing issues. Should I relaunch now, or new years?
[22.12.23, 1:16:42] ~ Haroon: Guys did any of your Facebook profiles get hacked and spent thousands of dollars + posting child porn content on your profile? This happened to me and since a while my profile is gone, can’t login, none. I tried getting it through attorneys in they contacted Facebook but no answer. Any experienced this and some tips?
[22.12.23, 1:55:11] ~ L: An insider will be the only solution I think
[22.12.23, 2:07:14] ~ Matt: I got hacked through a chrome extension at the beginning of November and have tried working with an insider but still do not have access back to anything. How do you know that that’s the type of content that they posted to your profile? Because I wonder if that’s what I’m dealing with sense the final step in retrieving my profile is getting a approval past community guidelines violations
[22.12.23, 2:18:27] ~ Haroon: yeah the tiktok sort I heard from paul
[22.12.23, 2:18:35] ~ Haroon: I never used it actually
[22.12.23, 2:19:01] ~ Haroon: Bro I logged in and saw a pic saying this was the violation reason
[22.12.23, 2:19:29] ~ Haroon: they used that so I couldn’t login into it anymore and I’ve spend almost 100k with that profile
[22.12.23, 2:19:41] ~ Haroon: reason was child porn content
[22.12.23, 2:20:39] ~ Haroon: These hackers are crazy, I think I need to learn coding and programming lmao these possibilities with hacking are crazy, you’re never safe.
[22.12.23, 2:21:28] ~ Haroon: Where find ?
[22.12.23, 9:44:44] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys for NZ, AU, CA in Funnelish

How which currency display converts best

CAD vs $
NZD vs $
AUD vs $ ?
[22.12.23, 9:56:28] ~ Maxi: localised for me.

AUD in Australia, 

CAD in Canada and so on
[22.12.23, 9:56:43] ~ Maxi: I never tried New Zealand, is it good ?
[22.12.23, 10:05:55] ~ Luka: So for Australia, you'd mention it with "AUD" = $30 AUD ?
[22.12.23, 10:06:23] ~ Maxi: correct
[22.12.23, 10:06:30] ~ Luka: Cool thanks good to know
[22.12.23, 10:06:51] ~ Maxi: they are being charged USD in the backend though... until my AUD MIDs arrive
[22.12.23, 10:24:19] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Okay interessing thanks
[22.12.23, 10:26:02] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: But already tested vs $ in checkout?

Because if we have by exemple Australian flag
People know that is in AUD no?
[22.12.23, 10:26:55] ~ Maxi: Im not sure but I think if you to any Australian store it will be displayed in AUD
[22.12.23, 10:27:08] ~ Maxi: I mean with the AUF after the amount
[22.12.23, 10:27:12] ~ Maxi: AUD*
[22.12.23, 10:30:17] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Okay thank you we will test
[22.12.23, 10:42:43] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I have $ on my Shopify page displayed instead of USD, CAD, NZD etc, but despite the presence of the flag people still get confused
[22.12.23, 10:49:02] ~ Maxi: Because people expect their currency and no their flag usually…

They rather see AUD than the Australian flag.

Depending on your audience, 40-50+ will definetly get confused if they see the flag and not AUD.

They might think the product comes from the US because why would there be an Australian flag on a native Australian store ?!, and it will take a few weeks to Australia etc. and don’t want to order at all.
[22.12.23, 10:50:56] ~ Dr Tim: Guys if you're using Cjdropshipping, how did you setup your 'track my shipping' page on funnelish so customers can track their orders please?
[22.12.23, 11:09:17] ~ Mikael: Anyone doing high ticket dropshipping? For example selling saunas from local company?
[22.12.23, 11:11:02] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Yes you have right
[22.12.23, 12:15:16] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Guys, On our paypal we charge $30 every time someone opens a won or lost dispute.

Has anyone ever faced the same situation?

This represents more than 20k over the last 3 months just in litigation won by ourselves.

Does anyone have a solution?
[22.12.23, 12:22:07] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 30$, that means you have a high risk account right?
[22.12.23, 12:22:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: dispute rate of 1.5%+
[22.12.23, 12:23:39] ~ RS: High risk dispute fee. It happened to me a while ago. But every month my dispute rate dropped so now I have a  standard dispute fee and under 1% chargeback rate
[22.12.23, 12:24:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: then its not that much anymore right, like half
[22.12.23, 12:24:48] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i had the same thing
[22.12.23, 12:54:31] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: What I can do?
[22.12.23, 13:03:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Getting it lower basically
[22.12.23, 13:03:26] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Somehow the product or service does not meet the customer expectations
[22.12.23, 13:04:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Could be transparency about shipping, could be customer service that does not think outside of the box and follows simple SOPs, could be quality
[22.12.23, 14:32:20] ~ Kyle Alexander: hey does anyone know if there is an ESS coach who could help us with SEO?
[22.12.23, 15:35:30] ~ Tarlan: @⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩
I tested $ vs displaying currency code on Funnelish.   

Displaying currency code worked better, since it reduces confusion and potential customer loss.

However since adding currency code next to all numbers looks ugly, I added Noticable NOTE that all prices displayed in x currency in checkout page, and it increased CR even more than just displaying currency codes.
[22.12.23, 15:36:17] ~ Maxi: Where did you add this ?
[22.12.23, 15:37:16] ~ Tarlan: Right below where I display product bundles. If to be specific, in between products and order bumps
[22.12.23, 15:43:34] ~ Tarlan: While answering customer tickets, your customer support, can check whoever paid with Paypal and be extra careful with them. 

We offer more partial refunds for Paypal customers compare to others. It helped us a lot and reduced our Paypal disputes rate.
[22.12.23, 16:17:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For the people opening a new company in a different country, did you also open a new paypal?
[22.12.23, 16:18:11] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Or is it possible to change my current paypal info to a new business?
[22.12.23, 16:22:00] Matán Intsuper: Does anyone have a tip/proven method/contact for winning chargebacks? I have a $10k chargeback to make against sms company who sent messages on my behalf without my approval. I always lose all chargebacks so I would need some professional help with that, willing to pay commission for winning the chargeback
[22.12.23, 19:44:05] Marek Olszewski: Unfortunately it’s not possible. I tried it back in 2021 but something might have changed
[22.12.23, 20:39:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I saw it jeah, its not possible to change country in PayPal account.
[22.12.23, 20:39:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So i guess the only option (as i am going from a Dutch company to a UK company) is to open a new one
[22.12.23, 20:40:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And go to all the checks again 🥲
[23.12.23, 12:06:47] ~ Robin: Anyone here selling supplements?
[23.12.23, 12:50:39] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Perfect thank you ver much
[23.12.23, 12:51:43] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We win a lot of paypal case but pay even 30$
[23.12.23, 12:52:21] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Even and small transaction

We have many transactions at, for example, 12.99 and we pay $30.

[26.12.23, 14:26:24] ~ RS: Hey, how is your conversion rate these past 3 days? For me it dropped for more than 40%, and Also AOV has dropped 😀 Do you also scale down from the 24th-1st of January?
[26.12.23, 14:26:59] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah its definitely worse these days, but i have this every year between Christmas and NY
[26.12.23, 14:28:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I dont scale or test, but as long as they are break even or slightly profitable i dont touch my ads
[26.12.23, 14:29:43] ~ RS: Yeah, for me last 2 days are unprofitable 😀 havent had unprofitable day in over 45 days
[26.12.23, 14:51:10] ~ Zain Ahmed: we’re doing the same numbers w a long form vsl in facebook as before

but bf demolished us
[26.12.23, 15:40:05] ~ RS: BF was bad but Christmas days for me are very unprofitable 😀 yesterday -8% margin, today -40% margin. How long is your VSL? Im in the process of making my first VSL. Currently running only image ads that lead to advertorial. Done 500k in sales with just image ads from september
[26.12.23, 15:43:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone opened a Paypal on a UK company? For some reason because im in the netherlands probably, i cant seem to sign up, it just automatically sends me to a Dutch sign up and i cant change country.
[26.12.23, 15:58:12] ~ Kamal: Hey guys, where do you hire full time team members?
I've used upwork and onlinejobs in the past but I'm looking for smart people, for both creative strategy and also general VA/ all hats kind of work
[26.12.23, 16:00:41] ~ Harout: the most success weve had is by using our network. friends, friends of friends etc the screening is good and easier to find cheap talent but has its cons also
[26.12.23, 16:01:05] ~ Zain Ahmed: 30 mins. People do shorter VSLS, but this works for us. It's a high pain point niche (health) with an authority figure VSL. Kind of like mindvalley but not as good
[26.12.23, 16:02:06] ~ Zain Ahmed: GL on creating a VSL, it's a tricky process. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about it. There's a lot of steps to it and no returns for a while
[26.12.23, 16:02:15] ~ Luka: You do 30 min VSLs? Do you find it to be a lot more effective than shorter (5-10 min) VSLs?
[26.12.23, 16:02:47] ~ Luka: We're currently typically doing about 5-8 mins but are currently creating 10-15 min VSLs and then will try 20+ mins in length
[26.12.23, 16:03:08] ~ Zain Ahmed: I haven't done a shorter VSL successfully yet. I tried to get chatgpt to trim it down, but it didn't convert well. I'm going to give it another shot. I know peter kell says if the product is cheaper (~$50), a 7 min VSL is fine
[26.12.23, 16:03:21] ~ L: What’s mindvalley?
[26.12.23, 16:03:44] ~ Zain Ahmed: digital course brand that has amazing VSLS and top advertiser on yt/fb
[26.12.23, 16:04:35] ~ L: Thank you
[26.12.23, 16:04:55] ~ Luka: Interesting didn't know he mentioned that. Ours is a mid-tier priced product so in that case longer VSLs should perform better
[26.12.23, 16:04:59] ~ Luka: We test listicle vs direct, sometimes listicle wins, somethings direct wins
[26.12.23, 16:05:11] ~ RS: Thanks for info @⁨~Zain Ahmed⁩ 💪🏻
[26.12.23, 16:06:13] ~ Zain Ahmed: np bro lets get fucking rich
[26.12.23, 16:06:21] ~ L: I don’t know if it may help but I’m running 3/4 minutes VSL that point to an advertorial where there’s basically the same sales letter used as script for the Vsl - and then the product page
[26.12.23, 16:06:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: When i connect a new stripe account to a payment method in funnelish, does it change all the payment methods automatically to the new account? Or do have to do them 1 by 1
[26.12.23, 20:39:14] ~ L: Guys, is there a way to reduce VAT (IVA) when selling in countries like France/Germany? Some say it's impossible, but has anyone successfully optimized this? Wondering if it's worth consulting experts because many people claim it's not even worth listening to a consultant for this, as they say it's impossible
[26.12.23, 21:18:26] ~ Zain Ahmed: Does anyone here do facebook agency ad accounts? I would like to have a backup lined up just in case anything happens

[27.12.23, 9:34:17] ~ Maxi: Hey guys, when you test creatives, do you include UK; AU; CA, NZ in the same adset aswell or seperate them and have a  creative testing campaign for US and a second for the other GEOs ?
[27.12.23, 10:18:35] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys anyone have already tested 
Magicx or theoptimizer.io

For strong facebook rules and ai automation?
[27.12.23, 11:16:06] ~ Mikael: Hey fam,
What do you guys do with all the returns? like returns from other countrys etc. 
We sell worldwide but have returns sent back to sweden atm but we live in Spain.
[27.12.23, 18:49:52] ~ Brett Fallarino: We usually hit one market 1st and get it to $10k/day before testing others. We want to build our systems properly and seal any cracks before we miss out on maximizing revenue in the other countries ‎<This message was edited>
[27.12.23, 18:57:26] ~ Luka: @⁨~Brett Fallarino⁩ when you expand, do you do it 1 country at a time until each hits 10k too before moving to the next ?
[27.12.23, 19:04:27] ~ Brett Fallarino: We tested 1 country at a time. At $24k/day we went from US, to US & AU.

We duped our US Winners CBO to an AU CBO. Both CBO’s went to shit when we did this for some reason, so I recommend learning from my mistake and maybe rebuilding the CBO from scratch and swapping all the URL’s to AU URL from Shopify markets. We used the original US URL to maintain the ad engagement, but I think overall this hurt us. We’ll test again soon. 

Maybe someone more experienced wants to chime-in
[27.12.23, 19:07:10] ~ Luka: Thanks for the insight - useful to know
[27.12.23, 19:45:09] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Hey everyone, can someone please recommend some software to use for Tiktok affiliate marketing and influencer marketing? Thank you!
[28.12.23, 1:48:24] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Does anyone know how to fix so that my orders doesnt get captured automatically with Klarna merchant? They say that my order are getting captured right after the purchase which they shouldnt and that they will terminate my merchant if its not fixed? Cant see where I change this since its default.
[28.12.23, 2:16:14] ~ Dr Tim: guys how do you setup 'track my order' page if you're using cjdropshipping?
[28.12.23, 5:44:58] ~ Brett Fallarino: Hey guys, we encountered an issue recently that I'd like to brainstorm with you. We're dropshipping from China, so when customers want to return items, we usually offer them a 50% refund and they get to keep the item (This make things easier all around and take-rate is high). 

However with Facebook Shop, they do not allow us to send the customer 50% refunds, it has to be 100% from what we're seeing. Is there any workaround to this? Does anyone have a good system for Facebook Shop Return Requests? I'd love to brainstorm
[28.12.23, 10:13:31] ~ Robin: Hey guys, 

I’m trying to improve my customer support, anyone of y’all know how to train them? Any good tips? 

My VA are really open to learn and improve.
[28.12.23, 11:32:54] ~ Mikael: Anyone Selling to Norway? how did you fix the VAT number for Norway? so you can sell Battery Products to norway
[28.12.23, 12:00:15] ~ Santi Roa: Oh, interesting. You might  just lose those orders. How much as a % of your orders is it?
[28.12.23, 12:01:00] ~ Santi Roa: At the same time, you might start working on having a US warehouse. You will reduce shipping costs and they should be able to get returns so you won't lose those products
[28.12.23, 12:02:02] ~ Lachy Waldon: Anyone ever had a problem where loox isn’t showing on their site?

My store finally got reinstated and loox has disappeared from my site.
[28.12.23, 12:11:31] ~ Tim Alleraun: We had this issue once or twice. We just turned the app off and on again and that did the job
[28.12.23, 12:11:38] ~ Daniel Lai: yeah happens to me randomly sometimes, it’s something to do with their servers I think
[28.12.23, 12:12:21] ~ Lachy Waldon: Where do you turn off the app sorry
[28.12.23, 12:12:36] ~ Tim Alleraun: In your theme
[28.12.23, 12:12:55] ~ Lachy Waldon: oh yep i’ve tried that didn’t solve it unfortunately
[28.12.23, 12:13:57] ~ Lachy Waldon: any other reasons anyone can think of? Loox keep saying they can see it but i’ve tired on all devices + family and friends but doesn’t work
[28.12.23, 12:49:32] ~ Tarlan: @⁨~Dr Tim⁩ if you connected CJ to your shopify properly, it should sync all tracking numbers. 

If everything is correct, you should see tracking numbers on fulfilled order’s page in Shopify. 

Then you can use any tracking app, I use Track123. Just make sure you add CJ and CJ packet to carriers in setting.
[28.12.23, 13:06:18] ~ Tarlan: @⁨~Robin⁩ I created a couple of explanatory videos for my first VA, so that she can revisit them whenever needed. I trained and explained all the small details.

Later, when she needed help for customer service, she trained new hires. Now, while managing the onboarding process, she is handling more challenging customer tickets, PayPal disputes, and fulfillment.
[28.12.23, 13:10:40] ~ Santi Roa: We use an app called "ParcelPanel" it helps a lot
[28.12.23, 13:10:58] ~ Santi Roa: Customers can track their order by themselves and it's easy to use once it's embedded on the website
[28.12.23, 13:11:25] ~ RS: I use it too. Do you send out some emails to customers updating their about order progress etc?
[28.12.23, 13:12:16] ~ RS: This ParcelPanel also hides China locations etc, so customer doesnt really know that the package is coming from China
[28.12.23, 13:15:30] ~ Tarlan: all the orders, are synced from Funnelsih to shopify. 

However I’ve had couple orders that has not been synced. It’s 1/500 orders maybe. 

But we only find out if we cannot find customer’s order on shopify, after they contacs us for support. 

Most of the time customers contact us late, and request for order cancellation/refund. 

Has anyone encountered this problem and know how to fix it?
[28.12.23, 13:17:47] ~ Dr Tim: Thank you!
[28.12.23, 13:17:52] ~ RS: Yeah I have encountered this. Funnelish always say that it is not their fault, and this is shopify fault because of shopify downtime etc. Too many glitches in funnelish, and their support is not helpful. Need to try checkoutchamp
[28.12.23, 13:18:17] ~ Dr Tim: Thank you
[28.12.23, 13:20:39] ~ Kamal: I also have this issue occasionally. I have resorted to exporting all the orders every now and then from funnelish and Shopify and use chatgpt code analyzer to cross reference and find any missing ones. Usually a couple turn up
[28.12.23, 13:21:29] ~ Robin: Thanks man 👌🏻
[28.12.23, 13:46:13] ~ Tarlan: Unfortunately, too many glitches. Yeah, I’ve heard checkoutchamp works better and supports more payment gateways.
[28.12.23, 13:48:46] ~ Tarlan: Great idea! Can you still do it if you have upsells?
[28.12.23, 14:34:09] ~ Harout: anyone can recommend a great ecom accountant&tax advisor? our company is incorporated in Cyprus
[28.12.23, 14:34:41] ~ Bilel: I know someone
[28.12.23, 14:34:44] ~ Bilel: DM
[28.12.23, 14:35:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: A friend of mine has a dupe parfum brand, he is struggling a lot with profit %. He tried raising the price but that killed conversion rates as dupes are supposed to be cheap, he is trying different upsells and bundles also
[28.12.23, 14:35:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone has a tip?
[28.12.23, 14:51:59] ~ Kamal: What’s his AOV? 

I used to buy dupe parfums years back. He has to have good bundles and market the bundles, it will be hard to be profitable selling them individually. And offer free shipping at a certain amount, upsells, good email marketing and all that. 

Also you are right that they should be cheap but he could try to raise prices a bit and market it as a perfect/master replica or something along those lines.
[28.12.23, 15:56:50] ~ Haroon: yo guys can some of you send me some reliable suppliers that are trustworthy?

[28.12.23, 16:14:17] Marek Olszewski: I’ve been working with one for over 3 years now, processed tens of thousands of orders and never had any issues, I can intro you
[28.12.23, 16:15:31] ~ Haroon: Send me via DM
[28.12.23, 16:33:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: €36,71
[28.12.23, 16:43:04] Bob: Have you guys ever let people you know leave reviews on trustpilot? Can this be something bad to do?
[28.12.23, 16:44:44] ~ Brett Fallarino: About 3% of customers overall request returns.

Facebook Shop orders account for about 50% of our orders last 14 days
[28.12.23, 16:45:54] ~ Brett Fallarino: Yeah I think this would be a great option. We also have a feature we’d like to develop soon to CRUSH our competition. Might make us a stronger brand overall
[28.12.23, 17:31:09] ~ busy jon: hey guys anyone here managed to get the offshore status for the hong kong company?
[28.12.23, 19:36:26] ~ Daniel: Would anyone here happen to have a reliable BM supplier?
[28.12.23, 19:38:20] ~ Dr Tim: has anyone tried using only paypal as payment method if Stripe is falling because of 3D verification?
[28.12.23, 19:39:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Any dropshippers here who have succes with payment providers in UK (besides Stripe)?
[28.12.23, 19:39:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: like getting in
[28.12.23, 19:39:46] ~ RS: You use funnelish?
[28.12.23, 19:39:52] ~ Dr Tim: Yes
[28.12.23, 19:40:07] ~ L: I need it too, just got my BM disabled 15 mins ago
[28.12.23, 19:40:07] ~ Dr Tim: is that a problem with Stripe?
[28.12.23, 19:44:15] ~ RS: This is because of funnelish. I even was on a call with funnelish owner about the problem a few months ago. I sent them emails of the customers who had problems with 3DS. I sent these emails to funnelish support for a period of 2 months Maybe, but they did not came up with a solution and they never agreed that there is issue with funnelish so now I stopped informing them. If I see failed 3Ds, I send email to customer to place order in shopify. And then they successfully place their order in shopify with 3DS. Some customers Also said that they saw an error when they completed the 3DS with their bank. They saw an error in my website (funnelish showed that they failed to authentificate). It still happened today many times. It is what it is. Hope funnelish will invest in good developers that can fix this platform
Because it has a good potential
[28.12.23, 19:44:54] ~ Dr Tim: are you targeting UK?
[28.12.23, 19:45:26] ~ RS: Yes Also UK. And the problem is with UK because UK always need to compete 3DS. The same was Also for Norway
[28.12.23, 19:45:54] ~ Dr Tim: ah, I'm targeting UK only. Maybe this is part of my problem.
[28.12.23, 19:46:04] ~ Dr Tim: hence, thinking maybe switch to PayPal only?
[28.12.23, 19:46:41] ~ RS: Nope. The problem does not happen every time. Maybe only to some specific devices
[28.12.23, 19:54:32] Yaniv: Checkout.com
[28.12.23, 19:56:19] ~ Mike Ramsey: Is that isolated to just Stripe / Funnelish?  I haven’t heard of any of my clients complaining about that issue.  But they are using CKO for their payment processing.
[28.12.23, 19:57:35] ~ L: Is the 3DS issue a Shopify problem too? ‎<This message was edited>
[28.12.23, 20:03:04] ~ RS: Nop
[28.12.23, 20:04:10] ~ RS: I dont know man. I use stripe. Do you clients target UK and their customers need to complete 3DS as well?
[28.12.23, 20:28:31] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yes - into UK, EU.  I just checked into it and I am not seeing the same issue that you are encountering.  

Just pinged a couple partners about it and they didn’t say they were having issues.  Going to dig in a little more
[29.12.23, 0:40:27] ~ Mircea Cibric: Maybe there in Stripe settings, you need to activate 3DS? Or Funnelish should do it automatically?
[29.12.23, 1:02:40] ~ RS: Yeah, they should check if their customers are required to do the 3DS. In shopify, not every UK customer is asked to do the 3DS. Maybe there are some issues with stripe+funnelish on some devices, because these problems does not occur to all UK customers. Actually, it happens maybe to 1/15 of UK customers. I have checked some of the sessions with Microsoft clarity, and also some customers informed me, so there definitely is some issue that is still unknown. And from what I have heard in this group, this problem mostly occurs to guys who have European stripe and they target UK. We need to contact funnelish if we see some issues so they could investigate it further and maybe Get some solutions
[29.12.23, 10:06:52] ~ Maxi: Im moving from funnelish to checkout champ
[29.12.23, 10:07:00] ~ Maxi: not only because of that but its much better
[29.12.23, 10:23:05] ~ seth: yeah i'm also looking for an alternative for Funnelish since we can't find a way to fix the check-out poblem for over a month
[29.12.23, 10:24:10] ~ seth: @⁨~Maxi⁩ can i DM you some question bro?
[29.12.23, 10:56:26] ~ Kevin kreative: We followed Funnelish's advices
- Change payment processors, even processors are still good on Shopify > not work
- Test on total 4 Funnelish accounts > not work
- Change domain > not work
- Test build build from scratch (no clone funnel, everything from scratch) > not work
- Try to target single countries > not work

Before December, everything works normally ‎<This message was edited>
[29.12.23, 11:00:03] ~ Kevin kreative: I also was on call with him, showing our stats (Checkout Optin stays the same rate, but failed payment rate increase significantly).

We tried to convince him by all of the numbers we collect, but he didn't listen.
[29.12.23, 11:00:38] ~ David: Hello guys, Shopify has unexpectedly closed 5 stores, giving us as an argument a completely wrong and false policy, we have tried to contact them by chance, offering our collaboration and demonstrating that these policies are completely false and have not been breached and we have not received any help. for his part. Our customers are being harmed due to the closure of these stores, any recommendations on this? Can we legally report shopify with our legal team?
[29.12.23, 11:53:44] ~ Matteo S.R: The last guy who had that made a post on twitter and asked us to promote it, then it was resolved ‎<This message was edited>
[29.12.23, 11:54:16] ~ Matteo S.R: I mean X now
[29.12.23, 12:36:36] ~ seth: Hi does anyone have contact with Checkout Champ AM? 
I want to register for checkout champ but they require demo call which I can only schedule for next week.
[29.12.23, 14:35:07] ~ Maxi: https://www.nativecreatives.io/old-home
[29.12.23, 14:35:13] ~ Maxi: Anyone tried those guys ?
[29.12.23, 15:19:27] ~ Thomas Quinteros: ❗*FACEBOOK ADS WEBINAR*❗

Sup guys! 
In case you haven't seen my previous message:

Today's Facebook Ads call with Serhii will be suspended since Serhii will be travelling.

Next call back to normality!

Thanks for understanding🫡
[29.12.23, 16:44:22] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Who has a specialist or could help me

Since all this Anne 2023 we struggle with persistent disputes

The cost of these disputes represents 7% of our sales every day.

No matter how much we improve our product, our customer satisfaction rate is 4 and trust pilot 3.4

We have too many disputes, and this is costing us dearly


For 2024 I want to improve this, do you have anyone to recommend?
[29.12.23, 16:46:37] Topi: Will pm
[29.12.23, 17:15:52] ~ lengjoo: Where do you guys hire your video editors from? (we currently use UpWork and OnlineJobs)
Also, if you have anyone qualified that you don't need, we'd love a referral 😂
[29.12.23, 18:50:23] ~ Santi Roa: Bro, this is extremely high.

Where are you selling? Where are you shipping from?
How much volume/month? 
How many people in CS do you have?
What's your average ticket response time?
Are you over-selling your product? Or faking benefits that are not true?
[29.12.23, 18:53:12] ~ Santi Roa: I don't think you need an specialist in disputes or this, just keep asking yourself the right questions, and gather the right data.
There are only 3 reasons why this happens
1) Your product sucks
2) Your operations suck
3) Your marketing is too aggressive and misleading
[29.12.23, 18:55:14] ~ Santi Roa: Have you asked the customers why they dispute? What are their answers?
Is there a similar product on the market? What's their price compared to yours? How's their quality? How are their reviews?
[29.12.23, 18:56:00] ~ Santi Roa: If you can respond to these questios here I am sure many of us from the grup can give you guidance. Even though, the answer might come from you once you ask those questions and look for the data
[29.12.23, 19:08:37] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ are you able to help here.

@⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩ alternately it could be claims of the product on the front end. This is very high dispute %. We are always aiming for 1% or below
[29.12.23, 19:11:22] ~ LA: Check out the chargeback reason codes in your CRM. Is there a fraud reason code? Normally, there will be a pattern (eg. Customer didn't receive product, credit not processed, goods/services not as described, fraud, subscription not cancelled etc). Manually review the reasons. ‎<This message was edited>
[29.12.23, 19:12:10] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yep - no problem
[29.12.23, 19:12:12] ~ Sam O: 7% dispute rate is untenable... No payment gateway will ever keep you with this level
[29.12.23, 19:14:10] ~ Sam O: I think you have to do what @⁨~Santi Roa⁩ suggested and overhaul the way your doing things 

Good luck

Btw you need to get the dispute rate below 1% per month or you will always get shut down
[29.12.23, 19:14:49] ~ Sam O: Ideally they want you below 0.5% dispute rate
[29.12.23, 19:15:15] ~ Sam O: That's the rules and threshold Visa and MasterCard set
[29.12.23, 19:15:36] ~ Mike Ramsey: Or even worse, you end up on MATCH list
[29.12.23, 19:15:54] ~ Maxi: You could go to a high risk processor until you figure out the things.
[29.12.23, 19:17:27] ~ Sam O: Even high risk payment processor will frown at 7% ... That's untenable.

High risk payment processors are much more willing but with 7% charge back rate your terms will be trash.

For sure they will put a 10% - 20% revenue hold for 90 days ... I can promise you this
[29.12.23, 19:46:21] ~ Maxi: 20% hold for MID lifetime and release after closure are usually tje terms 😂 

20% for 90 days is to generous hahaha
[29.12.23, 22:32:20] ~ Kamal: Hey guys I've been using Funnelish for a month (stripe + paypal for checkout), and refunding orders in Shopify when a customer wants a refund. I just now realized that none of those orders are actually getting refunded and I have to do it through Stripe or Paypal manually. 

I have $5000 in refunds I need to process. Should I do them gradually? I'm worried doing it all at once is going to trigger something.
[29.12.23, 22:43:01] ~ Y: do it gradually just in case, also for stripe orders you can refund them from within funnelish itself. PayPal orders need to be refunded from paypal.
[29.12.23, 22:47:33] ~ Kamal: Will do, thanks
[30.12.23, 4:02:34] ~ Santiago: Hey guys does anyone has a method to do usa tiktok organic while being abroad? Some time ago i saw a vpn protocol on skool but cant find it
‎[30.12.23, 6:17:15] ~ Brett Fallarino: ‎video omitted
[30.12.23, 6:35:42] ~ Santiago: Thanks bro 😎
[30.12.23, 7:37:07] ~ Sang: try tiktok creative challenge , cost savings for UGC videos, market-driven, require = 10k in spending. Winning rate about 5%. https://ads.tiktok.com/creativechallenge
[30.12.23, 9:36:54] ~ Robin: Hey guys, 

I’m thinking of starting a Dubai company and operate my brand thru it. But I will also have a 5 year exit plan for the brand.

By running the company via Dubai, will it be negative for an exit?
[30.12.23, 9:42:04] ~ Mikael: How will you do with Klarna? will you have klarna through Swedish Company? or does ti work with Dubai?
[30.12.23, 9:43:30] ~ Robin: Either use my Swedish company for selling in countries with Klarna, or also set up a Hongkong company for Klarna
[30.12.23, 11:04:42] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I found my first copycat using all my mockup photos, can i do a DMCA for that? How do i do that on Facebook & funnelish?
[30.12.23, 11:06:18] ~ Luka: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/copyrightform
[30.12.23, 11:06:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thanks!
[30.12.23, 11:06:58] ~ Luka: This is if the advertiser is using your assets to run ads (images/videos/clips). Don't think FB takes down an advertiser if your assets are on the advertisers website... as that's not FB hosted
[30.12.23, 11:07:34] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah he is using my mockup photos to advertise (he only blurred the label partly)
[30.12.23, 11:08:00] ~ Daniel Lai: anyone else experiencing delays with getting responses from submitting this form recently?
[30.12.23, 11:08:05] ~ Luka: Should be an easy takedown then
[30.12.23, 12:59:10] ~ Robin: Anyone that can recommend a good designer for Shopify?
[30.12.23, 14:03:21] ~ Tim Alleraun: Who’s in Thailand/Bangkok next year? We will be there in March & April. Happy to meet y’all!
[30.12.23, 15:50:22] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you very much for your reply bro, we struggle the whole year

- Volume/months ~ 500-800k
- Cs: we have 3 people
- About 6h 
- difficult to say 

1) product is very good we have only dispute in English market French and Spanish are okay
2) what KPI did you looking for for this?
3) maybe, how to know this?

Most customers don't reply to our e-mails about their dispute.

Many report fraud


Yes, there are similar products on the market
And the competitors have a trust pilot of 4.4 and a similar price.


We order their product and compare it to the other and clear exactly the same thing, see we're better we spent to improve the product too


Note: we have introduce new brand 3 month later and product is good and we still have a lot of dispute in English market
[30.12.23, 15:51:05] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: @⁨~Santi Roa⁩
[30.12.23, 15:52:29] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ thank we are in touch with @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ 

Maybe we've checked it many times
We'll have to work on it in depth
[30.12.23, 15:53:00] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Fraud 80% of time
[30.12.23, 15:53:46] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Is not 7% of dispute

Is for each sales dispute + refund cost us about 7% so is very high to be profitable
[30.12.23, 15:54:55] ~ Luka: @⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩ Probably all fine but is your statement descriptor obvious that it's your shop? like your domain
[30.12.23, 15:55:45] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Yes
[30.12.23, 15:56:05] ~ Santi Roa: Are you using your own content/marketing? Or ripping off other brand?
[30.12.23, 15:56:07] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you for your help guys
[30.12.23, 15:56:24] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Yes I can show to you in private if you want
[30.12.23, 15:56:48] ~ Santi Roa: Sure I can give you my point of view,  just shot me a message
[30.12.23, 15:56:51] ~ Luka: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ONzyqHH-k50
[30.12.23, 15:57:04] ~ Luka: Found this video for you, watched it a long time ago and remembered it now
[30.12.23, 15:57:18] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank
[30.12.23, 15:59:16] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: But on Shopify payment how to see The details of the disputes?
[30.12.23, 16:23:45] ~ Maxi: @⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩ 

Have you tried calling the customers who placed a chargeback / dispute for fraud ?


Maybe there are patterns and it might lead to a solution.

Especially if you use upsells they think immediately it’s a scam usually.


We implemented a short disclaimer in our order notification:

Which name the customer will see as the charge 

That there might be multiple charges and why 

Our number and mail in bold so they can call asap
[30.12.23, 16:24:52] ~ Maxi: For us 90% of fraud came from the US
[31.12.23, 1:42:25] ~ John: anyone know how to send a DMCA to a funnnelish store?
[31.12.23, 4:08:14] ~ Luka: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyKzJIppfQw great interview
[31.12.23, 5:58:49] ~ seth: Anyone have a share Checkout Champ funnel?
[31.12.23, 11:26:02] Topi: Anyone know someone that is an expert with EU imports? Would need contact for some questions. Thank you in advance.
[31.12.23, 12:11:50] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I just messaged them
[31.12.23, 12:11:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I think they can send the DMCA file
[31.12.23, 12:59:40] ~ Tarlan: Happy New Year, everyone! I hope you all have a great year, full of achievements and great memories.

Hopefully, everyone will at least double their daily sales and start making a million dollars in profit! Let’s crush it in 2024! 🎉🚀

[1.01.24, 21:23:12] ~ Tim Alleraun: Just wondering, how did Jan the 1st go so far for you guys in terms of revenue and profit?
[1.01.24, 21:24:10] ~ Robert Gonzalez: it's 12:20pm here, so barely starting haha but it's off to a good start, i lowered the ad spend tho like 50%
[1.01.24, 21:30:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Didnt touch my ads, not great but still profitable though
[1.01.24, 21:39:53] ~ Tim Alleraun: Thanks for the insight, how about the rest? For us it completely went to shit. 4.5% CVR to 2%😶‍🌫️
[1.01.24, 21:42:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah for me CTR of salespage went from 37% to 28% also (while my cpc lowered and my CPM is super super low in Germany today)
[1.01.24, 21:42:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: CVR also very very low, 1.5% i believe
[1.01.24, 21:43:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But its not strange
[1.01.24, 21:44:30] ~ Daniel Lai: I didnt touch my ads, profit margin went from around 30% to 15% and CPMs in USA dropped by 40%
[1.01.24, 21:44:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah its normal
[1.01.24, 21:45:04] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Cpm already lowered around Christmas but today lol
[1.01.24, 21:45:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: In Germany on VSLs CPM of €3
[1.01.24, 21:45:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 😅😂
[1.01.24, 21:46:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Does anyone know how to file a DMCA on funnelish? They give me a hard time telling me to come with lawyers lol
[1.01.24, 21:46:16] Bob: I have the same on my CPM’s today. 

Performance was not good in the beginning of the day but picked up
[1.01.24, 21:52:33] ~ Tim Alleraun: Excited for tomorrow, today was complete garbage🤣
[1.01.24, 21:53:15] Bob: Yeah I hope it will be better as well haha, just happy it picked up today already, so that’s a good sign
[2.01.24, 5:30:02] ~ seth: Hi, anyone have contact to a Checkout champ dev or a share CC funnel? I'm finding this challenging to use. 🤣
[2.01.24, 11:22:43] ~ Luka: Had the same issue, not a simple software at all. If you go on Upwork and type "checkout champ" or similar, you'll find 1 freelancer dev guy who can set it up for you
[2.01.24, 14:56:09] ~ Harout: anyone could recommend a reliable service to get set up in the US fast and cost-effectively? looking for full package service including yearly obligations, accounting etc. cheers 🙏
[2.01.24, 14:58:04] ~ Luka: We used https://www.delawareinc.com/ they're great & fast.

For yearly filings (federal) we use https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~017bef96c1bcf179e2 it's $150 per LLC
[2.01.24, 14:59:49] ~ Harout: thanks will check it out!
[2.01.24, 16:48:57] ~ Allan L: Hey.
I've received a few PMs about adspying on a competitioner the last 2 weeks.
Just letting everyone know that right now my fb insider is doing a little new year sale, so can get them extra cheap in case anyone is interested in seeing what their competitioner is doing in their campaigns, adsets and ads.
[2.01.24, 16:56:30] ~ Mohammed-amine: Looks like Google has completely shut down Google Optimize. Curious, what you guys are currently using for CRO A/B testing?
[2.01.24, 16:59:46] ~ David: Anyone here selling with woocomerce instead of shopify?
[2.01.24, 16:59:54] ~ Luka: Yep we do woocommerce
[2.01.24, 17:00:32] ~ David: it is better right?
[2.01.24, 17:00:50] ~ David: In order of integrations and payment processors
[2.01.24, 17:02:19] ~ Luka: Shopify is a lot simpler & user-friendly, but WooCommerce we use because
- 100% Customizable Checkout
- 100% Customizable Upsell Pages without limitations
- More payment Processors (incl. Bank Transfer & COD)
- No Shopify Fees

We use this app with Woo: https://funnelkit.com/
[2.01.24, 17:07:40] ~ David: Thank you Luka
[2.01.24, 17:08:09] ~ David: @⁨~Luka⁩ do you use this as a page builder of woocomerce right?
[2.01.24, 17:12:27] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: You have 
- Convert
- Howuku (cheap like convert and great too)
[2.01.24, 17:14:08] ~ Harout: ABConvert shopify app is pretty good and affordable, works for us 👍
[2.01.24, 17:22:25] ~ Maxi: Guys what’s your plan for CNY ?

We have stock but in China which makes things not quite better.

Stopping the sales ?

Giving customers an info for delayed fulfillment ?

Giving customers a gift such as free ebook or 1x extra product as compensation ?
[2.01.24, 17:24:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: How long is your supplier closed? I also have stock in China but they are only closed 3 days
[2.01.24, 17:24:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So i dont change anything
[2.01.24, 17:25:11] ~ Maxi: From 8th to 16th

He will fulfill orders on 12th once
[2.01.24, 17:28:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i see
[2.01.24, 17:28:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i mean its not too bad, i wouldnt shut it all down
[2.01.24, 17:29:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: but make sure to keep your customers up to date through e-mail
[2.01.24, 17:29:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: like there is a small delay because of high demand or something
[2.01.24, 17:31:37] ~ Luka: It itself is not a page builder but rather a funnelbuilder.  The page builders they offer are Elementor, Divi, Oxygen & Gutenberg. We use elementor.

FunnelKit is used to build out the funnel, add upsells, order bumps, and other stuff including integrating with Klaviyo, SMS softwares and all that
[2.01.24, 17:34:16] ~ Luka: You can update your page to say it's a pre-order. That's what we did for our US brand while slowing down the budget a lot.

For our other non-US brand, what we do when ran out of stock (not related to CNY), we don't actually mention on our LP that it's a pre-order but rather on the checkout page (we have no cart page).

However we never tested 2 weeks pre-order but rather a maximum of 1 week, and shipping takes 1-3 days here. In some cases it actually boosted our conversion rate.
[2.01.24, 17:35:08] ~ Luka: Our message was that due to very high demand, we ran out of stock. However you can still order today to claim your discount price and we'll have it shipped out as soon as we restock (estimated date: xyz)

If you have an evergreen discount, it'll work. If you don't have any discount, perhaps consider giving a discount as an incentive ‎<This message was edited>
[2.01.24, 17:40:57] ~ Maxi: Good idea
[2.01.24, 17:41:08] ~ Maxi: I’ll add a banner on top aswell
[2.01.24, 17:41:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i did that last year as well, worked great too
[2.01.24, 17:41:20] ~ Maxi: So they can’t complain that they haven’t been informed
[2.01.24, 17:41:26] ~ Maxi: And on thank you page aswell
[2.01.24, 17:51:07] ~ Brett Fallarino: Dexter for Price A/B testing.

Convert.com for A/B testing & split-testing
[2.01.24, 18:17:02] ~ Harout: can anyone recommend a great tax advisor? we have a company in Cyprus looking to set up in the US as well
[2.01.24, 18:45:32] ~ Santi Roa: If you're getting consistent sales, ship some units to a local warehouse. Not only to avoid CNY delays but to offer a better experience ‎<This message was edited>
[2.01.24, 18:47:01] ~ L: Would any of you like to share their business structure to optimize VAT in Europe?

I’m talking to 2 accountants but neither of them seems to know what they’re talking about
[2.01.24, 18:51:45] ~ Ignasi: DM me. Not sure if my structure will be helpful but I’ll be very happy to provide details
[2.01.24, 18:52:06] ~ Ignasi: We’re an EU company.
[2.01.24, 20:23:23] Topi: Hello guys, any proven suppliers for fb profiles? Ours dissapeared
[2.01.24, 20:23:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i got you
[2.01.24, 22:04:51] Matán Intsuper: What does it mean disappeared ?
[2.01.24, 23:02:57] ~ Daniel Lai: did anyone’s revenue / profit start to pick up today, or are they still a lot lower?  personally mine got a bit worse than yesterday😂
[2.01.24, 23:03:29] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Mine is a little better today
[2.01.24, 23:03:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: but nothing too spectacular
[2.01.24, 23:04:03] ~ Kamal: Same, was doing well all throughout christmas and new year and today I got destroyed 😂
[2.01.24, 23:05:05] ~ Daniel Lai: yeah christmas day and new year’s eve, we’re even significantly better for me than today😂
[2.01.24, 23:09:32] ~ Tim Alleraun: Same, we will start launching again tomorrow. Let’s see how it goes 🚀
[2.01.24, 23:12:29] ~ Daniel Lai: hope they go well🙏🏼
[2.01.24, 23:18:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Same, didnt launch since Christmas Eve
[2.01.24, 23:18:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: My cpms were all over the place
[2.01.24, 23:35:30] ~ Tim Alleraun: The days before and on Christmas Eve we only had ~10% after VAT. But the days after Christmas Eve until the 31st were crazy profitable. On the 1st we then went from 20k daily to 7k with -500€ in one night 😂 now we are at 3k 🫣
[2.01.24, 23:56:33] Topi: same pattern here
[3.01.24, 12:19:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hi, urgent question: 

I am operating on UK since first of January, and my paypal got instant perma blocked for some reason
[3.01.24, 12:19:34] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i only did 2.4k in revenue through it, gave them all the information they asked for and they decided to perma block it, what can i do now?
[3.01.24, 12:19:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: opening a new one would probably not work
[3.01.24, 12:30:49] ~ Robin: Hey guys, 

Is there anyone that can recommend a mentor for building brands?
[3.01.24, 12:31:35] ~ Luka: Ezra Firestone has great content on that
[3.01.24, 12:41:21] ~ Kevin kreative: use Mentor Pass and check all brand building related podcasts
[3.01.24, 12:54:50] ~ Robin: Thank you for the advice, I will check it out
[3.01.24, 17:48:54] ~ Kamal: Hey guys I want to add one of my VA's to my fb ad manager so he can upload new ads / adjust things.

I'm worried bc he's located in the Phillipines and FB is quick to ban  - has anyone done this before? are they any issues with multiple team members accessing fb ad manager from different countries?
[3.01.24, 17:50:59] ~ G M: Add him just as editor, and its ok
[3.01.24, 17:57:46] ~ Kamal: Thanks
[3.01.24, 18:04:08] ~ David: Anyone here working with Ocean Payments?
[3.01.24, 18:10:08] ~ Tim Alleraun: How do you do that? Is there any way to let a VA create new ads and adjust everything but not publish? So I can review it before publishing
[3.01.24, 18:11:36] ~ Mike Ramsey: I am familiar with them and their offerings, but I don’t personally use them
[3.01.24, 19:06:13] ~ Kamal: Not sure but I think they have to publish and turn off, I don't think you can view other peoples drafts
[3.01.24, 19:16:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: you cant view drafts indeed
[3.01.24, 19:17:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is it reviewing for compliance? Or just to check quality of the work? Otherwise you can just let them plan it 2 days/3 days from today and you have time to review it before it goes live
[3.01.24, 19:41:04] ~ G M: You can do that if you use the same profile with same proxy and same dolphin anty account saved on cloud. (Or if you have premium plan using team member etc)

But its doable
[3.01.24, 19:41:22] ~ Brett Fallarino: Maybe have them schedule all ads 1-2 days out so you have time to review before launch

Just a quick announcement: my Facebook ads will be happening on Thursday (Jan 4) instead of Friday (Jan 5) this week.
Time for the call with be from 12:30 PM EST until 4:30 PM EST. Looking forward to seeing you!
Serhii
[4.01.24, 14:26:12] ~ Marko: Does anyone have experience selling very high ticket products? Between 10 and 50k. Would love to chat to anyone that has experience
[4.01.24, 16:25:55] ~ Santi Roa: Are you currently selling anything that expensive? What volume?

Got a friend selling 10k items, he was doing high numbers
[4.01.24, 16:47:34] ~ Marko: Working together with someone who is selling a product for 48k. Sold 18 pieces so far
[4.01.24, 17:43:26] ~ Tim Alleraun: Nice, thanks for the insight!
[4.01.24, 17:49:05] ~ Zain Ahmed: Anyone use funnelish with google search ads to scoop up traffic that's been warmed up by FB already?

Have some questions
[4.01.24, 17:51:11] Matán Intsuper: Google performance max shopping campaign back to Shopify works well
[4.01.24, 18:32:32] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Hey guys, when do you start seeing better results?😅
[4.01.24, 18:36:19] ~ Tim Alleraun: Interested aswell. Performance so far sucks this year
[4.01.24, 18:37:14] ~ Daniel Lai: I scaled back a bit and my profit is hovering around 20% still, it was normally around 30% profit on higher revenues
[4.01.24, 18:52:22] ~ Zain Ahmed: Do you use sales or traffic campaigns? We are only interested in scooping up people who search the name of our product ATM
[4.01.24, 19:29:58] ~ Mubasel: My store in australia starts to peform a little better since yesterday, but the peformance in germany sucks
[4.01.24, 20:33:58] ~ Tim Alleraun: Germany is trash. BE only atm
[4.01.24, 21:12:54] ~ Bilel: We should be ready for high CPMs this year because of elections
[4.01.24, 21:13:07] ~ Bilel: Especially in US
[4.01.24, 21:26:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Selling in Germany on a low scale, got better since yesterday
[4.01.24, 21:32:19] Yaniv: your CPM depends on your niche it has nothing to do with elections you are competing in the auction against others in the same category.
[5.01.24, 5:02:10] ~ Lareina: Hi 👋 is anyone connecting multiple Shopify stores using the same PayPal to accept payment? Will that cause any freeze or hold? Or has to create a different PayPal account for different store? Thanks!
[5.01.24, 5:05:42] ~ Luka: Elections do increase CPMs actually. Election ads are not only 1 niche but it's generally targeting all Americans with crazy budgets impacting CPMs across many niches. It would also be smart to expect volatility in sales/conversion rates depending how things go as people's emotional states are all over the place especially since this election is probably the most important one in humanity's history
[5.01.24, 5:06:15] ~ Luka: It's also the most expensive election ever
[5.01.24, 5:20:43] ~ Brett Fallarino: Hey guys, how do you split-test Fulfillment Agents? We've had our guy for some months, but we need lower COGS. We want to keep the relationship strong as back-up
[5.01.24, 6:29:53] ~ Matt: I do and i haven’t had troubles
[5.01.24, 7:47:49] ~ Mubasel: I use the same account for differnet stores across different countries, and I also haven‘t had any troubles
[5.01.24, 11:28:05] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys! I have one fb ad acc that is hitting a 5k daily limit. Do you know how to increase it?
[5.01.24, 11:31:13] ~ Alex: If it’s an agency ad account just keep hitting the limit for a few days and it should increase eventually
[5.01.24, 11:31:30] ~ Alejandro H.: Nice!
[5.01.24, 11:42:17] ~ Maxi: What helps according to my agency:

Lower the treshold to $20

Annoying because of many transactions but it might help 👍🏻
[5.01.24, 11:44:43] ~ Luka: Long shot but does anyone here have a Chinese agent who has experience & contacts in the Car Tire 🛞 industry ?
[5.01.24, 11:57:49] ~ Santi Roa: Where did you get that information from?
[5.01.24, 11:59:49] ~ Peter: Very true
[5.01.24, 11:59:55] ~ Santi Roa: Political advertising won't do like "oh let's exclude the baby niche and all interest related to mothers"
They'll probably deploy huge amounts of money all over different ages, platforms, interests, etc
[5.01.24, 12:19:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: When would you guys say frequency is high on ads?
[5.01.24, 13:42:36] ~ Ignasi: You can open a chat with them and request it. It sometimes works
[5.01.24, 16:54:18] Matán Intsuper: hey guys, is there a recommended agency fb ads account? we have too many issues with the personal accounts recently which disrupt the flow of the business and its impossible to scale (too many rejections, pages restricted, personal accounts restricted from advertising) - happens daily.
[5.01.24, 17:12:03] ~ Harout: DM me have a great one
[5.01.24, 17:16:23] Matán Intsuper: dmed
[5.01.24, 20:53:47] ~ Kyle Alexander: Any issues with starting to test ads on the weekend?
Or is it better to start tests on a monday?
[5.01.24, 21:07:03] ~ Brett Fallarino: Just make good ads and it doesn’t matter ‎<This message was edited>
[5.01.24, 21:07:47] ~ Brett Fallarino: However, we do avoid launching ads right before holidays or during ‎<This message was edited>
[5.01.24, 21:43:26] ~ Kyle Alexander: Thanks Brett 😊
[6.01.24, 8:01:03] ~ Jeromy Day: ‎This message was deleted.
[6.01.24, 12:20:16] ~ Tarlan: @⁨~Alejandro H.⁩ I’ve had same issue for 2 month. When scheduled over 5k for first time, the next day it stopped spending at 700 and it slowly increased to 5k within a week. Agency contacted support many times but no increase. They just assigned me new ad account with same info.
[6.01.24, 12:22:04] ~ Tarlan: Does anyone have recommendation for phone customer support service in different languages, that charges per ticket or per minute?
[6.01.24, 14:18:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hi! Is it possible to use Paypal through Stripe with funnelish?
[6.01.24, 14:24:44] ~ Maxi: Paypal through stripe ?

Is that a thing ?
[6.01.24, 14:25:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For UK, yes
[6.01.24, 14:25:03] ~ Jeremy Leppink: UK stripe
[6.01.24, 14:25:06] ~ Santi Roa: It doesn't change a lot in terms of testing the creatives, it might change in terms of performance so you have to keep that in mind

For that reason, we analyze every single week and understand performance by days, and then we test creatives in our strongest days
[6.01.24, 14:26:17] ~ Santi Roa: Otherwise if I dump 80 creatives/week on the bad performance day (Tuesdays), the results end badly
[6.01.24, 14:29:24] ~ Kyle Alexander: Thanks Santi
I’ve got the auto rules in place in case an ad isn’t performing
[6.01.24, 14:30:41] ~ Santi Roa: Don't kill it too early otherwise it's not a,test it would be a test for luck
[6.01.24, 14:30:48] ~ Santi Roa: I leave it 3 days no touch
[6.01.24, 14:30:55] ~ Santi Roa: Sometimes it takes time to peak yp
[6.01.24, 14:30:56] ~ Santi Roa: Up
[6.01.24, 14:31:05] ~ Santi Roa: That's why I launch creative testing on Fridays
[6.01.24, 14:31:23] ~ Santi Roa: So they go untouched the best 3 days (friday, sat, sund)
[6.01.24, 14:32:20] ~ Kyle Alexander: Thanks
I’ve got 3 scrollstoppers per hook
(3 ads per adset) and £30 daily spend per adset
[6.01.24, 16:43:10] ~ Nicco: thank you for sharing your strategy, however for the budget how do you manage it?
[6.01.24, 16:53:22] ~ Mikael: Anyone know/used someone thats legit and can add positive reviews to google and trustpilot for our ecom store?
[6.01.24, 16:53:52] Topi: pm bro
[6.01.24, 19:31:30] Radek: 100% agree. I see also quite beneficial that our creative team gets used to work in regular weekly cycles, which increased their productivity
[7.01.24, 5:16:09] ~ Dr Tim: Anyone know where I can buy affordable ID verified fb profiles especially for UK (if that makes a difference)?
[7.01.24, 9:59:25] ~ Sam O: 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨Anyone got discount tickets for sale for affiliate world Dubai ?
[7.01.24, 10:01:36] ~ Luka: Not sure of a seller but an option is you can find students or so, pay them $50-$100/mo to use their FB Profile. Buy a cheap laptop to their address, setup teamviewer and the first week, browse normally for the first week and then start running ads.

Make sure they're aware you'll need their ID for verification
[7.01.24, 10:05:27] ~ Brett Fallarino: @⁨~Dr Tim⁩ you can either use Luka's method, or you can use Friends & Family accounts + Anti-detect browser such as Incognition + Proxy. This worked the best for me. I use proxy-cheap, but I heard other guys are using better proxies. I wouldn't go with proxy-cheap twice
[7.01.24, 10:07:13] ~ Brett Fallarino: Some broke guys will even let you use their Facebook for $20/month (Ideally guys that don't use their Facebook much). Just build the trust with them and be transparent. You should be good
[7.01.24, 16:37:15] ~ Santi Roa: I do
[7.01.24, 16:53:51] ~ Malik: Hi guys, so with the failed payments on Funnelish in the French market I decided to try to sell only using Shopify. 

- 2023 my CVR on Funnelish was on average at 3%
- Last 30 days on Shopify, 1.2%

I'm selling health related products. Are you guys having the same difference between the 2 platforms ? 

I will test again on Funnelish, maybe the failed payments won't be a problem anymore but I would like to find ways to have a better CVR on Shopify.
[7.01.24, 16:54:24] ~ Malik: I'm still profitable at 1.2% but it's a huge difference
[7.01.24, 18:14:25] ~ Y: Notify me if still seeing elevated failed transactions on funnelish

[8.01.24, 0:46:22] Bob: What kind of payment providers do you use? 

I’m in the Scandinavian market and used to have Klarna with stripe and a lot of failed payments, but once we switched to Klarna merchant we rarely have failed payments. Haven’t done any test with Shopify, but wanted to test it as well to see the difference in performance
[8.01.24, 1:41:29] ~ Tarlan: I had same problem with Klarna by Stripe. Although I contacted Stripe 10 times, they did not solve it. 

How long did it take you to get approved for Klarna?

I have UK and US entity. I applied with UK entity but did not get any response. 

Any recommendations on how to get EU Klarna merchant for non-EU citizens?
[8.01.24, 2:34:26] ~ Mike Ramsey: Update *Elevated payment failures (UK / EU)for 3ds on funnelish / Stripe appears to be isolated to that.  I ran tests with multiple partners that I set up with checkout.com and no reported issues whatsoever.
[8.01.24, 2:36:26] Bob: Yeah I know, Stripe didn’t help me at all either. I got approved straight away, but that could be because I have a Swedish company.
[8.01.24, 2:43:48] ~ Tarlan: I’ve noticed increased failed transactions as well. 

In that case, is it better to turn off 3ds, until you have a new merchant/solution?
[8.01.24, 2:49:08] ~ Mike Ramsey: Turning off entirely can be dangerous due to fraud - you’ll need to keep heavy eye on it.  You can do it for short time but also implement chargeback management as well.
[8.01.24, 3:04:24] ~ RS: Me too. 15%+ decline rate
[8.01.24, 3:35:10] ‪+357 97 611328‬: We also have high declines. We were told it's because the company of incorporation is different to the market we sell in
[8.01.24, 4:35:24] ~ Brett Fallarino: Is anyone successfully running TikTok shop while dropshipping?
[8.01.24, 4:52:38] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yep - standard cross border / failure rates ~ 10-15% on average
[8.01.24, 4:57:18] ~ Santiago: Yo guys looking for a TT ad editor for my in-house team, if anybody knows someone I’d really appreciate the referral (not looking for much skill just someone proactive)
[8.01.24, 10:53:54] ~ Tarlan: Has anyone got Klarna with Irish company? If so, how long did it take to get approved? 

As I know, Ireland is the only EU country that allows you to create EU based company for foreigners. Cheapest one I found was 2k, just to create Irish entity.
[8.01.24, 11:07:05] ~ Alex: Yeah I have it. Took less than a week
[8.01.24, 11:10:04] ~ Kevin kreative: how to form Irish company? Can you share the reference?
[8.01.24, 11:10:05] ~ Kevin kreative: Thanks
[8.01.24, 12:47:15] ~ Tarlan: Does it have reasonable transaction failure rate?
[8.01.24, 14:41:42] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Are there people here using HK shopify payments?
[8.01.24, 14:48:15] ~ Tarlan: https://www.companyformations.ie/

https://www.nathantrust.com/

I did not work with them but I’ve save these 2. 

So would be best to do your research and contact them directly.

[8.01.24, 17:48:39] ~ LA: Yes I did that when it came out years ago. It’s an easy process but you need to go to the consulate so it takes longer. The advantage is you get access to Estonian banks.

However, beyond that, for tax purposes, other countries are more favorable.

For banking, there are many options for EU residents/citizens. For non EU residents, Wise is no longer accepting (for now). So there are other options. ‎<This message was edited>

[8.01.24, 19:32:09] ~ Dr Tim: Guys is it okay for CS to call failed payment customers or you only send email?

Anyone tried calling customers to try get a payment through?
[8.01.24, 19:46:34] ~ Ignasi: It works really well !
[8.01.24, 19:47:07] ~ Dr Tim: Okay... Any idea what kind of script you'd follow?
[8.01.24, 19:48:38] ~ Ignasi: We generally say something like

“We’ve seen you had trouble checking out. We wonder if you had any technical difficulties. Etc”

We always offer a coupon “to make up for any technical problems” and email them or text them a link to their checkout with  the discount applied
[8.01.24, 19:48:38] ~ Tarlan: Thank you so much, Leon!
[8.01.24, 19:49:04] ~ Ignasi: This actually works really well for abandoned checkouts

We recently duped our store into some other countries.

Our emails are going straight into trash which obviously affects the conversion rate as abandoned checkout emails recovers basically 0%. 

Does anyone know

- Why this happens?
- How to fix this?

Thank you in advance
[8.01.24, 22:57:50] ~ Kyle Twohill: Hey guys quick question, im making a new store right now and adding some AliExpress products to it for testing etc. Most products will be like $3.00 but have $20.00 slashed out as a "welcome deal" for example. Is the product really going to be 20.00 after the first purchase?

The ESS copy call starts in 50 minutes.  

(3pm UK Time)
(10 AM EST)

I've seen a few questions here asking about branding so this will be a quick crash course in branding and a chance for you to ask any questions you have about branding. 

Hope to see as many of you there as possible.
[9.01.24, 17:05:17] ~ David B: Here is the link for the copy call https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BIh2d3fMT8upuW35q_8fxQ

[9.01.24, 18:33:35] ~ Kyle Alexander: Hey guys, do you know anyone who might be interested in this deal?

We're open to having another investor on board to give a bit more breathing room whilst we cut costs and grow sales. 

My co-investor is retired and has done £100m+ in deals. Good to have him on board when it comes time to exit in 3 years. 

We bought the business in mid 2021. It had no website, no marketing and only 1 sales rep.

Now we've got a slick website, B2B sales portal, growing independent sales team (7+), Top Rated eBay store and a growing Amazon store. 

Sales last 12m: £820k

Let some under-performing staff go recently as we're cutting costs and growing sales. 

Drop me a line if you know someone that might be interested
[9.01.24, 19:05:10] ~ L: Hey, guys! Is anyone here operating with a Hong Kong company? An accountant recommended that I open one, and I wanted to share this with you to see if someone has a similar business structure

[11.01.24, 10:43:13] ~ Tim Alleraun: For those running ads in Germany, how's performance for you guys?
[11.01.24, 10:58:41] ~ Mubasel: The last two days were a little worse than before, but its quite good, CPMs rising again but still low.
[11.01.24, 11:00:25] Bob: Yeah my profit % in Germany went down with 10%. Cpc is slightly higher but not much, it’s mys cvr which had gone down quite a lot.
[11.01.24, 11:10:12] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, 
we are having tons of customers everyday thats leaving negative reviews that we are not answering them on email. But when we search for them we cant find any emails from them.

Feels like something is not right. 
Have anyone experienced the same?
[11.01.24, 11:46:21] ~ Alex: Did you check your spam folder of your gmail linked to zendesk/Gorgias 

Had the same issue a few years back
[11.01.24, 12:20:29] Marek Olszewski: test deliverability from/to different email providers, check the inbox itself outside of zendesk, then zendesk. you’ll know where the problem is and how to address it
[11.01.24, 13:14:49] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Same here, went from average 36% to average 25% but its decreasing this month, last 3 days was not good. 

Cpc slightly higher, still fine, CTR on salespage is actually higher but CVR dropped a lot
[11.01.24, 13:14:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Could just be January
[11.01.24, 13:31:51] ~ David B: January can be a very tough month. Often people get paid early in December and then late in January. Some people have 40-50 days between paychecks which reduces their buying power.
[11.01.24, 13:38:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Makes sense
[11.01.24, 13:39:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Not worried or anything, other then CVR not much has changed so it will turn around again
[11.01.24, 13:45:12] ~ David B: Yes sir. I'm certain it will.
[11.01.24, 14:21:40] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, we will have our Creative Strategy/Content call again today. Did a little break over xmas/new years. It's in 1h40min (9AM EST). Can join then here: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87654957947

[11.01.24, 14:46:04] ~ Luka: Not Germany but we suddenly got a big drop in performance 3-4 days so far. January started amazing and suddenly a big drop in general. No significant change in CPMs
[11.01.24, 14:46:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah i had the same thing, started off great
[11.01.24, 14:46:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 3 days ago i actually got my first negative day lol
[11.01.24, 14:46:47] ~ Luka: What do you guys generally do when ROAS suddenly drops a lot for several days Do you tend to reduce budget a lot?
[11.01.24, 14:47:03] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i dont touch them but i dont run on much adspend now
[11.01.24, 14:47:31] ~ Bilel: Same here giant drop in CR and ROAS
[11.01.24, 14:47:50] ~ Bilel: 3-4 days ago as well
[11.01.24, 14:47:55] ~ Bilel: Gotta adapt!

[11.01.24, 14:48:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jep thats what im doing as well, just preparing a lot of content
[11.01.24, 14:52:10] ~ David B: It's a good time to push your socials and nurture your list. Remind them about your reviews and get them to look at testimonials.
[11.01.24, 15:08:08] ~ Lachy Waldon: Hey guys, who’s running their own google ads here? Is it as easy as facebook or worth outsourcing?
[11.01.24, 15:12:30] Marek Olszewski: it's harder, outsource and learn and then move it inhouse. YT ads are getting progressively easier to run though
[11.01.24, 15:19:46] ~ RS: Hey, anybody has HK PayPal insider? Our new HK PayPal account got disabled right after we submitted the first documents PayPal asked.

[11.01.24, 18:22:53] ~ Tim Alleraun: Thank you guys, will check that!
[11.01.24, 19:21:41] ~ Mubasel: I always look at the Klarna Paypal Ratio for germany, and at this moment a lot of people pay with Klarna, so that kinda proves that
[11.01.24, 19:33:14] ~ Kamal: I got the same price but I haven’t signed up yet. 

I’m using wetracked rn which is less than 1/3 the price and it’s working well, but hyros claims to be better so I’m curious to try it out
[11.01.24, 20:44:43] ~ Kyle Twohill: thats outrageous if thats monthly
[11.01.24, 21:01:29] ~ Ignasi: Yes. It’s crazy expensive
[11.01.24, 21:02:26] ~ Ignasi: The pricing is right. We use it. Not sure it’s the best bang for the buck though ‎<This message was edited>
[11.01.24, 21:03:31] ~ Ignasi: What’s everyone else using for multichannel attribution?
[11.01.24, 21:51:15] ~ Kamal: Did you find it directly improved Meta ROAS like they claim?

[12.01.24, 3:41:13] ~ Santi Roa: Yo guys quick question, what do you do about post purchase upselling when having multi-currency enabled? 
In our case it's only displaying the offers when the customer paid in USD. Any workarounds? We use Rebuy or Zipify
[12.01.24, 5:17:48] ~ Farhat Godil: Any insider contact to help my get my personal FB account back? Just got message in FB app that they suspended my account for not following community standards.
[12.01.24, 7:04:14] ~ Ignasi: It’s a Shopify limitation. You can’t edit orders in a currency different than the default one (which is what upsells do in the background). We now have a store for USD and EUR. What we did before that (and for still do for other currencies) is to have a post purchase discount (as a first time customer, get and extra 25% off. Code: XXXX valid for the next 10 minutes. ). This worked surprisingly well. We used AfterSell for that
[12.01.24, 11:27:20] ~ L: Hello everyone, is there any EU resident here who has their brand in the European market and would be willing to share some good insight about the business structure?

[12.01.24, 13:25:20] ~ Malik: You can do it with Unbounce, Clickfunnels, System io, and also have a dev code it for you bro

[12.01.24, 23:24:49] ~ Matteo S.R: I don’t like it, you have less opportunity to design as you want and you can t go as far as you want on Ecom with them compared to leads

Only used it for my agencies for easy and quick setup
[12.01.24, 23:25:27] ~ Matteo S.R: But not bad for a first setup for leads
[12.01.24, 23:25:58] ~ Matteo S.R: For as far as you want 
I mean complex Ecom funnel
[12.01.24, 23:25:59] ~ Dr Tim: Focus is on ecom not lead gen

If its not good for ecom then it's not good lol
[12.01.24, 23:26:30] ~ Dr Tim: Complex ecom funnel = Advertorial -> Product Page -> Checkout
[12.01.24, 23:27:07] ~ Matteo S.R: Yeah but I don’t know if you have another business related to leads ahah I wanted to give a complete review 😁

[13.01.24, 1:55:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I might have never heard someone do almost 50k on the second test day ‎<This message was edited>
[13.01.24, 1:55:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thats a first for me
[13.01.24, 1:55:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Congrats 🤝
[13.01.24, 2:13:29] Alex  Fedotoff: Well buy all the ad
Accounts in that bm 😂
[13.01.24, 2:31:07] ~ Allan L: Seems like The Dream. 
Old or new ad account/BM?

Those numbers are nearly unbelieveable. A roa that High on that scale, first time i hear about that in Ecom. And then on brand new store, you did something right! Thats for sure 🎯 ‎<This message was edited>
[13.01.24, 2:32:23] ~ Allan L: Remember The good Old crypto days where 18-20 roas with 0 cogs was possible. 😂
[13.01.24, 2:40:33] ~ Lachy Waldon: yeah 😂 my other brand is 18 months old and we turn over 10-15k/day consistently with a 2 roas and 20% margins and i was happy with that
[13.01.24, 3:31:48] Bob: Those are some crazy numbers! Great job! Is that with a custom product then as well or branded dropshipping?
[13.01.24, 10:11:33] ~ Allan L: Haha keep us posted about The new one

[13.01.24, 10:36:21] ~ Lachy Waldon: 60%💀
[13.01.24, 10:37:18] ~ Lachy Waldon: Cogs are only 25%
[13.01.24, 10:37:28] ~ Nicco: that's crazy, great job brother
[13.01.24, 10:37:48] ~ Lachy Waldon: And have run a blended roas of 9 over the last few days
[13.01.24, 10:37:51] ~ Nicco: how did you manage to scale the fb budget so quickly?
[13.01.24, 10:38:09] ~ Nicco: are you using bidcap or what
[13.01.24, 10:38:44] ~ Lachy Waldon: Just got to pray shopify payments and paypal stay strong
[13.01.24, 10:38:47] ~ Lachy Waldon: yeah bidcap
[13.01.24, 10:39:06] ~ Lachy Waldon: with 10k budgets and at 10 roas bidding value
[13.01.24, 10:39:18] ~ Lachy Waldon: most insane product i’ve ever restated
[13.01.24, 10:39:40] ~ Lachy Waldon: bit worried about scaling harder with payment providers and CNY
[13.01.24, 10:40:22] ~ G M: Amazing, are you using funnelish?
[13.01.24, 10:40:26] ~ Nicco: we all pray for you and your processors ahaha
[13.01.24, 10:40:58] ~ Allan L: At that scale it would be Quick to just pay a Shopify insider. 
Is this US only or?
[13.01.24, 10:41:02] ~ Nicco: nice, did you test your product directly in bidcap?
[13.01.24, 10:41:38] ~ Lachy Waldon: nah didn’t test with bid cap
[13.01.24, 10:41:49] ~ Lachy Waldon: tested normally and put the winners in an A+ bid cap
[13.01.24, 10:42:25] ~ Nicco: make sense, thanks for sharing
[13.01.24, 10:44:33] ~ Allan L: Like Can you see why The ROAs are so High? Good cpm, CTR or? I mean The aov seems to be around 140$ and a CR on 2.5%, Those are really good. But do you have an idea of why this is “happening”?
[13.01.24, 10:45:08] ~ Lachy Waldon: Yeah good CTR and low CPM and high AOV
[13.01.24, 10:45:15] ~ Lachy Waldon: CVR is shit
[13.01.24, 10:45:32] ~ Lachy Waldon: link click through rate is 3%+
[13.01.24, 10:45:43] ~ G M: Are you using long vsl as a creatives?
[13.01.24, 10:46:00] ~ Lachy Waldon: Cpm is $10 ish
[13.01.24, 10:46:07] ~ Lachy Waldon: or cost per link click is around 60c
[13.01.24, 10:46:28] ~ Lachy Waldon: Nah just tik tok style and we’ve created our own that appeal to the audience
[13.01.24, 10:46:52] ~ Allan L: Thats crazy. And this is in US? 10$ cpm
[13.01.24, 10:47:24] ~ G M: crazy, and just custom landing on shopify, or with funnelish?
[13.01.24, 11:03:13] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Would you say that running bid caps makes a good difference? Never done it.
[13.01.24, 11:11:03] ~ Maxi: Im curious aswell -
[13.01.24, 11:21:02] ~ Farhat Godil: A+ has bid cap now? I only saw cost cap till December
[13.01.24, 11:21:37] ~ Lachy Waldon: yeah cost per result goal sorry
[13.01.24, 11:21:50] ~ Lachy Waldon: just a shopify lander
[13.01.24, 11:23:20] ~ Farhat Godil: How are determining the cost per result bid?
[13.01.24, 11:27:17] ~ Maxi: I think it’s just 10x ROAS

If you sell something for 100 then your bid would be 10 USD for a purchase in theory I guess
[13.01.24, 11:28:20] ~ Farhat Godil: But whenever I have tried that my campaign doesn’t spend
[13.01.24, 11:32:01] ~ Luka: Try setting a bid, wait 2-3 days if no spend, increase it $2-3 until it spends
[13.01.24, 11:46:19] ~ Alessandro: @⁨~Lachy Waldon⁩ 
Great job bro! Happy for your results!
Your Shopify payments account was new?
It’s safe to scale so aggressively?

[15.01.24, 8:01:07] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Other countries are a bit expensive than china! India, Mexico, Columbia etc 

Better to stock inventory for a 1-2 weeks instead of tho
[15.01.24, 8:03:01] ~ Lachy Waldon: thanks @⁨~Bony Ghadiya⁩ what platforms are good for getting in contact with these countries?

[15.01.24, 11:52:23] ~ Santi Roa: If it's for this year, you're very late to test suppliers and stuff
[15.01.24, 11:53:05] ~ Santi Roa: For the next CNY, it's just easier to forecast inventory, but depending on your product you can look after Vietnam, India, Mexico, US, etc

You will find it easy to add people on your page

[16.01.24, 11:36:06] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: I tried using a service called "TruLease" that basically puts you on a lease in a physical location in the USA. With a utility bill and everything, but still got declined
[16.01.24, 12:22:36] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Right, so weird though as SP is Stripe basically 😂

[16.01.24, 14:26:31] ~ RS: Also, for other geo funnels I see that when customer tried to pay, it showed that card number is invalid. Then he tried a few more times and the card suddenly went through
[16.01.24, 14:39:39] ~ Y: This error means your funnel is not connected properly to the right payment gateway, a common mistake is to connect a gateway to a funnel and then editing or replacing that gateway when trying to connect it to a different funnel
[16.01.24, 14:40:02] ~ Y: Just reconnect the funnel to the gateway and test it in test mode and a vpn
[16.01.24, 14:40:16] ~ RS: But why the payment was successfull after 10 seconds when he refreshed the page?
[16.01.24, 14:40:35] ~ RS: I did nothing. Just watched Microsoft clarity live view
[16.01.24, 14:41:36] ~ Y: Was there no change at all? As payment method not found certainly means it was removed or similar, if you can send me more details can look into this for you
[16.01.24, 14:42:09] ~ RS: I sent your team many messages yesterday. Please check all of them if you can
[16.01.24, 14:43:36] ~ RS: Yep, I did not change anything, I just watched the live View and saw that the customer tried again and then the transaction went through
[16.01.24, 14:44:35] ~ RS: I DM’d you
[16.01.24, 17:09:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone who is living or planning to live in Dubai, do you know anything about Paypal UAE? With a offshore company they almost never will allow you unless you have a nominee there. Is it any good?
[16.01.24, 17:51:17] ~ Tim Alleraun: How do you guys deal with 1 and 2 star TrustPilot reviews? Our rating currently is 4.3 but dealing with those reviews would bump it up obviously. Any best practices to share with my VA?
[16.01.24, 17:51:49] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Are they genuine reviews? Or did those people never order and just hate on your trust pilot
[16.01.24, 17:52:22] ~ Tim Alleraun: To be honest, I don’t know. First step is probably to request more information, right?
[16.01.24, 17:53:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Yes but check it in your system if they even ordered (or let your VA check it). If they didnt order you can flag the review
[16.01.24, 17:53:05] ~ Jeremy Leppink: and trustpilot will remove it
[16.01.24, 17:54:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: If the review is honest and they have something to complain, most of the time replying on trustpilot giving them a good solution will let the customer change the review into a more positive review
[16.01.24, 17:54:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: might not be a 5, but a 3 looks better then a 1
[16.01.24, 17:55:22] ~ Tim Alleraun: Got it, thanks for sharing! In order to check to see if the customer ordered from us I need their email or full name (which we usually don’t have) - that’s probably when I have to request more info, right?
[16.01.24, 17:55:37] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah, indeed
[16.01.24, 17:55:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And i think by the way, if they dont provide the info within the time limit, the review gets removed automatically anyway
[16.01.24, 17:56:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Im not 100% sure though
[16.01.24, 17:57:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: This is how i got a score above 3 over a year ago when i was dropshipping fashion with a general store, not branded or anything.
[16.01.24, 18:00:49] ~ Tim Alleraun: Haha that would be awesome

[18.01.24, 17:46:38] ~ Mohammed-amine: Contacted Meta's support and theyr are saying that they'll need to send me Meta's bank account details, to send a manual wire, whole process would take a week, which is crazy

[19.01.24, 7:55:15] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys anyone know 

Know how to get a shopify payment us?

Currently mine is Swiss and I have huge costs because I sell abroad and can only collect in euros.

That comes to an average of 5.4% in fees.
[19.01.24, 8:53:38] ~ Faizan: Hey bro, we just recently switched over our Shopify payments from Ca to Us region. It was fairly simple. Just had to contact them and follow up on the matter frequently. They did need a US address & SSN. We just said we moved to the US, have an LLC & residence and would like to switch to US Shopify payments to save on currency conversion fee. They will then guide you to reset your Shopify payments account or manually do it and you can set it up again with the US info. 

First step was deactivate SP, then update the store address and details with your US info, then set up SP again, at which point it should prompt you to enter all details again. (Enter US info). If all is good it will activate and no issues, if they do need additional info they’ll reach out.
[19.01.24, 9:15:23] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thanks for your reply bro,
So just LLC is enough?
[19.01.24, 9:16:25] ~ Faizan: They need LLC & SSN, at times they can use the EIN instead of the SSN
[19.01.24, 9:19:06] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: For everyone selling in France, is PayPal and Stripe the most used payment methods?
[19.01.24, 10:23:37] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I think it also depends on who is assisting/reviewing you when you switch
[19.01.24, 10:24:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I switched multiple stores to SP UK, some got through fine and some got rejected because i dont have presence/residence in UK
[19.01.24, 10:24:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: This should be the same for US
[19.01.24, 10:37:42] ~ L: Yes
[19.01.24, 12:56:13] ~ L: Guys, are you experiencing issues with Stripe or PayPal in France? It's been two days with many ATCs and IC, but very few actual purchases (using a 3-page checkout on Shopify)
[19.01.24, 15:38:14] Matán Intsuper: I did it without SSN, just an ITIN
[19.01.24, 18:39:45] ~ Faizan: Yeah ITIN works too.
[19.01.24, 19:58:57] ~ Brett Fallarino: ‎This message was deleted.
[20.01.24, 1:09:27] ~ Faizan: Hey guys, just wondering are you using funnelish primarily for your PLPs or sticking to Shopify themes  or a page builder (pagefly). Asking since we want to use the check out features with funnelish and its post purchase upsells and downsells. We tired re-convert & loox upsells but for some reason it wasn’t showing to all customers. 

Goal is to increase AOV with a customized check out and post purchase upsells & downsells.
[20.01.24, 1:10:00] ~ Faizan: Any advice or help is welcomed ^ 🙏🏼
[20.01.24, 1:15:33] ~ RS: Hey! Is stripe and PayPal payment methods enough to sell to Mexico market? I heard that they prefered COD in the past but recently its totally ok with just card and PayPal payments. What are your thoughts?
[20.01.24, 1:20:50] ~ Kamal: We use a funnelish funnel on a subdomain for all paid traffic, and rest of site is built on gempages. 

Gives a more professional brand look and also allows you to increase CR and AOV a lot.
[20.01.24, 1:27:39] ~ Faizan: Thanks bro so all paid traffic uses the funnelish check out got that. 

As for the rest of the site, if a customer purchases do they end up using the Shopify checkout instead since funnelish is set up on a subdomain specially for paid traffic (the hero product)? ‎<This message was edited>
[20.01.24, 1:30:30] ~ Kamal: Yea but I have no navigation from funnel to shopify site. Shopify site is for brand recognition, organic search etc. Also looks good to payment processors. 

And yea some people buy through shopify but it's less than 10% of total so it's nbd.
[20.01.24, 2:00:43] ~ Faizan: Appreciate the insight brother
[20.01.24, 12:36:57] ~ Robin: Anyone that has a fb insider?

[20.01.24, 19:46:40] ~ RS: Is there anyone from funnelish that is Online now? Funnelish pay is not working for one of my funnels where traffic is going to currently. Funnelish pay page is Blank and I cannot add any payment method
[20.01.24, 20:01:47] ~ RS: @⁨~Y⁩ Please check your DM. Its urgent
‎[20.01.24, 22:15:49] ~ Dr Tim: ‎image omitted
[20.01.24, 22:17:04] ~ RS: The same for me. I send emails to these customers to place the order on my shopify store. Message funnelish owner with the details so he can come to a solution to fix this bug
[20.01.24, 22:17:49] ~ Dr Tim: This bug has been an issue for at least a month. They must know. I don't think me submitting to them will fix this issue
[20.01.24, 22:18:12] ~ Dr Tim: Is there any recommended alternative SaaS funnel for ESS beginners? ‎<This message was edited>

[21.01.24, 16:09:23] ~ Kamal: Hey guys any advice on expanding to Canada/UK markets from the US?

I’m selling only in US through funnelish and stripe/paypal. 

our 3PL is in the US so shipping international is going to cost me $10 more. 

should i price in CAD/GBP or is USD fine?  Shall i increase products price or just target a lower CPA?

Any tips would be appreciated. thanks!
[21.01.24, 16:45:01] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Sorry for late reply,
Okay thanks I will check

When testing products, do you use the same pixel as You've used for previous similiar products? (beauty niche and with 1500 purchases on it)

I recently started testing a new product thats very validated, just one store selling for more than 2-3m on monthly basis and alot of other competitioners. I pretty much 1 to 1 replicated the biggest competitioner on the market and ripped what they had.

However, after launching the ads I had really great metrics on facebook, but the buying metrics was litterly super awful. Like bot traffic (1% ATC, and 0.5% CR).

Could this be because of a already used pixel?

[22.01.24, 19:08:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: *Hey Guys!*

I would love helping one of you in your business with things such as *creative strategies, research, mediabuying, store management etc.*

As I just moved to Dubai, I have a huge amount of issues with processing and that got me thinking. I want something stable next to my business for peace of mind.

I have 4.5 years of E-Commerce experience, I know the ESS program pretty well and I am familiar with funnelish, VSLs, Shopify, Facebook ads, Notion, Slack and managing teams.

I will be available for *16-24 hours a week*,  and I am looking for a *long term relationship* to help you grow your business.

If you are interested and looking for someone who takes initiatives, wants a A player with great communication and is very eager to learn, I might be the guy you are looking for.

Please don’t hesitate to shoot me a *private message* and I would love to hop on a call!
[22.01.24, 21:02:22] ~ Eric R: Guys we are using Funnelish and when a customer purchases via Paypal, they don't receive an order receipt showing their order details - which is causing issues. How can we set it up so they receive an itemized order receipt when ordering via paypal?
[23.01.24, 11:04:46] Serhii Biletskyi: Hey! I vouch for this guy! If you need a creative strategist/funnel builder, he definitely can be a guy you're looking for. Had a lot of 1 on 1 calls with him

Half my transactions are failing on Stripe UK (hosted through funnelish).

I need help 🙏

[28.01.24, 1:46:09] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: @⁨~Mark⁩ Hey Mark, does WeTrack support Snapchat ads tracking?
[28.01.24, 1:46:37] ~ Mark: Yes we do!
[28.01.24, 10:30:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Why is my withdrawal limit just keeping to decrease on PayPal, so weird
[28.01.24, 10:31:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I have automatic tracking info setup, not getting many disputes at all
[28.01.24, 10:31:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Like now it already was bizarre low at 907, it just decreased to 277 lol
[28.01.24, 10:37:24] ~ Luka: Has anyone bought assets from another brand? Is it risky for your FB ad account?

I’m talking in terms of you having a brand in a non-competing country. Easy way to scale faster
[28.01.24, 11:52:59] ~ Daniel: hey guys, is anyone experiencing big fluctuations in sales on fb? We’ve been running very stable for over a year, but from Jan 10 it’s very shaky, and we’ve had some unprofitable days as well, it can be 2 ROAS 1 day, then the next day 1.4 ROAS with no changes, then back to 2 ROAS again, and I’m wondering if it’s common for January to be like that, or it’s just me
[28.01.24, 11:53:37] ~ RS: Yeah same for me. But past 3 days it very bad.
[28.01.24, 11:54:16] ~ Daniel: got it man, did you scale down?
[28.01.24, 11:56:04] ~ RS: Yeah. My main scaling campaigns died. Now big percent of budget goes to New campaigns and New tests so now its even more worse. But in my situation, my angle is dying slowly. Frequency is very high. For big4 countries frequency in the last 2 months is almost 3

[28.01.24, 17:27:36] ~ G M: Select Indonesia number it’s better
[28.01.24, 17:27:54] ~ G M: Then you can delete the number from Facebook, it’s not a problem
[28.01.24, 17:28:13] ~ G M: For US numbers sometimes give you some problems,
[28.01.24, 18:01:04] ~ Joshhlavati: ‎This message was deleted.
[29.01.24, 2:39:10] ~ lengjoo: omnisend just has a nicer user interface but I believe Klaviyo has a lot more features, everythingg you need
[29.01.24, 13:19:28] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Anyone have a great Facebook agency account 0% or little cash-back?
[29.01.24, 13:20:27] ~ Alex: Yeah ours has 0% and cash back
[29.01.24, 13:21:00] ~ L: Aurora offers 0% - only 300$ monthly fee
[29.01.24, 13:29:00] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Can you send me in Dm please?
[29.01.24, 13:29:12] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Seem correct
[29.01.24, 13:37:31] ~ Harout: we worked with Aurora they were terrible to say the least. Not recommended at all
[29.01.24, 13:38:41] ~ L: I've worked with them and everything went fine, can't say I don't recommend them
[29.01.24, 14:37:42] Bob: Do you guys have any tips for any programs/softwares for all content that we have.

Atm we have everything in Dropbox folders, but there are video's in there that are like a minute and several parts could be used by our editors, but then they have to watch the entire video and basically already know all videos from the dropbox folder.

Does anyone know if there is anything where we could better organise everything and have like tags for every video?
[29.01.24, 14:38:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: im not sure but you might be able to use Motion for that?
[29.01.24, 14:38:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Maybe its only for analyzing though, not sure
[29.01.24, 14:39:41] Ori: Air/frame.io
[29.01.24, 14:51:18] ~ Franco: Anyone have any tips running ads with before and after images inside the vid? We’re in beauty and our ads with before and after won’t get approved. Some of our competitions are running the same style, one even has the text before & after in it. Any advice would be helpful thanks. ‎<This message was edited>

[29.01.24, 18:57:59] Bob: Yeah thanks for sharing that! I also checked them out and I thought there maybe would be ways this could be cheaper, and because we don’t have anything in English we would still have to organize everything ourselves. 

But this seems like one of the best options!
[29.01.24, 22:12:34] ~ lengjoo: yea we did, going to test out and see how it does for our team

[30.01.24, 13:48:36] ~ Alessandro Sassi: zeroco.com.au Au based but it has pretty cool branding

[31.01.24, 7:37:43] ~ Luka: Anyone know what might be causing 3x higher CPMs on our new product?
We launched a new product 2 days ago on our established brand/ad account and our ads for it are are seeing crazy high CPMs, very high for our country. 

Our main product is a specific pain-point product and seeing much lower CPMs. The new product is a more general product and should actually be seeing cheaper CPMs than our main product, but it's 3x more expensive.

Tried to make our ad-copy more friendly but that didn't solve it. This issue persists for all angles and also creative types: images, videos, short vid, & long
[31.01.24, 10:32:58] ~ Mikael: My personal amex just told me I have to stop paying for ads for my company.

Are there any other great solutions for this?
[31.01.24, 10:33:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: A business Amex :D
[31.01.24, 10:33:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i had the same thing
[31.01.24, 10:33:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: used my personal one for 2 years no problem, but then they called and mailed me i had to stop
[31.01.24, 10:34:05] Bob: Where you able to get a business Amex then?
[31.01.24, 10:34:14] ~ Mikael: Amex doesnt have business card in sweden.. lol
[31.01.24, 10:34:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: oh lol
[31.01.24, 10:38:29] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: According to my accountant its against "skatteverket" to have a personal card and use it to pay of business expenses. Maybe thats why they are putting it down. Since its technically abusing the system for your gain.
[31.01.24, 10:45:09] Bob: Yeah it is. But you basically lend money privately to the company when paying with your amex and then you pay yourself back. That actually is okay to do, I guess it's just not okay to have this happening for the same expense all the time
[31.01.24, 10:52:08] ~ Alex: Was anyone able to get a business Amex after setting up a USA entity remotely?

Can’t get Amex or any decent cc in Ireland, I’v missed out on so many points over the years
[31.01.24, 12:00:35] ~ LA: apply for an ITIN remotely or through an agent from $150 and in 2-3 months you can begin the credit building journey
[31.01.24, 12:01:34] ~ Luka: After getting an ITIN do you simply just apply for AMEX and easy to get approved? And you gotta use a secured card for 6-12 months first?
[31.01.24, 12:06:11] ~ Harout: has anyone effectively outsourced payroll? you simply trust your employee with the bank accounts or do you have a software/system in place?
[31.01.24, 12:11:47] ~ Nim: more importantly, personal Amex has net terms, business Amex is a charge card which needs to be paid off in full every 30 days ... so need to think a bit more about cashflow
[31.01.24, 12:12:31] ~ Nim: trick is to have multiple different Amex personal cards ... and use for business, cycle through them ... have net terms on all of them
[31.01.24, 12:13:21] ~ Nim: then get net terms on fb ads account, then you have a better cashflow cycle
[31.01.24, 12:43:55] ~ Santi Roa: It's not that simple. If you are already an Amex user and have history with Amex, maybe they will accept you. 

In my case, I have ITIN, over 15m in rev, a lot of spent and history with ny company, but still they couldn't verify my personal credit history so they didn't approve my account
[31.01.24, 12:46:10] ~ LA: You will still need a verifiable US address, and a decent credit score.
[31.01.24, 12:53:58] ~ Mikael: Yesh. I think matrix is on us 😂
[31.01.24, 13:40:17] ~ Tim Alleraun: Bro thank you 🙏🏼

[31.01.24, 22:25:09] ~ David B: Understood. In my experience it depends on the sales volume and the price point of the item as to whether its a cost effective strategy for retrieving sales.

[1.02.24, 17:43:07] ~ Kevin kreative: @⁨~Thomas Tran⁩ have dispute fix serv
[1.02.24, 17:43:19] ~ RS: Have you implemented ethoca, RDR, cdrn alerts?
[1.02.24, 17:43:29] Matán Intsuper: i'm looking to reduce the dispute rate, not solve them
[1.02.24, 17:43:35] ~ RS: My dispute rate went down 80-90%
[1.02.24, 17:43:36] ~ Kevin kreative: but you still need to ramp up CS service
[1.02.24, 17:43:39] Matán Intsuper: i dont know any of those words you just mentioned
[1.02.24, 17:44:00] ~ RS: Just get shopify app Chargeflow
[1.02.24, 17:44:11] ~ RS: You will understand everything
[1.02.24, 17:44:12] ~ L: me neither but I'm interested, what do those words mean
[1.02.24, 17:44:19] Matán Intsuper: you guys aren't understanding what i'm saying
[1.02.24, 17:44:32] Matán Intsuper: dispute rate is the amount of disputes out of amount of transactions. if you have 1 dispute out of 100 disputes, thats 1% dispute rate.
[1.02.24, 17:44:41] ~ RS: 😀
[1.02.24, 17:44:42] Matán Intsuper: i dont care if i win or lose them
[1.02.24, 17:44:56] ~ RS: I perfectly understand you
[1.02.24, 17:45:01] ~ RS: Chargeflow
[1.02.24, 17:45:14] Matán Intsuper: chargeflow doesnt prevent disputes, it only answers them, and they lost all of them
[1.02.24, 17:45:19] Matán Intsuper: i've used them for 3 months
[1.02.24, 17:45:23] ~ RS: They will alert you for upcoming disputes, and will refund these disputed before chargeback is initiated
[1.02.24, 17:45:40] Matán Intsuper: i am getting stripe alerts to my mail before there's a dispute and i refund them myself. its not the solution
[1.02.24, 17:45:57] Matán Intsuper: the solution is a service that makes a lot of transactions to your stripe that are not disputed later. i'm looking for such service. @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ had a contact in the past
[1.02.24, 17:45:58] ~ RS: Stripe send you alerts when reason is “fraudulent”
[1.02.24, 17:47:28] ~ RS: Yeah in the course there was Contact of some agency that makes thousands of transactions . I think it was under payments course
[1.02.24, 17:48:02] Matán Intsuper: i've used chargeflow, it didnt help. my cx is 100%, the disputes are done due to technical problem in the market im selling to
[1.02.24, 17:48:42] Matán Intsuper: most of the disputes we speak with the customers and they say that they disputed another transaction and the credit card company canceled all the international transactions for them.
[1.02.24, 17:48:57] Matán Intsuper: and they still want the product and some of them pay for it again
[1.02.24, 17:49:22] Matán Intsuper: so the only way to solve it as i see  is this
[1.02.24, 17:50:44] ~ L: What country is it?
[1.02.24, 17:52:20] ~ Thomas Tran: HI man, its Dispute Fix services, basically we put transaction into your payment processor to reduce your dispute rate. Will DM you for more information

[1.02.24, 17:53:54] ~ Thomas Tran: sure man, no problem
[1.02.24, 18:43:47] ~ Zain Ahmed: How do you guys test advertorials?

I can pick a winning one off which has the highest EPC, but our facebook ROAS has tanked and I don’t know if it’s the creative, ad market, or advertorial.

Do you test it with some sort of control?
[1.02.24, 18:59:33] ~ Santiago: I test with simple ad images and ad copy, so i know if that shit converts then is due to the advertorial
[1.02.24, 20:43:43] ~ Tarlan: Do you have to keep all company information same for Klarna merchant after approval?
[1.02.24, 20:47:22] ~ Alessandro Sassi: You could create a separate FB campaign just to test advertorials. Spend split between 2 adsets, 1 ad each. One redirecting to the sales page and one to the advertorial. So you can track the Roas on the ads manager, even if it is not super accurate

[2.02.24, 0:09:30] ~ Kyle Twohill: in funnelish do you guys use a custom domain for every country or just the geofunnels feature
[2.02.24, 0:09:55] ~ Kyle Twohill: I assume new funnel with .de .fr ending etc is better right?
[2.02.24, 3:09:11] ~ Tarlan: I use same domain + /de /fr
[2.02.24, 3:09:57] ~ Tarlan: if it’s same language, just different currencies for different countries, then Geofunnels with same domain and pathes
[2.02.24, 8:39:00] ~ Mikael: Do anyone have a clear explanation to the Dmarc shit. I just want to make it clear that Ive done it right..
TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:support@Mybrand.com;

This is what i set in and also the dmarc checker says its correct?
[2.02.24, 9:02:15] ~ Tiberio: I think it’s correct, i’ve set it yesterday exactly like this but without “rua…”
[2.02.24, 9:08:35] ~ Mikael: some ppl say without rua. some ppl say with rua. thats why its confusing hehe..

[2.02.24, 10:15:10] ~ Tiberio: Yeah I guess you can always add it later
[2.02.24, 11:40:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone tried making a AI video voice over with Heygen in healthniche?

[2.02.24, 17:14:07] ~ L: Ehy guys anyone here is running a quiz funnel with shopify?
[2.02.24, 18:04:08] Radek: My piece of advise would be to split test the price. 

I know it doesn’t sound like directly related to the CPMs, but if you run conversion campaign and your pricing is more expensive than realistically perceived value, fb need to target specific (premium segment) people in order to get that conversion, which effectively narrows down the pool of buyers and thus higher CPM. 

It’s just my hypothesis but this experiment helped my brand to get down even to $10CPM in US and overall better funnel metrics.
[2.02.24, 18:27:50] ~ Eric R: Great point about split testing pricing. How much lower did you drop the price to see these better results?
[2.02.24, 18:33:20] ~ David B: Also consider split testing the price higher. 

Higher price higher perceived quality. 

Several brands I've worked with have seen an increase in sales when they have raised their price. 

One brand increased by over $30 per unit and the higher the price the more they sold. ‎<This message was edited>
[2.02.24, 18:54:33] ~ Kamal: Damn definitely need to try that
[2.02.24, 18:55:14] ~ Kamal: What do you guys think of charging shipping vs free shipping? i charge $10 shipping and handling on a $40 product. should we raise the price and have free shipping?
[2.02.24, 18:56:08] Radek: For us it was 20% drop, but I am sure it is very specific to the niche, product uniqueness and other factors that influence the perceived value.

I am responding on how to lower the CPM, but not saying this is the correct way. 

Because CPMs are just part of the funnel equation, you might be much more profitable with higher CPMs and higher margins, it’s just worth considering.
[2.02.24, 18:58:11] ~ David B: You should fold in the shipping cost if you can. 

Free shipping will boost conversion even if you raise the prices to compensate. 

There is a good article on it here.

[4.02.24, 6:14:33] ~ Mohammed-amine: What tool do you recommend for splitting traffic between URLs?

For CRO split testing

l used to use Google optimize, but it no longer exists

And the classic CRO tools are crazy expensive with features I don't need 

All I want is the ability to split traffic between 2 URLS
[4.02.24, 13:28:49] ~ Ignasi: I used this for a while. It’s pretty cool feature-wise. The redirection is a bit slower than others. You can redirect by geo, even cloak, track conversions etc

https://linklyhq.com/#linkly-features
[4.02.24, 13:30:46] ~ Ignasi: Their A/B feature is called link rotator: https://linklyhq.com/support/link-rotator
[4.02.24, 14:25:21] ~ Sonu Duhra: I use Intelligems. You can do all kind of tests, including URL splits.
[4.02.24, 16:47:02] ~ Mohammed-amine: will check this thanks
[4.02.24, 16:47:11] ~ Mohammed-amine: looks interesting will take a look

[4.02.24, 17:53:14] ~ Marin: For those of you that already bought tickets and will be attending, hit me up once there and let’s meet in person
[4.02.24, 18:16:45] ~ Ecomcesar: Does anyone have a good contact to make VSLs?
[5.02.24, 9:13:20] ~ Sonu Duhra: What you guys think of 3PL vs In-house fulfilment?
[5.02.24, 10:43:55] ~ Santi Roa: How big is your brand?
[5.02.24, 10:45:43] ~ Santi Roa: I'd go 3PL in most cases no matter the size unless it creates a unique advantage. 

Having inhouse fulfillment can be a risk and a distraction for you.
[5.02.24, 11:23:35] ~ Sonu Duhra: Right now we do it ourselves with pick and pack costs of 0,20 cent. But yes it’s a big distraction, printing out those labels everyday and taking care of returns
[5.02.24, 11:25:51] ~ Santi Roa: Even if 3pl would costs you 1.5usd pick and pack... ($1.3 difference per order)

I bet you could decrease CPA, or somehow increase your margins 1.3usd per order by spending that time and energy in the stuff that matters
[5.02.24, 11:26:00] ~ Santi Roa: The main thing is keeping the main thing the main thing
[5.02.24, 11:54:19] ~ Sonu Duhra: That’s huge man thanks
[5.02.24, 11:54:51] ~ Sonu Duhra: But then why people do in-House fulfilment? @⁨~Ignasi⁩
[5.02.24, 11:56:54] ~ Santi Roa: Sometimes it can be a unique advantage for your company, sometimes you can't delegate that huge part of the biz to a bunch of different 3pls

Imagine if you do 10.000 orders per day... your logistics then become REALLY strategic. You can not improve and make a difference if you don't control it
[5.02.24, 11:57:22] ~ Santi Roa: I experienced that recently
[5.02.24, 11:57:36] ~ Santi Roa: Growing from 300k/800k a month to over 2.5m/month
[5.02.24, 11:58:30] ~ Santi Roa: Small issues scale fast, and if you don't control them, it's super hard to improve and solve problems. Mostly when these things take time and involve physical flows of things.

It takes a few months to move all SKU, products, and channels to another 3pl
[5.02.24, 11:59:46] ~ Santi Roa: I'm seeing something like that now with international sales, Amazon, trying to get to retail distribution, growing skus, needing personalization and more custom shit 3pls don't do (for example analyzing defective returns and provide a report for my product design team)
[5.02.24, 12:02:24] ~ Santi Roa: After you get some scale, flexibility decreases and everything takes months to plan.

Another example: a rebranding

Before, I thought it was just coming up with a new logo and colors for the brand... now it evolved into doing a professional customer research (not DIY), working on the brand persona, voice, etc. Then after finding and having the right logo and colors, redesign all packaging and manufacture that.

Manufacturing takes 45days + 30days sea freight to the US.

But I also need to handle inventory leftouts with old branding
[5.02.24, 12:03:29] ~ Santi Roa: So everything becomes more complex as you scale, and that's when you might consider bringing those things that are not core to your biz now, inhouse, for strategic reasons.

But don't do it to be cheap and save a few bucks (I made that mistake having everything inhouse then nothing had my attention)
[5.02.24, 12:04:08] ~ Santi Roa: I hope this gives perspective, and I wish I heard this a year ago.
It's not the final truth, is hust what I experienced so far.
[5.02.24, 12:05:49] ~ Santi Roa: Btw, 
Don't confuse this with "yeah let's go find 3pls and delegate everything now" maybe at this point is right for you to fulfill and save that money, learn about fulfillment, and build momentum.
[5.02.24, 12:21:12] ~ Ignasi: If you can, avoid doing it in-house  — it’s complex and distracting. We chose to do it because it was a lot cheaper at the time. When we started scaling we outsourced part of it. So we keep our internal fulfillment at 100% capacity and then the overflow goes to an external partner. For reference our fulfillment cost per order is about $0.30 but it’s a lot of work
[5.02.24, 12:25:48] ~ Sonu Duhra: Thank you.
[5.02.24, 12:35:35] ~ Sonu Duhra: We have been doing this for 2 years. Our brand is not stable, we have high and lows a lot. From 15k orders per month to 5k orders. I just want to focus more on the business and optimising it and also looking for other opportunities rather to take care of fulfilment
[5.02.24, 12:49:30] ~ Sonu Duhra: What are the pick and pack costs of the 3PL you use? And do they have good shipping prices to Europe countries?
[5.02.24, 13:14:16] ~ Sonu Duhra: Can you recommend me a good 3PL that ships to whole Europe and has good prices?

[5.02.24, 23:10:25] ~ Zain Ahmed: what do you guys use for swiping on facebook? I'm using vidtao for YT and am looking for something like this for facebook.

I've used adspy (doesn't have a good search) and I've used foreplay (doesn't have any way of checking performance of ads)
[5.02.24, 23:17:29] ~ Malik: Hey guys, I have a second store that is 100% dropshipping and doing great numbers. I didn't buy stock for this one. Is there a way to still send the orders during CNY ? CJ dropshipping they still work ? or an other company/website maybe ? If you have any info that'd be super nice
[5.02.24, 23:17:31] ~ Malik: thank you
[5.02.24, 23:18:02] Matán Intsuper: Nobody in china works during new years. Ask your supplier for the dates he’s off and prepare for that
[5.02.24, 23:18:51] ~ Malik: I see thx - Is there maybe any US based dropshipping center with inventory ?
[6.02.24, 0:47:46] ~ Omid: Since your saying it’s dropshipping, You can try zendrop or Usadrop to see if they have your product on hand and if so you should be good. There are more options but those are the guys that have USA stock I know for sure ‎<This message was edited>
[6.02.24, 0:48:40] ~ Malik: Thx a lot - I sell in Europe but I'll reach out to them
[6.02.24, 0:52:39] ~ Omid: Just to add, If you want to get really specific do what Matan said but  message all the suppliers who sell it and ask when they will be ready, as some come back earlier and some com back later so you can find soonest option
[6.02.24, 1:11:41] ~ Malik: Yeah exactly. As soon as I find a supplier, my agent can handle everything as he's doing with my brand
[6.02.24, 2:40:14] ~ Ecomcesar: Hello!! Quick question is there a tool in funnelish or that works with funnelish to clone landing pages as you can do with checkout champs ?

[8.02.24, 15:29:07] ~ Kamal: Have been using wistia for a while, started testing vidalytics recently. they advertise a higher conversion rate but so far in my tests they seem about even
[8.02.24, 15:29:40] ~ Kamal: My problem with wistia is once you’re past 1 tb bandwidth per month they want you to sign a yearly contract

[8.02.24, 15:46:49] ~ Kamal: Vidalytics is just as expensive but you don’t have to sign a yearly contract at least

[9.02.24, 9:30:50] ~ Ignasi: I’ve recently launched a higher priced product (3x my usual AOV), It’s doing well at a higher CPA but now the other campaigns seem to be optimizing also for such a high CPA and they’re going to shit. 

Has anyone experienced a similar problem and how have you solved it? How do you structure things in such a scenario?

In the past I’ve solved it using bidcaps and/or custom conversions, but it’s been a while and before I restructure the whole account I’d love to hear from you guys
[9.02.24, 9:31:11] ~ Ignasi: (US Market)
[9.02.24, 11:30:31] ~ Santi Roa: Are you using same ad account?
[9.02.24, 11:30:51] ~ Santi Roa: We always used a new ad account for a new product if it's not very very similar
[9.02.24, 11:33:40] ~ Ignasi: In this case yes. Same pixel or diff pixel? Same site or specific for the product ?
[9.02.24, 11:35:36] ~ Santi Roa: That could be the case. Meta optimizes per ad account
[9.02.24, 11:35:48] ~ Santi Roa: I used same pixel, different ad accounts. Same website

[9.02.24, 21:53:00] ~ Maxi: We had same issues
[9.02.24, 21:53:10] ~ Maxi: I started to switch out ads left and right 😂

[9.02.24, 23:16:42] ~ Tarlan: does anyone know how to get UK proof of address as a foreigner who does not live in UK?

That’s the only missing document to get approved for UK Klarna merchant :D

I have UK company and bank account, but they do not accept bank statement as a proof of address. So have to find an other solution.
[9.02.24, 23:35:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I think if you search on Google you can actually find solutions for this, i think you can even buy those documents
[9.02.24, 23:37:15] ~ Tarlan: I searched for an hour but could not find exact answer. 

I saw some of the websites who provides fake document, but none of them have good reviews, so not sure if it’s the best choice 😀
[9.02.24, 23:42:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You can also fake it
[9.02.24, 23:42:49] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Pdf to word converter, change text, word to pdf

[10.02.24, 9:10:11] ~ Maxi: What about the live funnels, will it affect the sales ?
[10.02.24, 9:11:34] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: @⁨~Y⁩
[10.02.24, 10:09:34] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I cant even get into funnelish
[10.02.24, 10:09:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: it logged me out and now it just gives a error message
[10.02.24, 10:46:14] ~ Harvey: @⁨~Y⁩ you guys need to alert people when Funnelish is down - this is the third time this week
[10.02.24, 10:46:33] ~ Maxi: This some serious issue man @⁨~Y⁩
[10.02.24, 11:09:23] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Yes send me a message in DM
[10.02.24, 11:17:35] ~ RS: But can your customers access your funnel if funnelish is down?
[10.02.24, 11:18:34] ~ Maxi: No
[10.02.24, 11:18:51] ~ Maxi: Last order & optin 4-5h ago
[10.02.24, 11:19:12] ~ RS: Oh. My last order was 3h ago. But when I tried to access my funnel, it was Ok.
[10.02.24, 11:23:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: funnelish works for me again
[10.02.24, 11:23:57] ~ Nicco: Do you recommend deactivating all campaigns? Or could they lose optimisation?
[10.02.24, 11:39:13] ~ Y: Purchases, automations and all essential services are working fine. And weren’t impacted by the issue, it seems to have been a lag affecting our dashboard which has been resolved
[10.02.24, 11:40:17] ~ Maxi: I don’t think that’s true.

I just talked to about 4 people and all have seen the same purchase fluctuation.

The exact same.

This was definetly affecting purchases
[10.02.24, 11:40:19] ~ Y: The issue didn’t affect live funnels, sales or automations, only the dashboard was affected
[10.02.24, 11:42:03] ~ Harvey: Yes they were
[10.02.24, 11:42:21] ~ Harvey: All wetracked automations stopped
[10.02.24, 11:42:27] ~ Harvey: All orders and options stopped
[10.02.24, 11:42:34] ~ Harvey: At the same time for everyone
[10.02.24, 11:43:34] ~ Y: Globally I don’t see any impact at all, the lag occurred during the off peak time, 5-9am, there were there few reboots at the time, which might have caused brief downtimes ~2mins
[10.02.24, 11:44:23] ~ Maxi: The downtimes were definetly more than 2 mins.

More like 5-7h

Across multiple days this week
[10.02.24, 11:45:17] ~ Y: The sales, optins would still occur but there will be a delay in them being shown in the dashboard, if that wasn’t the case please message me any details and i will have a look
[10.02.24, 11:46:24] ~ Maxi: If there were sales they would be tracked in Shopify via sync.

Since you said sync works but obviously there were no sales in funnelish and no sales synced
[10.02.24, 11:47:34] ~ Y: Strange I don’t see any drop in volumes being processed at all, and none of our systems detected any issues! If you are still seeing that issue pls send me the checkout page url
[10.02.24, 11:48:10] ~ Harvey: @⁨~Y⁩ if multiple people here are telling you otherwise then you must be wrong…
[10.02.24, 11:48:16] ~ Harvey: It’s not a coincidence
[10.02.24, 11:48:37] ~ RS: Harvey, did you have a sales drop as well today?
[10.02.24, 11:48:37] ~ Maxi: Exactly, literally more than 5 people messaged me all at the same time come on …
[10.02.24, 11:50:09] ~ Y: Yesterday’s downtime did impact sales indeed, this morning didn’t! But I would appreciate it if you guys can provide some details to be able to check further
[10.02.24, 11:52:54] ~ Maxi: It would be good to just notify here always as soon as even a little thing is being changed in funnelish or any downtime is happening 

It looks like every minor change in funnelish will affect sales even if you think it won’t
[10.02.24, 11:57:51] ~ Y: i think that would be a good idea, will make sure there is an announcement in similar cases, and hopefully they won't occur again!
[10.02.24, 11:58:10] ~ Maxi: Thanks a lot 👍🏻
[10.02.24, 12:07:25] ~ Harvey: Yep no optins or sales for like 5 hours
[10.02.24, 12:07:40] ~ RS: Omg
[10.02.24, 12:12:02] ~ Nicco: same here
[10.02.24, 12:12:25] ~ Nicco: and it's not the first time this week
[10.02.24, 12:12:34] ~ Nicco: not even the second
[10.02.24, 12:50:19] ~ lengjoo: on our end, past 5 hours definitely smth was off, things picking up again, are things back to normal now?
[10.02.24, 14:21:43] ~ Jordan: Jordan from wetracked.io here. We've noticed that Funnelish did not send us anything through automation between 04:30am and 10:00am CET for some stores. ‎<This message was edited>
[10.02.24, 14:25:59] ~ RS: …
[10.02.24, 14:37:16] ~ Jordan: So @⁨~Y⁩, perhaps you could investigate what happened during that time frame.
[10.02.24, 14:48:20] ~ Maxi: Has funnelish stabalised for everyone ?
[10.02.24, 14:49:54] ~ Harvey: 2 conversions in 3 hours 😂 could just be Facebook unoptimised due to no conversions for like 5 hours tho
[10.02.24, 14:50:54] ~ Harvey: You?
[10.02.24, 14:54:18] ~ lengjoo: still looking rough for us
[10.02.24, 15:00:40] ~ Maxi: Man I don’t think so
[10.02.24, 15:00:48] ~ Maxi: That must be a funnelish issue
[10.02.24, 15:01:03] ~ Maxi: I even relaunch my top campaigns
[11.02.24, 20:41:42] ~ Mohammed-amine: Hey guys
[11.02.24, 20:41:50] ~ Mohammed-amine: for those of you selling in multiple countries
[11.02.24, 20:42:08] ~ Mohammed-amine: do you create a separate Shopify store for each country?
[11.02.24, 21:14:51] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Would you guys say that running ads on an Agency account vs a personal account generate different results?
[11.02.24, 21:15:22] ~ Robert Gonzalez: No, but you risk your account of being banned
[11.02.24, 21:55:26] ~ Ignasi: Not in our case
[11.02.24, 22:14:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I did before but now i just have 1 store
[11.02.24, 22:14:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Any of you guys know a app that does the same as translate & adapt? As they only have 2 languages as the Max
[11.02.24, 22:24:41] ~ P: Weglot
[11.02.24, 22:37:00] ~ Ignasi: We use Weglot for landings. Totally recommended
[11.02.24, 22:43:47] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Perfect, thanks 🙌🤝
[11.02.24, 23:30:34] ~ Kyle Twohill: Transcy app
[11.02.24, 23:31:26] ~ Kyle Twohill: You can do 20 languages
[12.02.24, 1:45:42] ~ Luke Voigt: How’s everyone’s February looking like (volume wise)? And Q1 in general?
[12.02.24, 11:02:49] ~ Sonu Duhra: We use Weglot for our website. I think it also depends where you ship from and if you use a 3PL.
[12.02.24, 11:20:27] ~ Luka: Anyone know of some female fashion brands that crush it on FB/IG/TikTok?
[12.02.24, 13:02:07] ~ Jocke: Which is the best Email Autoresponder in your opinion?
[12.02.24, 13:44:11] ~ L: Ehy guys anyone is experiencing higher CPM in UK? (more than doubled) in the past 48 hrs
[12.02.24, 13:45:06] ~ Marko: Is it true that US based companies cannot advertise on TikTok in europe? Curious if this means there’s less competetion in the EU market on TikTok
[12.02.24, 13:46:07] ~ Marko: Also, anyone crushing it with TikTok ads in native language in the European market?
[12.02.24, 13:50:10] ~ Sonu Duhra: no
[12.02.24, 13:50:28] ~ Kevin Krieg: You can, just not by opening your own Business Center under your US company data. Tiktok makes countries available to target based on where your company is based. Check here: https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/placements-available-locations
[12.02.24, 13:50:29] ~ L: Thank you
[12.02.24, 13:50:54] ~ Kevin Krieg: You can use agency accounts or a different company data though to advertise in EU with US company
[12.02.24, 13:52:00] ~ Kevin Krieg: We only run in native language in EU on tt, works well. Works better than english language, but can work too depending on the country. Scandinavian countries work well with english too cause their english is great
[12.02.24, 14:53:00] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys does anyone have residency or a company in Cyprus?
[12.02.24, 15:47:48] ~ Harout: yup feel free to reach out
[12.02.24, 15:56:39] ~ Ignasi: Guys - what’s your go to spy-tool for ads with accurate / real conversion data?
[12.02.24, 16:46:55] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For the guys who run in france with Funnelish. Do you call your Credit/debit card payment just Cartes Bancaires? I know you can turn that on in Stripe but isnt it just the same as enabling creditcards in general?
[12.02.24, 17:27:39] ~ Mike Ramsey: Carte Bancaire (CB) functions as the French national scheme for card payments. It’s interoperable with major international card networks like Visa and MasterCard, meaning that Carte Bancaire cards are often co-branded with these international networks, allowing them to be used not just domestically but also internationally

[12.02.24, 19:27:47] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: If you're talking about what to show the customer, Funnelish is the place to edit.
[12.02.24, 19:54:48] ~ Eric R: Hey guys, when connecting Shopify to Funnelish, do you typically turn this "Enable Bundling" option on?
‎[12.02.24, 19:54:55] ~ Eric R: ‎image omitted
[12.02.24, 19:55:36] ~ RS: Yes, Otherwise order bumps and upsells will get created in shopify as seperate orders
[12.02.24, 21:10:29] ~ RS: How is your sales in funnelish last hours?
[12.02.24, 21:27:32] ~ Maxi: Not good
[12.02.24, 21:27:47] ~ Maxi: Im moving everything to checkout champ
[12.02.24, 22:26:34] ~ Ecomcesar: Hello
[12.02.24, 22:27:12] ~ Ecomcesar: Guys is there any way to track the funnelish purchases in facebook as unique purchases ?
[12.02.24, 22:27:44] ~ Ecomcesar: And avoid upsells and downsells to track as anotjer purchase ?
[12.02.24, 22:28:21] ~ Ecomcesar: Any solution ?
[12.02.24, 22:28:51] ~ RS: Wetracked.io
[12.02.24, 22:29:09] ~ RS: Im using them
[12.02.24, 22:29:20] ~ Ecomcesar: Have installed but still track upsells and downsells as a new purchase
[12.02.24, 22:29:35] ~ Ecomcesar: Have you done it wetrack?
[12.02.24, 22:30:10] ~ Nim: you need to bundle them so it appears as one order
[12.02.24, 22:30:24] ~ Nim: then wetracked will track it as one transaction, if that is what you are asking
[12.02.24, 22:30:33] ~ Ecomcesar: But in that case i cant offer upsells and downsells?
[12.02.24, 22:31:06] ~ Nim: yes you can but on the checkout page you need to put a timer
[12.02.24, 22:31:30] ~ Nim: so it waits X minutes until customer has flowed through entire funnel
[12.02.24, 22:32:01] ~ Ecomcesar: Yes i have and all orders are going to shopify as a unique order
[12.02.24, 22:32:12] ~ Ecomcesar: But on we track it tracks as separate orders
[12.02.24, 22:32:27] ~ Ecomcesar: Also if I use the native funnelish facebook pixel integration
[12.02.24, 22:32:36] ~ Ecomcesar: And it's very hard to optimize my campaigns
[12.02.24, 22:33:16] ~ Ecomcesar: If can be donde would really appreciate an explanation 🙏🙏🙂💪
[12.02.24, 22:33:57] ~ Ecomcesar: As I am getting lot of upsells and downsells but they are all being registered as new purchase and I can't optimize my campaigns properly
[12.02.24, 22:34:45] ~ Ecomcesar: Any advise will be more that helpful
‎[12.02.24, 22:35:23] ~ Nim: ‎image omitted
[12.02.24, 22:35:36] ~ Nim: because that is what makes it seen as a single transaction
[12.02.24, 22:36:03] ~ Ecomcesar: Yes I have and all orders are being group in shopify as a single order
[12.02.24, 22:36:10] ~ Ecomcesar: But not in the pixel event
[12.02.24, 22:36:17] ~ Ecomcesar: That are being track separately
[12.02.24, 22:36:23] ~ Nim: I see .. that's weird af man
[12.02.24, 22:37:13] ~ Ecomcesar: It should be tracking as a single purchase  in wettracked ?
[12.02.24, 22:38:24] ~ Nim: yes, correct
[12.02.24, 22:38:50] ~ Nim: as it appears in shopify, it should show as a single purchase event in wetracked
[12.02.24, 22:39:03] ~ Nim: i.e. the final 'bundled' event
[12.02.24, 22:40:42] ~ Ecomcesar: look
‎[12.02.24, 22:40:43] ~ Ecomcesar: ‎image omitted
[12.02.24, 22:41:25] ~ Ecomcesar: facebook counts 17

‎[12.02.24, 22:42:33] ~ Ecomcesar: ‎image omitted
[12.02.24, 22:42:57] ~ Ecomcesar: you can see it tracks upsells and downsells as another purchase
[12.02.24, 22:45:39] ~ Nim: it would show this regardless for upsells/downsells
[12.02.24, 22:45:43] ~ Ecomcesar: this is wetrack
‎[12.02.24, 22:45:47] ~ Ecomcesar: ‎image omitted
[12.02.24, 22:46:10] ~ Ecomcesar: unique purchases are only 13
[12.02.24, 22:46:18] ~ Ecomcesar: and it changes a lot optimization
[12.02.24, 22:49:18] ~ Nim: hmmmm....apart from bundling ..... you might be doule-attributing
[12.02.24, 22:49:32] ~ Nim: have you uninstalled the Facebook & Instagram app
[12.02.24, 22:49:40] ~ Ecomcesar: yes i have
[12.02.24, 22:49:48] ~ Ecomcesar: no pixel native installed
[12.02.24, 22:49:54] ~ Ecomcesar: only with wetrack code
[12.02.24, 22:52:00] ~ Nim: now for every product you have created in every step, for each of their Automations, have you confirmed they are ALL bundling, and have timers of 5+ minutes on each
[12.02.24, 22:52:19] ~ Nim: ie. you haven't missed out bundling on perhaps some of the products
[12.02.24, 22:52:46] ~ Ecomcesar: no all bundeling and sending correctly to shopify
[12.02.24, 22:53:20] ~ Ecomcesar: you refer to shopify automation right?
[12.02.24, 22:53:07] ~ Nim: yes
[12.02.24, 22:53:39] ~ Ecomcesar: yes they are all right!
[12.02.24, 22:57:58] ~ Nim: not sure in that case mate
[12.02.24, 23:01:09] ~ Ecomcesar: thaks for your help @⁨~Nim⁩
[12.02.24, 23:01:20] ~ Ecomcesar: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ do you have ay suggestion to solve this issue?
[12.02.24, 23:01:32] ~ Ecomcesar: 🙏
[13.02.24, 2:58:17] ~ Farhat Godil: Quick question: does facebook discriminate against BMs with no spend vs BM’s with millions of spends?

I am posting ads on new BM with barely any spend and have trouble getting them approved. 

Whereas posting the same ads in BM with millions in spends getting approved right away
[13.02.24, 3:07:20] ~ Matt: It’s not necessarily discrimination. It’s more like trust. 

A bm with a lot of spend has an established credibility with Fb. 

Fb is just a content delivery machine. It can trust the content of an established bm. It can’t always trust a brand new bm
[13.02.24, 3:11:49] ~ Farhat Godil: Makes sense
[13.02.24, 11:27:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys, what would be a normal opt in -> purchase ratio in France? Heard that CVR overall is lower there but the costs of advertising make up for it
[13.02.24, 12:20:44] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Hello guys, does anyone have a reliable contact to buy fb bm’s with no spending limits?
[13.02.24, 12:38:33] ~ G M: Dm me
[13.02.24, 14:25:23] ~ Denys: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[13.02.24, 17:18:11] ~ Marko: What do you guys do for customer support at this point? I am working with these guys that use an AI chatbot that basically answers 95% of customer support queries. A lot cheaper and higher customer satisfaction. Really impressed by the quality
[13.02.24, 17:18:42] ~ Marko: They only work with brands that are doing >1M a year though
[13.02.24, 17:19:07] Bob: How much does this cost per month? Seems very interesting, and hear more and more people that offer this
[13.02.24, 17:19:21] Bob: We still have a VA answering everything atm
[13.02.24, 17:20:01] ~ Bryan T: Would love more info on this
[13.02.24, 17:20:10] ~ Marko: It depends on volume i think but def cheaper than a va
[13.02.24, 17:20:38] Bob: Okay makes sense!
[13.02.24, 17:32:25] ~ Marko: Okay yeah send me a dm. Working with them directly and don’t want to send out direcht contact details in a group
[13.02.24, 17:49:53] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Gorgias, but it's expensive
[13.02.24, 17:52:30] ~ Marko: How much are you paying?
[13.02.24, 17:58:58] ~ Marko: Also do they handle refunds and more complicated stuff?
[13.02.24, 17:59:13] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I am in the basic plan, like 60 a month, but it depends on the number of tickets you have
[13.02.24, 17:59:32] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Yeah I think it is one of the leading apps for customer service
[13.02.24, 17:59:46] ~ Alessandro Sassi: With automations, ai, macros, etc
[13.02.24, 18:00:05] ~ Marko: How is 60 bucks expensive if it replaced your entire customer service haha
[13.02.24, 18:00:30] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I don't have many tickets at the moment
[13.02.24, 18:00:39] ~ Alessandro Sassi: But you can easily spend 3-5k a month
[13.02.24, 18:00:45] ~ Marko: Ah okay
[13.02.24, 18:19:48] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: will the VSL and advertorials webinar starting any time soon?
[13.02.24, 18:26:04] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anything i can enable/disable in funnelish/stripe for 3DS failed payments? Or anything i can do to minimize it?
[13.02.24, 20:02:23] ~ Farhat Godil: Is everyone’s accounts spending at the normal pace? I am noticing most of my accounts are not spending today
[13.02.24, 21:05:07] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: I'm behind on my usual spend as well today, a few hrs left in the day but only 50% spend.
[13.02.24, 23:03:14] ~ Malik: My 2 accounts overspent today lol
‎[14.02.24, 0:56:06] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: ‎image omitted
[14.02.24, 13:25:45] ~ RS: Anybody knows some good Agents that can do US trademark appliacation? There are chinese guys that stole my product name and put Amazon and ebay listings with my brand name etc.
[14.02.24, 13:26:20] ~ Harvey: @⁨~Avv. Isidoro Capuano⁩ can help
[14.02.24, 13:26:42] ~ RS: Thank you
[14.02.24, 13:26:53] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: Did they already register the trademark?
[14.02.24, 13:27:29] ~ RS: Nope they have not registered trademark. They just put Amazon and ebay listings with my products and brand name. Also they are running google ads with my product name
[14.02.24, 13:28:19] Marek Olszewski: I had the same happen to me, I know a guy, but it’s a lengthy process. You’ll wait approx 4-6 months
[14.02.24, 13:29:12] ~ RS: Do you think I cannot start reaching out to Amazon and ebay and ask them to take down these listings if my trademark application is still in process?
[14.02.24, 13:31:18] Marek Olszewski: You can, but it’s unlikely it will work. I personally needed my word mark registered
[14.02.24, 13:32:05] Marek Olszewski: Are they using your logo too>
[14.02.24, 13:32:31] ~ RS: Nope, they are using just my product name
[14.02.24, 13:34:12] ~ Maxi: Man same for me they use my name but a different product
[14.02.24, 13:34:15] Marek Olszewski: It’s harder to get your wordmark approved, and they know this, especially if your brand name includes common, basic words
[14.02.24, 13:34:30] Marek Olszewski: yeah, just preying on your search volume
[14.02.24, 13:34:59] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: Legally, to protect your IP, you have to file and register a trademark. After that, providers will see that they are breaching the law and will take them down
[14.02.24, 13:35:55] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: An application takes a few hours to be lodged and a a few months to complete. Of course providers will trust the application and most likely take them down. It’s also advised to issue a Notice to cease and desist for the misuse of the business name
[14.02.24, 13:36:01] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: Legally, that’s the procedure.
[14.02.24, 13:39:24] ~ RS: Okay I understand that. My brand name is general and there are other brands with similar name. But in these listings they just have my product name that I have in shopify. I think at first I will just change the product name. Most of my sales come from funnelish, and only a few customers every day search my brand name in google, and from google they go to my shopify store and buy. And in google they can find Amazon and ebay listings with my product name. So I think a short fix would be just to change the product name slightly
[14.02.24, 13:40:40] ~ LA: Some of the comments are inaccurate. You automatically have rights through mere usage if you have evidence you were first. You do NOT need a registered trademark to earn this right.

However you have to collect/pursue the claim which is a bigger hurdle and may not be worth it. ‎<This message was edited>
[14.02.24, 13:46:25] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: Technically speaking, how do you protect your IP? The best way is through a trademark or a patent
[14.02.24, 13:47:00] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: Unless in 2024 somebody came up with a different and efficient way to force counterparts’ hands.
[14.02.24, 13:50:25] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: Sometimes it would be best to check facts, applicable laws, international treaties, regulations and habits prior to labelling comments as inaccurate.*It is a long shot to claim rights without protection of your Intellectual property rights* and it’s also a bad recommendation if you advise to dive into something without legal counseling
[14.02.24, 13:58:07] ~ Sonu Duhra: @⁨~RS⁩ https://www.amazon.de/report/infringement
[14.02.24, 13:59:48] ~ Luka: Going through the same thing but in my country. They also made a replica of our box packaging, etc. they chatted to us as customers to get all the info about us so they sell the same way.

Not sure about the US, but trademark is the way to go. Takes time but worth it. Protects your brand/product then you can make legal claims and most sites will comply & take them down. Plus you can sue them if they refuse
[14.02.24, 14:00:47] ~ Luka: If they’re living in the US/EU you can send a legal warning letter. My brother did that to a person stealing his videos and the guy stopped.
[14.02.24, 15:56:33] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, do anyone have contact for a funnelish/advertorial builder? We would need to outsource this to someone who can help us building these advertorials.
[14.02.24, 15:56:48] Topi: Yeah will pm
[14.02.24, 16:05:03] Alex  Fedotoff: We use ruth@trademarkelite.com for trademark protection
[14.02.24, 20:08:17] ~ Natasha Iris: Happy humpday guys! On today’s payments call, we’ll talk specifically about selling internationally in the US, EU, UK and AUS.  With certain processors you can actually have better performance on authorization rates vs. traditional payment providers.  Learn what benchmark authorization rates are for each region and learn how to compare that to what you are receiving with your provider.

Here's the link to the ESS calendar to view when will it take place based on your timezone:
https://www.skool.com/ess3/calendar
[15.02.24, 1:40:58] ~ RS: Is everything good with your FB ads? Its 1:40 AM for my ad acc time zone and it spent 30% of entire daily budget in last 40 minutes. And CPM went from 15$ to 200$ for some campaigns
[15.02.24, 1:45:58] ~ RS: 3 of my campaigns spent 50% of daily budget in 1hour. Metastatus seems Ok
[15.02.24, 1:46:37] ~ Farhat Godil: I am seeing huge drop in performance today
[15.02.24, 2:11:30] ~ RS: Guys, check your ads
‎[15.02.24, 2:11:34] ~ RS: ‎image omitted
[15.02.24, 2:12:01] ~ RS: I turned off almost all my campaigns. It spend 50% budget in 20 minutes.
[15.02.24, 2:12:53] ~ RS: The problem started just over a hour ago. And only now in metastatus it shows that there are disruptions
[15.02.24, 2:24:30] ~ RS: I checked twitter, there are guys also writing about FB blowing budget in minutes. Check your ads guys
[15.02.24, 6:28:45] ~ Alessandro: Same here
[15.02.24, 6:29:33] ~ Alessandro: Do you think they will refund that?
[15.02.24, 6:31:03] ~ Alessandro: My timezone is Italy. 5.30 am now
And my campaign spent already the 75% of his budget
[15.02.24, 6:56:24] ~ seth: You can try contact them for it, but the chances are low. I had the same problem last year; in 30 minutes, it spent all the budget. When I contacted support, they said, 'It's because Facebook optimized impressions.'
[15.02.24, 6:58:24] ~ Alessandro: That’s insane
[15.02.24, 7:00:26] ~ seth: lost about $3k and still remember haha
[15.02.24, 7:02:51] ~ seth: I'm also have a problem for the last couple weeks, my page got disappear or deleted, I can't find it in the BM, there is no email or notification about what happen. I trying to contact Meta's support but they don't reply my email. Does anyone know how to contact Meta support?
[15.02.24, 7:03:53] ~ Farhat Godil: When this happened last year they did refund me 5k. Just reach out to your rep
[15.02.24, 7:09:12] ~ Alessandro: I will reach them now
[15.02.24, 8:02:15] ~ Mircea Cibric: 1.5k at 0.43 ROAS, nice...
‎[15.02.24, 8:29:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: ‎image omitted
[15.02.24, 8:31:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I am getting the same in Netherlands as well, lots of opt ins no sales. 

In germany the ratio is 1/2 so thats fine. The only difference between the countries is that germany runs om paypal/klarna directly and netherlands and france are running through stripe
[15.02.24, 8:32:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Now i wouldve thought for sure that stripe is the problem, but although there are many optins, there are not super many failed payments (still a handfull though)
‎[15.02.24, 9:06:52] ~ Daniel: ‎image omitted
‎[15.02.24, 9:08:09] ~ Daniel: ‎image omitted
[15.02.24, 9:08:34] ~ Daniel: last time they did this they refunded everyone
‎[15.02.24, 9:59:54] ~ Daniel: ‎image omitted
[15.02.24, 9:59:54] ~ Daniel: anyone else got?
[15.02.24, 9:22:21] ~ seth: they refund all the adspent today for you?
[15.02.24, 9:23:23] ~ Daniel: I’ve spent about $11k today
[15.02.24, 9:23:50] ~ Daniel: I meant it’s a small amount compared to the drop in performance
[15.02.24, 9:24:03] ~ Daniel: last year I spent $6k during that day & they refunded $1.6k
[15.02.24, 9:26:12] ~ seth: I use agency account so not sure how to get that $ back
[15.02.24, 9:26:49] ~ Daniel: idk it was automatically last year, I didn’t request it
[15.02.24, 9:28:06] ~ RS: Same for me. I messaged my agency. Will see how they will handle the situation. I turned off all my ads so not only lost money but also lost optimization
[15.02.24, 9:28:29] ~ Alessandro: You contacted them to receive the refund?
[15.02.24, 9:28:33] ~ Daniel: hey man, how bad was it for you?
[15.02.24, 9:28:51] ~ Daniel: you noticed it at the start & turned off right away?
[15.02.24, 9:30:21] ~ RS: Hey, it spent more than 50% budget even though I noticed it at the start and turned off 😀 I noticed it before it was announced on metastatus. I tought that I was the only one with this issue because nobody answered to me here, and also there were no tweets in Twitter about that
[15.02.24, 9:31:53] ~ Daniel: ohh man, I feel you… hopefully they refund everyone
[15.02.24, 9:32:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Mine actually didnt spend
[15.02.24, 9:33:43] ~ Daniel: no I didn’t, if you’re asking me
[15.02.24, 9:34:02] ~ seth: I was just wakeup this morning, thanks to @⁨~RS⁩ message and go turn off my ads, so I loss not much
[15.02.24, 9:34:41] ~ Nicco: everyone had this problem? for me the roas is the same as yesterday
[15.02.24, 9:53:30] ~ seth: i have 2 store run on 2 different account, 1 had this issue 1 is normal, so i think its not everyone had this problem
[15.02.24, 11:50:02] ~ Maxi: is the facebook issue gone ?

[19.02.24, 11:36:08] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: How do you send people from a funnelish page to a shopify checkout?
[19.02.24, 11:43:36] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I believe you will have to let someone code it so you get the right variant in shopify checkout
[19.02.24, 11:43:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Just using URL doesnt work
[19.02.24, 11:49:24] ~ Memed: You can do it with Url, you just have to find the product variant code, i think there are some youtube video on this matter
[19.02.24, 11:50:06] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Alright will check it out!
[19.02.24, 11:50:07] ~ Sonu Duhra: Richi suggested this to me, if you want the Shopify checkout, then you should create the whole funnel within Shopify with Gempages.
[19.02.24, 11:50:39] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Yeah saw this aswell, will see what works best
[19.02.24, 11:51:47] ~ Sonu Duhra: otherwise whats the point, most use Funnelish because of the customizable checkout and upsells
[19.02.24, 11:56:37] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I also made the page in pagefly
[19.02.24, 11:56:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: it looks better then funnelish imo
[19.02.24, 14:44:07] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is there a way to add text blocks in a shopify checkout without having shopify plus? Or is that simply not possible.
[19.02.24, 15:03:45] ~ Kamal: I don’t think it’s possible without shopify plus

It is possible right to make a CTA where if they click on it, a discount will be automatically applied on checkout? 

I saw the format i need for klaviyo was this: {{ event.extra.checkout_url }}&discount={% coupon_code 'CouponName' %}

But its not working for me for some reason
[20.02.24, 11:04:58] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I made the coupon in klaviyo, maybe thats the problem

Too see ads made in 2021-2022 for example
[21.02.24, 12:06:51] ~ Malik: Adspy I would say
[21.02.24, 12:12:42] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Do you guys believe that an Advertorial can be too long?
[21.02.24, 12:13:21] ~ Mikael: I noticed this when running ads in sweden. But it can ofcourse depend i guess
[21.02.24, 12:28:52] ~ David B: You need to edit advertorials ruthlessly, especially for mobile view. 

If a sentence isn't adding value or moving the story along, cut it. 

Long-form advertorials can be very effective if the audience is prepared for it through the ads. 

Another option is to change an advertorial into a VSL. VSLs are lower friction and require less effort so they are more likely to be watched. 

Check your heat maps and see how much of your advertorial is being read if you see a drop off at a certain point, it needs to be reworked.
[21.02.24, 12:29:46] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Sure will do. Could I send a PM?
[21.02.24, 12:29:56] ~ David B: Of course.
[21.02.24, 14:10:50] ~ Daniel: hey guys, I’m running my funnel in the US now, and want to test TOP 5 countries, do I need to create a geo funnel with $NZD for New Zealand, $AUD for Australia etc., or should I run them all with USD?

[21.02.24, 18:41:17] ~ G M: It comes out because you requested that your page be categorized as not doing online sales, and evidently fb rejected you.

[22.02.24, 11:00:02] Marek Olszewski: chase, bank of america and citi are good, but they will require a physical location in the US

[23.02.24, 12:05:06] ~ Kevin kreative: how is your feedback? I know the founder IRL. Pretty close. I'm currently using TripleWhale lol. Plan to move to TrueProfit if the app is good
[23.02.24, 12:06:42] ~ RS: I dont think that truprofit is better that triple whale. In truprofit you can just see your expenses, profits , etc
[23.02.24, 12:08:23] ~ Kevin kreative: yeah, of course TripleWhale is top 1. The reason that TripleWhale makes me consider changing is the pricing increase when we operate several stores
[23.02.24, 12:28:24] ~ Alessandro Sassi: How does it compare to SMS Bump?

[23.02.24, 22:32:55] ~ L: Had the same issue when I was selling in France huge drop from ic to pur for 2 of my store I had there
[23.02.24, 22:39:03] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Its kinda crazy jeah
[23.02.24, 22:39:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But i wonder if i have a lot of 3DS failed payments again because i use Shopify payments on UK
[23.02.24, 22:43:23] ~ Mike Ramsey: If UK entity selling to EU customer likely 2 (or more) out of every 10 customers will false decline because you are selling cross border.  The issuing bank will flag it as fraud even if customer has funds because they are now interacting with a business outside of their domestic footprint.  They will need to call their bank to authorize transaction or use a bank transfer payment option where they push funds to you.
[23.02.24, 22:44:48] ~ Mike Ramsey: Reason codes can vary depending on issuing bank - most banks just label it as ‘decline’ which is a sign that it is a cross border transaction and likely a false decline.  If you get specific details such as ‘do not honor,’ then that is likely a legitimate bad transaction. ‎<This message was edited>
[23.02.24, 22:47:42] ~ L: Yes I’ve heard about this issue with UK Ltd , but I was using stripe with a US LLC and the same issue happened 

I don’t know
[23.02.24, 22:48:01] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Its the same thing as its cross border
[23.02.24, 22:48:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Best would be EU processing for EU countries
[23.02.24, 22:49:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So this could be a big part of the problem then, i wondered why a lot of payments came from Apple Pay and PayPal, a few Mastercards but almost no Visa payments
[23.02.24, 22:50:03] ~ Mike Ramsey: Anytime a customer interacts with an business entity outside of their home country false declines will happen.  US entity selling to EU customer would provoke the same behavior on declines
[23.02.24, 22:51:44] ~ Mike Ramsey: Benchmark data is about 80% approval rate for UK / US / AUS selling to EU.  I’ve seen it as bad as 60%
[23.02.24, 22:52:06] ~ Mike Ramsey: Domestic benchmark approval rates EU to EU is about 93%
[23.02.24, 22:52:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: That makes sense
[23.02.24, 22:52:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Then still my numbers are way off, even if it is 60%
[23.02.24, 22:53:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But i checked, about 50 people added al their info (that are actually in the abandoned checkout list)  which of only 16 have actually managed to place the order
[23.02.24, 22:53:56] ~ Mike Ramsey: If less then 60% something is really wrong
[23.02.24, 22:54:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And then of those 16 orders like 6 are from PayPal
[23.02.24, 22:54:05] ~ Mike Ramsey: Should never be less than that UK to EU
[23.02.24, 22:54:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And 4/5 are apple Pay hahah
[23.02.24, 22:55:04] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Will try and find out somewhere in Shopify if i can see it anywhere
[23.02.24, 22:55:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Maybe the chat can help me
[23.02.24, 22:57:14] ~ Mike Ramsey: Wallets won’t have false decline issues processing cross border like cards but the rates are shitty. So get the reason codes from Shopify to verify your 3DS settings are in line.
[23.02.24, 22:58:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah thats what i thought, and France should be 70/80% creditcard so it doesnt make any sense to me. 

I talked to Stripe as well and they told me that because my Stripe is fairly new they have this Radar set on hyper modus to protect my account (and Stripe) the best
[23.02.24, 22:58:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So i switched to Shopify payments but its not better (although this is still Stripe, i thought that Radar wouldnt be so strict)
[24.02.24, 5:46:53] ~ Kevin kreative: Guys, we have 8 Stripe accounts ready to scale. If anyone need Stripe, just contact @⁨~Thomas Tran⁩

We're looking for a solution to clean this flag

What's more, it's not legitimate, it's due to a number of false DMCAs and we've countered each time by recreating a number of pages, all of which were then blocked, and now we're flagged.

We were looking for a way to clean up this flag so we wouldn't have to change domains.

A lawyer is on the case, but we need to be able to publish quickly.
[28.02.24, 14:56:28] ~ Amelia Nguyen: Hi everyone, does anyone here have store launch in different countries? I’m launching my store in Japan but Im not sure how to go about it. Please let me know. I would like to ask for some advise. Thanks in advance
[28.02.24, 17:25:37] ~ Harout: anyone knows how we can whitelist our Instagram account or find a way so it doesn't get action blocked/trigger suspicious activity?
we need 5 people logging into it for sourcing influencers etc
[28.02.24, 17:31:14] Topi: Yeah pm
[28.02.24, 19:20:15] ~ Mohammed-amine: Hey @⁨~lengjoo⁩ how was Recharm?
[28.02.24, 20:02:12] ~ Natasha Iris: ‎This message was deleted.
[28.02.24, 20:18:15] ~ Natasha Iris: Hi guys todays payments call will be postponed for next week due to Affiliate World Summit. 

For our next call we will be discussing everything copy! Insights, updates and scaling through copy. As well as testing tips. 

See you then!
[28.02.24, 20:20:32] ~ lengjoo: expensive 😂 but it takes a long time to upload all your content if you have a lot so we’re just spending the first 2 months uploading all our content and organising it
[28.02.24, 20:20:49] ~ lengjoo: haven’t seen the effect for our video editors because they’re still waiting for the content to be fully organised
[28.02.24, 20:21:00] ~ lengjoo: their interface is really nice though
[28.02.24, 20:50:43] ~ Dr Tim: UK based guys, how are you dealing with VAT? Is there a workaround for ecom operators?
[28.02.24, 20:51:41] ~ Dr Tim: Got a letter today asking for VAT that is almost equal to my total revenue 😂😂 it's ridiculous.

Spoken with an accountant already but wondering if there's provision to walkaround this entirely
[28.02.24, 20:52:52] ~ RS: Do you sell with UK company to EU customers without paying VAT? 😀
[28.02.24, 20:55:00] ~ L: I've had many calls with a lot of accountants and it looks like there's no workaround for the VAT In europe - CESOP (from what they claim) will see your revenue and they'll ask you to pay VAT eventually
[28.02.24, 20:55:27] ~ Dr Tim: UK company. UK residents
[28.02.24, 20:56:52] ~ L: It turned out a lot of people are opening LTDs or LLCs with a pakistan or hong kong nominee so that it'll be harder for EU to find the actual owner of the LTD/LLC
[28.02.24, 20:57:20] ~ L: UK clients or EU clients?
[28.02.24, 20:57:41] ~ Dr Tim: UK customers.
[28.02.24, 20:58:00] ~ RS: Yeah I stopped selling to EU after the law changed in July 2021
[28.02.24, 20:58:37] ~ L: CESOP came this year 2024
[28.02.24, 20:59:26] ~ RS: Since 2021 you needed to pay VAT if you sell to EU with EU company. CESOP is something different and more strict from what I have heard
[28.02.24, 20:59:40] ~ L: So you don't fall under the CESOP - but since you're UK resident with a UK LTD and UK customers i think there's not so much you can do
[28.02.24, 21:00:05] ~ Jeremy Leppink: There were other work arounds for this shortly after June 2021
[28.02.24, 21:00:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I got the agreement even with tax government
[28.02.24, 21:00:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: In the Netherlands
[28.02.24, 21:00:45] ~ L: I've heard that too, but with CESOP it's not doable anymore
[28.02.24, 21:00:47] ~ Dr Tim: I can change my market if that's a problem. Not beholden to the UK market
[28.02.24, 21:00:53] ~ RS: Because you shipped products from China to EU, you dont need to pay VAT of your product price?
[28.02.24, 21:01:36] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Why do you think that? CESOP is just a controlling system in my eyes, as long as you follow the exact rules, then you should be good
[28.02.24, 21:02:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So the simple explanation is, dont request a IOSS, ship DDU,  the delivery takes place in China (on paper) which makes the customer liable for import & VAT
[28.02.24, 21:02:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: VAT gets payed in China
[28.02.24, 21:02:34] ~ L: I've been told that from dutch accountants
[28.02.24, 21:02:45] ~ Mohammed-amine: damn we're in the same boat then ‎<This message was edited>
[28.02.24, 21:03:11] ~ Mohammed-amine: can't be paying $$/month to just wait for content to upload for 2 months ‎<This message was edited>
[28.02.24, 21:03:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Not paying VAT is grey area, it is now and will probably always be
[28.02.24, 21:04:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Oh and the disclaimer, i am no accountant, this is no financial advice 😅😂
[28.02.24, 21:04:38] ~ L: There was a workaround where basically you can sign a contract with your supplier saying you want him to ship everything DDU - He won't actually do it - so that when the government asks you about not-paid VAT you can show them that you have a contract saying that every product is shipped from china and that the customer should take care of VAT
[28.02.24, 21:05:39] ~ L: Exactly
[28.02.24, 21:06:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah you basically become the 3rd party
[28.02.24, 21:06:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I think its called a ABC structure
[28.02.24, 21:07:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For the guys still handling this, its not allowed in Belgium as they actually have a seperate law for this
[28.02.24, 21:07:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And its only reviewed and approved in the Netherlands, so all other EU countries we dont know
[28.02.24, 21:08:16] ~ L: Last time I talked with a Dutch accountant they told me this isn't possible anymore tho
[28.02.24, 21:08:28] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I am doing this also, hopefully it won’t come at a later time😅 but my accountant said that as I am not importing the product, the customer is.
[28.02.24, 21:08:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Right, its pretty much based on the import guys not checking up on your packages
[28.02.24, 21:09:12] ~ Dr Tim: Warehouse is in China. CJ is shipping to customer.

Why should I pay the VAT? 🤔
[28.02.24, 21:09:22] ~ L: and you make your customer pay for VAT? or you ship with the supplier IOSS?
[28.02.24, 21:09:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: As long as they let the packages through without checking them, your customers are not getting any bills
[28.02.24, 21:09:59] ~ L: There are 2 types of VAT - the one for "Import" and the one on the Sale price
[28.02.24, 21:10:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I do this still as well, but now i would say the HK structure is more safe
[28.02.24, 21:10:41] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Although its a bit shady imo
[28.02.24, 21:11:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You just give the responsibility to the nominee
[28.02.24, 21:11:51] ~ L: Hong Kong structure and LTD with nominee (these are the 2 main options) is in both cases a little bit shady, even because it'll be a little difficult to send money to you
[28.02.24, 21:12:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah
[28.02.24, 21:13:21] ~ lengjoo: ya was kinda annoyed by that so requested for more manpower behind us
[28.02.24, 21:14:29] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I don’t have an IOSS, pretty sure the customer pays for VAT
[28.02.24, 21:15:42] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Where are you selling now? Only US?
[28.02.24, 21:16:24] ~ RS: Mainly big4. Sometimes in other countries but everything outside EU
[28.02.24, 21:16:51] ~ L: no one complains? 😂
[28.02.24, 21:16:53] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Usually in these cases it's the agent that uses his IOSS
[28.02.24, 21:17:49] ~ L: If the agent is using his IOSS you're not shipping DDU tho 😅
[28.02.24, 21:19:49] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Had some in the beginning but not really
[28.02.24, 21:28:33] ~ Eric R: Does anyone know how to add Google Recaptcha into Funnelish?
[28.02.24, 22:22:41] ~ RS: Guys who run long form VSL (over 5 minutes), do you run only on FB feed placement?
[28.02.24, 22:32:57] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: No all placements and let’s facebook choose
[28.02.24, 22:34:17] ~ Niels: Do you run with one dimension in that case, or several? (f.e. 1080x1080 px & 1920x1080)
[28.02.24, 22:36:19] ~ RS: I ran mine VSLs for 2 weeks and performance dropped a lot. Checked breakdown, basically the only profitable placement (and with highest spend) is FB feeds. In the first week Also FB reels was very profitable but past week FB reels in all campaigns is just wasting money with thousands spent with under 1 roas. Its interesting why the first days the VSL in FB reels worked with over 3 roas but after a week below 1 roas
[28.02.24, 22:37:18] ~ RS: Instagram just spent all the money for 2 weeks unprofitably. Have you checked your breakdown?
[28.02.24, 22:37:18] ~ L: when this happen do you guys usually remove the placements that don't work (and where it spent too much) or not?
[28.02.24, 22:38:19] ~ RS: I now made New campaigns without these placements. Just leave FB feed and video feeds (these were the only profitable placements in a week). I think that you should not edit your existing campaigns and remove some placements. But who knows
[28.02.24, 22:39:13] ~ RS: @⁨Serhii Biletskyi⁩ Hey man, mby you have some opinion on this?
[28.02.24, 22:41:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I have the exact same, broke down my ads today, its spending 40% of the budget on reels while those are doing roas <1, while feeds to about roas 2.5/2.8
[28.02.24, 22:41:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So launched new campaign for tomorrow testing only fb/IG feed
[28.02.24, 22:42:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I actually discussed this with Serhii like 4 hours ago, he recommended me to test only fb/ig feed
[28.02.24, 22:43:09] ~ RS: Haha, when I launched my VSLs, I put almost all placements with a thought that I will check breakdown after a few days to know on what to double down. But I forgot that for 2 weeks, and when now I checked breakdown, I see that for last 3 days i have many unprofitable campaigns where feeds are roas over 2, but the rest of budget are spent on some reels or IG totally unprofitably😀
[28.02.24, 22:45:57] ~ RS: Do IG feeds work for you? My current VSL is 9 minutes long. But now I see that actually IG feeds are not so bad for me. It just gets a very low spend, only up to 5% of spend goes to ig feeds. Its worth giving IG feeds a try to spend more
[28.02.24, 22:49:31] ~ Alessandro Sassi: My VSL spends more on IG feed than FB. 4 mins long
[28.02.24, 22:50:43] ~ RS: Whats your age range? My top audience is mostly over 50. And not a beauty niche, so Maybe that is why its spending low amount to IG feed
[28.02.24, 22:53:26] ~ Alessandro Sassi: yeah it could be, my main age range is 35-44
[28.02.24, 22:53:54] ~ Alessandro Sassi: 35-54*
[28.02.24, 23:00:47] ~ RS: Makes sense
[28.02.24, 23:01:08] ~ Omid: Yes just isolating the placements that work the best currently in your next campaign is best no need to remove from current ‎<This message was edited>
[28.02.24, 23:01:15] ~ Omid: Does anyone here have a TikTok shops rep
[28.02.24, 23:01:25] ~ Omid: If so please pm
[28.02.24, 23:03:40] ~ L: Thank you
[28.02.24, 23:25:57] ~ Mohammed-amine: Anyone here went through Iron media training?
[28.02.24, 23:26:23] ~ Mohammed-amine: Sebastiab szalinski program
[28.02.24, 23:30:36] ~ EasyGloss (Anela): yeeesss! about 4 years ago. basically, he hand holds you. i wouldnt say i learned anything spectacular. i cant remember one single thing. if you re a hardcore beginner i think it wil be good for you but i dont believe you are. and then he stole my store screenshot, it was 400k+ Euro. he used it for his ads saying he generated this but that was before i worked with him. and he did that to a few other students that he worked with that i met. so his entire marketing is not really honest which i cant stand anymore these days
[28.02.24, 23:31:25] ~ EasyGloss (Anela): i think back then he was chargning me 6 or 7k per month and i think i did it for 6 months - but not too sure about these details now. please take it with a grain of salt - or whatever that english saying is😄
[28.02.24, 23:32:45] ~ EasyGloss (Anela): but let me add i dont have anything against him personally and i am sure that for some people, he brought in some results. and maybe he has fine tuned his services now 4 yrs later
[29.02.24, 8:39:22] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team!!! Can’t make it tomorrow’s QA call! If you have any questions or things you want to cover hit me up directly

[29.02.24, 18:25:22] ~ Kyle Twohill: do any of you guys have tipping on at checkout in shopify? does it lower cr at all ?

[1.03.24, 11:28:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys, quick question. I just checked FB link clicks vs actual visitors in shopify, and there is a huge dropoff, was wondering if this is normal;

FB says: 3559
Shopify all visitors: 2518
Shopify social channel visitors: 1900 

Seems like a pretty big dropoff
[1.03.24, 11:42:21] ~ Ignasi: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.

[1.03.24, 14:44:29] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: For guys that using Proxy
What can you do to gain speed on your browsers?

Managing facebook on it takes time for all my team

Do you know how to optimize?
[1.03.24, 14:45:36] ~ L: I'm using ADSpower and MPP and it's acceptable - not super fast but acceptable
[1.03.24, 14:47:52] ~ G M: Dolphin anty (best anti detect browser) - my private proxy.

From 3 months, I don’t use proxies anymore, I have 20+ profiles, and I don’t feel the difference anymore, of using or not using. No bans on profiles, no nothing.

But only thing you must use a good anti detect browser
[1.03.24, 14:51:03] ~ Allan L: Managed over 1000 ad accounts yearly when I did affiliate marketingwith multiloginapp, changed to AdsPower after swapping to e-com where I dont need that many browsers.
However, using residential IPs will be slow, specially if You're located far away from the IP location. Consider looking at static residential IPs near you or your team member. Those will help drastically in terms of speed :) 

Currently I am using AdsPower and Residential static IPs from UK (Living in Denmark) and I barely notice the speed difference compared to my normal regular browser.
[1.03.24, 14:56:44] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys, I’m having issues with withdrawals on PayPal of currencies different from EUR.

Can't withdraw more than 2-3K of USD equivalent daily, or even less sometimes.

Not sure if it's a PayPal or Wise problem, as I have virtual cards for each currency linked to PayPal.

Very frustrating, did anyone have this issue and solved?
[1.03.24, 15:30:22] ~ RS: Guys, do you also test new advertorials for the same angle to keep ad performance consistant? Not only test new ads all the time
[1.03.24, 16:14:56] ~ Thomas Dolcini: A
[1.03.24, 16:22:21] ~ Maxi: Yes, we test 3-4 advertorials weekly ‎<This message was edited>
[1.03.24, 16:23:08] ~ Daniel: hey man, it’s usually the bank, it was the same for me, I messaged PayPal, and they said there is no withdrawal limit for my account, but then I called my bank, and they said it is
[1.03.24, 16:31:04] ~ Kamal: What's the purpose of using a proxy, is it if you're managing multiple fb ad accounts?

If we have just 1 ad account do we need to have our team all using the same IP/location or is it fine if they're all over the world?
[1.03.24, 16:32:57] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Ok thanks, I will try to check with Wise

There is good agency accounts we can connect you with that have no fees, I can for sure say work but not post payment like your looking for
[5.03.24, 8:15:15] ~ Allan L: Sadly one supporter from The live chat screwed up and requested manual review on every single rejected ad on one of my ad account which caused it to be disabled.
[5.03.24, 12:38:46] ~ Kevin kreative: Anyone knows good agency design CheckoutChamp

[5.03.24, 22:31:57] Bob: Did anyone see a dramatic change in their fb performance today? Thought if it could've had something to do with Meta being down today
[5.03.24, 22:57:18] ~ Nils: I would recommend reading the book Thinking in bets or read some other book that discusses cognitive biases. If someone would answer that they were seeing the same things as you you would get your idea confirmed in your mind. At the same time though there might literally have been 1000s of advertisers who did not see a dramatic change in performance today. Just food for thought :)
[5.03.24, 22:58:59] Bob: Appreciate that a lot man, that totally makes sense. Was honestly thinking about that when I send the message that I was kinda looking for a confirmation. Will check it out!
[5.03.24, 23:22:16] ~ Nils: 🙏🙏 Awesome man was not meant to be judgy or anything in that direction. Just want everybody to correct each others thinking in this group wherever possible including myself if i write something that might not resonate i would love to be called out👍

[7.03.24, 8:40:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone here that linked funnelish and shopify together and knows how to fix the tracking? 

I have advertorials on funnelish and redirect hem to shopify salespage (also testing advertorial to salespage on funnelish and then redirect to shopify checkout, dont have a other payment provider at the moment so thats why)

I am split testing the advertorials but i have no clue which one is doing better/converting better atm.
[7.03.24, 10:00:01] ~ Y: Pm me the details I’ll guide you through it
[7.03.24, 13:59:29] Matán Intsuper: You can use utm tags
[7.03.24, 14:48:41] ~ Mikael: We track this with hyros and added the hyros tracking code to all funnelish pages. Works fine
[7.03.24, 14:50:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Interesting, thanks!
[7.03.24, 14:52:13] ~ seth: Hydro is expensive when scaling, do you plan plan on changing to a different app?
[7.03.24, 14:52:34] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, 
My friend built a awesome ai support system that automates about 90-95% of your support cases. 
Price is also very good. 
Im using it for 2 of my stores for afew month now.
Is anyone interested to hear more about it?
[7.03.24, 14:53:04] ~ Mikael: No not atm and yes its costly. I think wetracked is alot cheaper tho. But i have no experience with it
[7.03.24, 16:01:59] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Hey guys, while I do research it always happens that I see ads that are active for a long time and for that reason I want to check out their website, for a lot of these websites when I click on the cta or search up the website manually I get an error and I’m never able to see it.
[7.03.24, 16:02:43] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Is there a workaround for this because I even tried with a vpn
[7.03.24, 16:31:18] ~ Pavel in HK: if the site is no longer active then can use https://web.archive.org/ to see how it looked like
[7.03.24, 16:32:57] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Thank you, but why are the ads active is the website is down? Is it Facebook that is not reporting it right?
[8.03.24, 15:40:58] ~ Peter: Hi guys, quick couple of questions; how do you run your ads these days? Just broad? Or also separate retargeting? Also how many creatives do you guys test to stay consistent with scaling? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.03.24, 15:43:30] ~ L: Advantage + creative test 

And noticing that a campaign to test advertorial is needed too

[11.03.24, 12:08:38] ~ Alessandro Sassi: A friend is doing ecom with woocommerce. It is great, it has many benefits like:
- lower transaction fees compared to shopify payments
- less recurring costs thanks to installing plugins instead of Shopify apps
- can integrate multiple payment methods easily, and that work with every currency
- checkout customizable
- and he can download the store as a template and import when he wants to create a new one, saving so much time

[11.03.24, 18:59:44] ~ Daniel: hey man, I just click on “open facebook post with comments” in the ads manager, then copy the link of the post, and open it in a new tab, and copy the ID of the video, it’s not the post ID, but if you paste it when creating a new AD facebook will tell you that you should use the post ID instead, and send the post ID
[11.03.24, 19:02:17] ~ Malik: This option is not available anymore on my ad account "open facebook post with comments". That's the problem I'm facing

[14.03.24, 11:42:03] ~ Dr Tim: Guys running in the UK, do you include VAT separately in your pricing?
[14.03.24, 16:11:32] ~ Andreas Brepohl: I am so done with “creators” and am casting now actors for making ads atm. Best one so far: https://en.stagepool.com/cvbase/
[14.03.24, 16:13:37] ~ Allan L: Interesting. Sent you a PM with some questions :)
[14.03.24, 16:14:04] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, had some trouble with my Internet the last half hour so couldnt start the content call yet. Will start in 10 Minutes!:)

[15.03.24, 11:45:28] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hello Guys,
Any tips to open a Tik Tok US account from Europe?

The goal is to have an organic us account
‎[15.03.24, 13:03:01] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: ‎image omitted
[15.03.24, 13:04:34] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You can change that in your klarna merchant account indeed, do you have access to a klarna merchant if you integrate it with stripe?
[15.03.24, 13:04:57] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I dont have a Klarna merchant. Everything is integrated only through stripe
[15.03.24, 13:06:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I see, good question. Maybe ask klarna if they can change it for you then. On shopify you have this klarna merchant app (but then again you have to connect your klarna account) where you can change it as well but for funnelish i dont know
[15.03.24, 13:06:54] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Yeah will check with them
[15.03.24, 13:08:12] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Stripe has to contact Klarna and request to change the brand name
[15.03.24, 13:08:39] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: This is how we did it back then with shopify payments, the customer support requested the brand name change
[15.03.24, 13:08:45] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Yeah thats what I told them aswell, but when I said that they say that they dont do that😅
[15.03.24, 13:08:54] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Yeah used to do this aswell with Shopify
[15.03.24, 13:11:10] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Check if you can get the Klarna merchant ID from stripe and then write an email to Klarna support to change the brand name
[15.03.24, 13:11:15] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: merchant@klarna.co.uk
[15.03.24, 13:11:59] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Klarna customer support is decent, they should be able to do that
[15.03.24, 17:48:20] ~ Daniel: hey everyone, for those who use Mercury, did they ever reject your payments to fb?

I’m using Mercury, and paying for ads with their card, but my transactions to Facebook failed even though I have funds to pay, and I tried several times but they fail, so I paid the billing with my personal card for now, but would like to pay with Mercury, and their support will answer in 1 business day, which will be on Monday, did anyone encounter this before?
[15.03.24, 19:01:08] ~ G M: Never happened to me, do you tried to verify the card in fb?
[15.03.24, 19:03:31] ~ Ecomcesar: Hello guys
[15.03.24, 19:03:48] ~ Daniel: what do you mean, how?
[15.03.24, 19:04:00] ~ Ecomcesar: Besides from privacy what any other multicard company would you recommend for a LLC ?
[15.03.24, 19:04:19] ~ Ecomcesar: In the usa to pay for facebok amd google ads ?
[15.03.24, 19:04:21] ~ G M: Sometimes can happen that card its not verified totally, or has insufficient funds bug, on it. Check in payment settings
[15.03.24, 19:04:24] ~ Ecomcesar: Thanks in advance ‎<This message was edited>

[16.03.24, 17:43:21] ~ Rick: Hey guys which payment providers they use in Australia ? Its mostly PayPal and CC right ? Or am I wrong ? Any Australians in here 😃😃
[16.03.24, 17:44:52] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: A few probably use AfterPay aswell
[16.03.24, 18:27:51] ~ Matt: Afterpay is very popular in Australia. They even have online shopping holidays called “afterpay day”

[17.03.24, 12:29:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys! What is the percentage on average in USA for creditcard and PayPal payments? Is PayPal a must in US?
[17.03.24, 12:30:33] ~ RS: Like 35% PayPal, 65% card for me
[17.03.24, 12:32:24] ~ RS: A while ago for my store, when i run it without PayPal, the results were much worse. Some say that if you remove PayPal, FB will optimize for card payers but i dont think so. I tested it many times and without PayPal it was very bad especially if your product price is over 70$
[17.03.24, 12:33:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Interesting, thanks for the feedback!
[17.03.24, 22:25:20] ~ RS: Hey! I see that recently very many guys use Facebook page names like Daily Beauty Tips or Pain Relief Tips instead of just putting your brand name as Facebook page name from which you run ads. Does it really improve CTR or some other stats on FB for you?
[18.03.24, 3:41:41] ~ Ecomcesar: guys quicj question!
[18.03.24, 3:42:02] ~ Ecomcesar: these payment methods from STRIPE are available in Funnelish

[18.03.24, 3:42:42] ~ Luka: Marin says it helps and seen pages do it. I tried making a fake AI specialist persona in my niche but it didn't outperform my brand page, but didn't try niche pages.
[18.03.24, 3:42:53] ~ Luka: Curious to hear how it did for others
[18.03.24, 7:28:17] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes I tried with a new funnel, it worked well, I took the winning creatives changed the page and URL, lost all the social proof but had the same CTR and performance, so I guess over time with gathering more social proof and engagement it can outperform the brand page
[18.03.24, 7:30:14] ~ Sonu Duhra: Anyone here that moved to Dubai with family?
[18.03.24, 7:45:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I moved with my girlfriend but if you have questions i might know a few things about it

[19.03.24, 19:05:24] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Chargeblast is connected to nearly all credit card companies, so when a customer calls their credit card company to charge back, we are notified before your processor and provide you 48 hours to address the issue before it ever reaches your processor!
[19.03.24, 19:06:50] ~ L: wow, that's crazy 🤣

Does it work even if they try to chargeback from the bank app?

[23.03.24, 14:46:35] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys, need your help

On for one of our brand

A page that until now had 3.9 min score page

Until one day, a competitor shut down our DMCA page, just because he had registered his trademark.

And since then, every page we've recreated has had a very low page score of 0.8 1.8, even after 1 week of creation.

We're pushing notifications and even so, it's not going back up.

Any ideas?
[23.03.24, 14:49:26] ~ L: Happened to me last month that 1 page got a low feedback score and unable to reinstate - from there any page that I created for that specific store gets a low feedback within a week. 

It was clear to me that facebook was able to understand that the new pages were created to replace the banned one. 

I had to change Profile - BM and create a new page from there . It looks like it's working well
[23.03.24, 14:52:42] ~ Luka: And you had no issues using the same domain / brand as long as it was a new profile & page ?
[23.03.24, 14:56:11] ~ L: Once I decided doing changes in the facebook structure (ie profiles and BM) I also changed the logo in every landing page and also changed images and headlines. Same for domain . I even made new ads on what I've seen working. I wanted to avoid at all costs Facebook recognizing the new page being a replicate of the banned one
[23.03.24, 15:01:45] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: Hey does anyone know of a good video editor that’s looking for work? I need one for fb ads
[23.03.24, 15:15:21] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: New Bm new profil and same domain?
[23.03.24, 15:25:50] ~ L: No, I've changed the domain too
[23.03.24, 20:05:19] ~ Kyle Twohill: Same here

[25.03.24, 17:27:32] ~ Haroon: Impressum is imprint, in Germany you need to have an imprint.
[25.03.24, 17:28:05] ~ Mikael: What kind of imprint? can we not drophsip to germany straight from china?
[25.03.24, 17:28:26] ~ Haroon: And I think ustg 14 is sales tax, because in Germany it’s 19% that you send them invoices and it’s on there
[25.03.24, 17:28:31] ~ Haroon: You can
[25.03.24, 17:28:44] ~ Haroon: But to make it more trustworthy you should have in Germany especially an imprint
[25.03.24, 17:29:02] ~ Haroon: It’s just about where you’re company is located and what kind of company you have
[25.03.24, 17:29:26] ~ Haroon: If you created an llc, you put in that imprint the name and location of it
[25.03.24, 17:29:33] ~ Haroon: If it’s in Germany, people trust it more.
[25.03.24, 17:29:46] ~ Haroon: Company structure in Germany is like GmbH

[26.03.24, 0:46:33] ~ L: Is there a workaround for VAT? 
I’ve left the Europe market because of that
[26.03.24, 1:51:57] ~ Bryan T: My current shipper has a line to the EU where you pay them a premium & can avoid VAT, but that's more of a temporary solution and can't be used at scale, plus you're paying extra anyway
[26.03.24, 7:16:59] ~ Erik Pecovnik: My accountat hands me the bill every 3 months for all the eu countries tax.. RO-19, HU-27, SK-22 …

[28.03.24, 0:36:45] ~ Santiago: Yo, what would you guys say is the best mentor/source to learn abt google ads? Looking to spend 5-6figs per month on that channel and would like to learn about it to a T
[28.03.24, 2:15:04] ~ Rick: Ariane Cyrus
[28.03.24, 8:20:09] ~ Sonu Duhra: Hi, does someone has the notes to the AI Copywriting Training in the ESS?

‎[28.03.24, 16:31:37] ~ L: ‎image omitted
[28.03.24, 16:33:27] ~ Luka: Check for "First Contentful Paint (FCP)". It's a crucial indicator. Basically how long it takes until the first things start loading. This helps the user know stuff is happening and helps reduce the bounce rate
[28.03.24, 16:34:12] ~ Luka: Your LCP looks good though - that should mean your FCP is faster than 1.68
[28.03.24, 16:36:27] ~ L: thank you Luka, yes I believe my FCP isn't bad since the LCP is only 1.68, but I don't understand what to do to improve the other two
[28.03.24, 18:49:09] ~ Sonu Duhra: Does anyone here uses Triple Whale?

The “NOTES” lesson you’ve seen a while ago has been removed since it was outdated
[28.03.24, 20:37:04] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Anyone here selling in Poland?
[28.03.24, 21:02:55] ~ Tiberio: I think Serhii has a brand selling in Poland, he can probably help you with any question
[29.03.24, 0:09:54] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: The HTML files from advertorials from the mastering funnels class how can we use them? Can we just copy the HTML into funnelish and will it copy basically that advertorial?
[29.03.24, 5:27:29] ~ Kyle Twohill: do any of you know of a tool where I can just duplicate a funnel into my funnelsih
[29.03.24, 5:27:38] ~ Kyle Twohill: clone someones template using a tool
[29.03.24, 5:55:01] ~ Imad: Funnelish support team Will do it for you for free if you ask them I think it’s 3 free funnels
[29.03.24, 6:11:16] ~ Kyle Twohill: Oh wow thanks I’ll ask
[29.03.24, 7:06:33] ~ Maxi: hey guys, anyone using backstage.com ?
[29.03.24, 11:21:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys! 

For the beauty niche, selling in the UK, what are the average benchmarks for CPM/CTR/CPC?
[29.03.24, 11:21:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Just so i know what to aim for
[29.03.24, 14:18:56] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: I don’t know specifically but there’s a tool named Varos that will plug into your Fb ads account and compare your numbers to other brands in your niche
[29.03.24, 14:25:45] ~ Andreas Brepohl: Didn’t work in Germany. Use stagepool.com instead
[29.03.24, 14:26:41] ~ Andreas Brepohl: Depends on what you want to get from the data…triple vs first click va last click. Watch that short explainer video in TW
[29.03.24, 14:28:47] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Interesting, thanks!

[29.03.24, 19:23:27] ~ Kyle Twohill: Do any of you send traffic to a funnelish advertorial then do a redirect to shopify product page?
[29.03.24, 19:23:52] ~ Kyle Twohill: or is that a bad idea and I should clone it using gempages on to shopify and do that instead
[29.03.24, 19:24:27] ~ L: I would do this, just to not mess everything up with the pixel
[29.03.24, 20:47:54] ~ Sonu Duhra: I wasted a lot of time with Funnelish, it has so many limitations. I have it all with gem pages within Shopify
[29.03.24, 20:54:30] ~ Bryan T: Anyone have a paypal contact? Keep getting hit with holds ‎<This message was edited>
[29.03.24, 20:54:49] ~ L: I need it too

[29.03.24, 20:55:50] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: I reached out to Mike Ramsey and he’s been super helpful getting holds back

[29.03.24, 21:39:53] ~ Jeeven Nullatamby: ‎~ Clara Busca Sust removed ~ Jeeven Nullatamby
[30.03.24, 14:27:11] ~ Erik Pecovnik: do you get a bill when credit line is being maxed out?
[30.03.24, 14:37:59] ~ Ignasi: You need to anticipate payments to lower the balance.
[30.03.24, 20:06:36] ~ Kyle Twohill: do you guys still see better results with 3 page checkout?
[30.03.24, 20:06:40] ~ Kyle Twohill: on shopify ?
[30.03.24, 23:23:35] ~ Mikael: I'm still using 1 page... I wonder the same. If the 3 page is better or not?
[31.03.24, 6:08:02] ~ Kevin kreative: Anyone has experience with UGC platforms such as insense.pro?
[1.04.24, 11:13:01] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Can anyone help me out with setting Klarna? I have activated it directly on stripe but on shopify is not visible
‎[1.04.24, 11:13:39] ~ Erik Pecovnik: ‎image omitted
[1.04.24, 11:14:11] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: You can have Klarna through stripe on Shopify
[1.04.24, 11:14:15] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Can’t
[1.04.24, 11:14:54] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Klarna through stripe works for Funnelish. Otherwise you need a Klarna Merchant or through Mollie.
[1.04.24, 11:15:05] ~ Erik Pecovnik: thank you!
[1.04.24, 11:18:25] ~ Erik Pecovnik: is there any way to create klarna acc even if its not supported in my country?
[1.04.24, 11:18:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys, how would you go about testing 5 hooks under a new pixel in a 50 mil market? Going straight broad will probably not work so well.
[1.04.24, 11:20:06] ~ Erik Pecovnik: 5 adsets with 5 differents audiences, each with 5 hooks
[1.04.24, 11:20:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: just put 5 creatives under 1 adset?
[1.04.24, 11:20:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: what about budget
[1.04.24, 11:21:04] ~ Jeremy Leppink: with 5 budget should be pretty high then right, normally i would say €10 per variant
[1.04.24, 11:21:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: normally i go max 3 creatives under 1 adset
[1.04.24, 11:21:59] ~ Erik Pecovnik: then do 3 audiences first (which you think will work) and if they dont work create 2 more so you dont spend all the money at once
[1.04.24, 11:22:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: that makes sense
[1.04.24, 11:22:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: thanks
[1.04.24, 11:22:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 3 adsets 50 each
[1.04.24, 11:22:30] ~ Erik Pecovnik: budget should be enough to get 2 purchases per day
[1.04.24, 11:22:45] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I use very low budgets but I have small audiences
[1.04.24, 11:23:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: AVG margin is like 70, target CPA is about 50
[1.04.24, 11:23:15] ~ Erik Pecovnik: then do at least 50 yes
[1.04.24, 11:23:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: allright, thanks!
[1.04.24, 11:23:27] ~ Erik Pecovnik: or
[1.04.24, 11:24:06] ~ Erik Pecovnik: you can also try testing with CBO and let the facebook control which audience will spend the money, but testing is probably better with ABO
[1.04.24, 11:24:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: jeah, normally i move into cbos after at least a 100 conversions
[1.04.24, 11:24:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: product is already proven though, just had to swap pixel
[1.04.24, 11:24:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: thanks, will try it out
[1.04.24, 11:25:20] ~ Maxi: Are you guys using audiences ? 

We only use broad so far ‎<This message was edited>
[1.04.24, 11:25:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: in european markets (except for france and germany) i always use broad
[1.04.24, 11:25:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: right from the start
[1.04.24, 11:25:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: works fine for me
[1.04.24, 11:26:01] ~ Maxi: I never tried audiences
[1.04.24, 11:26:07] ~ Maxi: for us even broad in US works fine
[1.04.24, 11:26:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: on a new pixel?
[1.04.24, 11:30:41] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I use only broad, women and engaged shoppers
[1.04.24, 11:31:29] ~ Erik Pecovnik: you sell with klarna? ‎<This message was edited>
[1.04.24, 11:32:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Yes klarna
[1.04.24, 11:32:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Or at least i did, because of some processing issues not anymore now
[1.04.24, 11:33:24] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Is it supported in your country or you had to find a way to create the acc?
[1.04.24, 11:33:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: its supported
[1.04.24, 11:34:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: on dutch company wasnt a issue for me at all, on my uk company now its a bit more of a hassle but i can still get in with some bought utlilty bills and stuff
[1.04.24, 11:35:36] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Then I will probably have to open another company in austria 😅
[1.04.24, 14:20:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Is it possible that a CC gets flagged on a bm? 

I tried launching a vsl that kept getting rejected on my business partners bm, i tried launching it on mine as i have a stable bm and it got approved pretty quickly.

We now attached his CC to my ad account, relaunched the same VSL and it gets rejected again
[1.04.24, 16:11:23] ~ G M: Of course frequently, create a new card

[7.04.24, 13:52:03] ~ Niels: In our post-purchase flow we stimulate our customers to take a before picture. Then, 2-3 months later, we send another email asking for their before picture which they took plus a picture of the current situation. As an incentive we give them a discount on their next purchase (our product is consumable)
[7.04.24, 13:53:48] ~ Niels: For a new product we start with photoshopped images, midjourney images and/or images from Google/competitors
[7.04.24, 14:46:49] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys, do you see higher cpms with longer form videos (2-6 min) vs short form videos (15-45 seconds)?
[7.04.24, 16:08:18] ~ L: You can make product images with midjourney?😳
[7.04.24, 17:51:47] ~ Niels: I wish 😂 we get before and after images using Midjourney, without the product showing

[8.04.24, 10:31:07] ~ Jeremy Leppink: hmm, they still work for me. I guess its also depending on which market you are selling in
[8.04.24, 10:31:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: like dutch market for 50+, you probably only find like 3-5 people.
[8.04.24, 10:42:21] ~ Daniel: for me backstage was the best, got hundreds of applications with good people & good rates, fiverr they charge too much, and you don’t have a lot to choose from

[9.04.24, 20:15:50] Matán Intsuper: Hi Qi, AE = Account executive? Is it for existing accounts or new accounts only? I've had bad experience with the Stripe Executive contact I got, the only good thing I got from him was the referral to Chargeblast ;)
[9.04.24, 20:17:18] Matán Intsuper: I just want to share my honest experience with Maxwell the Stripe contact, the account he opened for us was immediately flagged as fraud, we sent the docs and he had it reinstated, but since then, our payment decline rate due to radar high risk was 80% decline rate, and he stopped answering our emails. so just heads up.
[9.04.24, 20:17:37] Matán Intsuper: It might work for other people, but for us it didnt, so take it into account when reaching out.
[9.04.24, 20:18:25] Matán Intsuper: And thanks to Chargeblast, we reduced our dispute rate from 1% to 0.14%, so one of the best investments we've ever made for our business, 100% recommended.
[9.04.24, 20:43:45] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Yes AE = Account Executive; we have a few who could be more helpful!
[9.04.24, 20:44:04] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Glad to hear it helped!

[11.04.24, 1:38:48] ~ Malik: So I don't see how can I moderate the comments ? I only see those from Facebook
[11.04.24, 1:39:09] ~ Malik: Is there anything I can do ? Thank you
[11.04.24, 1:50:24] ~ Peter: No need to worry about comments at all

[11.04.24, 2:11:51] ~ L: Why not ?
[11.04.24, 2:13:11] ~ Peter: I’ve never seen any difference in performance between monitoring them and not doing anything
[11.04.24, 2:14:44] ~ Peter: Almost everyone that sees the ad just either clicks the link or continues scrolling
[11.04.24, 2:15:10] ~ Peter: Hardly anyone actually starts digging into the comment section
[11.04.24, 2:15:43] ~ Peter: No ctr change no cvr change or nothing
[11.04.24, 2:16:13] ~ Peter: And nobody I’ve ever spoken to  could ever ever
[11.04.24, 2:22:37] ~ Santi Roa: How much are you spending on Meta per day?
[11.04.24, 2:23:38] ~ Peter: Been in the game for 4 years now and I’ve spent as much as 2k per day consistently
[11.04.24, 2:23:44] ~ Peter: Never seen any difference
[11.04.24, 2:24:16] ~ Peter: And I personally don’t know anyone that’s doing well that’s ever doing anything about the comments
[11.04.24, 2:34:42] ~ Harout: I think a lot of people actually read the comments before buying and its not much effort moderating comments with FB's autohide feature and a VA responding to all comments. Maybe not worth at small scale but at scale Id definitely have that handled
[11.04.24, 2:52:37] ~ Peter: Fb autohide is easily implemented from there but after that I’d only invest into responding to comments as a brand owner not dropshipper
[11.04.24, 2:52:56] ~ Peter: I’m talking dropshipping here btw
[11.04.24, 3:39:15] ~ Santi Roa: So you're leaving a lot of opportunity on the table
[11.04.24, 3:39:29] ~ Santi Roa: Oh yeah then it makes more sense
[11.04.24, 3:40:15] ~ Santi Roa: We split tested replying to comments and not doing it. 
It impacts the CPM at first, then it stabilizes closer and doesn't seem to have a long term corelation.

But it definitely lift conversions up
[11.04.24, 3:41:08] ~ Santi Roa: We are a brand though. Spending 10k day now in Q1 but about 70k/day in Q4.
Getting thousands of comments but when you engage with people there somehow performance goes up
[11.04.24, 3:41:59] ~ Santi Roa: We've seen some huge performance spikes when people fight in the comment section. Also, when there's a controversial topic
[11.04.24, 3:46:28] ~ Imad: https://youtube.com/shorts/GJ9NFAAHUwk?feature=shared
[11.04.24, 7:19:06] ~ Sonu Duhra: Our VA checks all the comments and DM’s within Meta Business Suit, from Facebook and Instagram. Maybe try that. Definitely worth to engage with people. Also you get more comments count when you reply

[11.04.24, 12:04:08] ~ Sonu Duhra: I have checked for our third party pages, they also don't have a IG account, the comments won't show in Meta Suite, but you can connect it with "fake" IG account, then you will be able to moderate those comments
[11.04.24, 12:05:00] ~ Sonu Duhra: not 100% sure but worth the try

[11.04.24, 12:17:44] ~ Yusuf Business: On ads manager when you edit ad, click three dots at the top right, click more options, then click manage IG comments, that way you should be able to manage without having ig page
[11.04.24, 13:35:59] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey Guys, how much is fees with Shopify payment US?

I actual have Swiss Shopify Payments and pays 5,5% fees for sell to US,

What is the most and quick way to switch to an US Shopify payments?
[11.04.24, 14:17:15] ~ Yusuf Business: Shopify charges extra 2% for international orders if you collect money in other currencies

I think setting up with USD as a main currency should fix it. If Shopify has different rates for Swiss business and US business, only way to solve it is operating with US based company imo

Or you can try changing your billing address and business address on shopify to US address, then you’ll probably need to use Shopify US
[11.04.24, 14:22:59] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We have already US as Main currency 

Is not risky to change to US adress?
[11.04.24, 14:37:05] ~ Yusuf Business: Yes, it could be risky, I always had the same address on shopify settings and payment settings.

In my opinion, safest way would be operating with US company but it will take time and money

[11.04.24, 15:28:51] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): I can get you set up with a Stripe account with protection from a Stripe account executive if you’d like. Shop Pay is harder because they don’t have any way of connecting you with folks that can help you through the process.

[11.04.24, 22:59:39] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Advantage + with 2 or 3 ads for each product targeted to the US is working super well for us. I’ve heard this is the same for Europe. We’ve got 3 products
[11.04.24, 23:00:25] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Much better than ABO. No targeting, just open it up and let the AI do the heavy lifting. Note that I am using ads that have been performing alrwdy
[11.04.24, 23:02:19] ~ Malik: Did you first test the ads in an ABO/CBO campaign or do you directly test in ASC+ ?
[11.04.24, 23:02:23] ~ Malik: Oh ok they were already running
[11.04.24, 23:02:58] ~ L: If I may ask, what's your process for optimizing the Advantage +? Do you adjust the budget on bad and good days like a CBO? Do you turn off creatives that don't bring sales? ‎<This message was edited>
[11.04.24, 23:22:19] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Turn off creatives that have a CPA that is too high
[11.04.24, 23:23:14] ~ Benjamin Walsh: After good days adjust budget 100 to 200 to 500 to 1000 etc I wait after 3 days of good roas / cpa
[11.04.24, 23:23:48] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Sub out bad creatives and load in new ones. Pull them when they stop performing
[11.04.24, 23:25:13] ~ L: Great, will schedule one for tomorrow and see how it performs, never actually tested A+ 

thank you very much
[11.04.24, 23:26:10] ~ L: You still wait 3 days when first launching before taking any decision? Or it takes longer to optimize?
[12.04.24, 0:01:36] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Well if it’s spent $150 - $300 with no sales I would deem it to not be working well for us
[12.04.24, 0:02:06] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Yes I wait 3 days before taking any action. I believe best practice is to wait longer but I can’t help myself
[12.04.24, 0:03:48] ~ Benjamin Walsh: I’m also reusing post ID’s from ads that have been working in my other campaigns, so it may be you need to re launch with better ads if it isn’t getting sales you are looking for

We currently ship our product in a nice branded box from iPhone cardboard that our customers love. But it’s cutting in our margins.

We could also use a cardboard envelope/padded mailer since we ship a small product that fits through the mailbox. 

We ship from China. Which option would you pick, and why?
[12.04.24, 12:33:39] China Bigboss: Hey there are thousands of other options you can choose from I guess to reduce the size of the box might be a good idea if it can help or get the new eco friendly packing as well people start like it

And the MOF, i made a custom list of viewed website, interacted with my fb and instagram page, 180 days, and put them all in a cbo campaign, 1 ad set, and i only have 1 carousel, but you can add more stuff, like the videos that work well in your TOF, this one’s running at $20 a day, you can ramp it up if it’s doing that good and if you have a lot of traffic

[12.04.24, 23:29:12] Bob: My ads manager shows my Facebook business manager has been restricted, but in the business settings it shows that everything is fine with my account. Has anyone seen this before?
[13.04.24, 8:59:56] ~ Sonu Duhra: Maybe one of your accounts has been restricted. Happens to me sometimes, the all I have to do is to verify my credit card details and that it’s, and it’s does not effect my ads, just the access to it ‎<This message was edited>

[13.04.24, 11:27:29] Bob: Yeah that’s what I thought as well, but no where it shows that I can ask for a review
[13.04.24, 12:03:52] ~ Mikael: Have you spoken to FB support?
[13.04.24, 12:07:47] Bob: Yes. They say it is because of a restriction I got more then a year ago and that I should talk to my meta marketing pro because they have more things they can do about it
[13.04.24, 12:08:04] ~ G M: Guys if you have 2+ PayPal accounts is it possible to have the same phone number but different emails?
[13.04.24, 12:08:28] Bob: Have spoken to several, and they say the message I get in the ad account is because of my personal account, but in the business settings it says my personal account is okay to advertise with.
[13.04.24, 13:01:35] ~ Harout: in our experience Paypal knows both are yours and they dont care as long as you have healthy business practices (adding tracking no.s, low dispute rate, long acc. history etc)

[13.04.24, 15:28:47] ~ Sang: CPM is crazy cheap
[13.04.24, 17:07:11] Radek: Depends on your strategy and values - have long term vision with this product, or brand in general - go for better packaging. If you care about cashflow and have only short term vision with this product - go for cheaper packaging, and maximise front end profit.

Customer research can be a b*tch but your ads won't land if you don't know who you should be speaking to. 

My lastest ChatGPT creation allows you to build a fully interactive ideal customer profile you can talk to and ask your marketing questions to. 

Here is the link for ESS members so you can test drive it for yourself. 

It will talk you through each step of the process.

[17.04.24, 15:27:01] ~ Malik: April has been slower than march for me and some other friends
[17.04.24, 15:27:01] ~ Alessandro Sassi: worst month ever for me

[17.04.24, 15:30:10] ~ RS: For me march was very slow comparing to previous months. The first week of april was good, it seemed like everything was improving but then in the second week the performance dropped again and I cannot get it stable anymore too. Scaled down my adspend by 2.5 times comparing to previous months and now cannot get my adspend back to previous levels while staying profitable. Very strange

[17.04.24, 20:10:29] ~ Maxi: You reset the budget at the end of the day ?

[17.04.24, 20:16:31] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: And you are seeing no drop in performance with these increases?
[17.04.24, 20:16:37] ~ Santiago: But the reset depends on how much I’ve scales each ad set
[17.04.24, 20:17:08] ~ Santiago: Yea of course there’s gonna be ad sets or CBOs that are going to flop when you increase budget
[17.04.24, 20:17:35] ~ Santiago: Usually it gets back to normal when you decrease ad spend
[17.04.24, 20:17:50] ~ Santiago: But if it radically drop i suggest just shutting it down ‎<This message was edited>
[17.04.24, 20:18:34] ~ Firass: shutting down the ad set or the entire campaign?
[17.04.24, 20:19:29] ~ Firass: we usually just decrease spend and wait for the campaign to stabilize again
[17.04.24, 20:19:44] ~ Santiago: Yea exactly
[17.04.24, 20:19:57] ~ Santiago: Depends cause i surf both ABOs and CBOs
[17.04.24, 20:20:03] ~ Santiago: At the same time
[17.04.24, 20:20:11] ~ Firass: on the same ad account?
[17.04.24, 20:20:29] ~ Santiago: Yea
[17.04.24, 20:20:44] ~ Santiago: Obviously there’s gonna be ad accs
[17.04.24, 20:20:50] ~ Santiago: That perform better
[17.04.24, 20:20:53] ~ Santiago: With one or another
[17.04.24, 20:21:00] ~ Firass: fair enough
[17.04.24, 20:21:03] ~ Santiago: But i just simply test both approaches in each ad acc
[17.04.24, 20:22:09] ~ RS: What is your typical starting budget of these campaigns? And does it usually spend all the budget that day to the budget you increased? I have noticed that if cbo budget is 300$, I scale it to 400$ during that day, then again to 500$, but it maybe spends only 350$
[17.04.24, 20:24:15] ~ Santiago: Usually it doesn’t spend the entire budget the increase in ad spend is just for the sake of pushing Facebook to accelerate our impressions
[17.04.24, 20:24:36] ~ Santiago: I start with ad ser budget as low as $50 and CBO budget as low as $200
[17.04.24, 20:24:51] ~ Santiago: The i just go complete chad mode

[17.04.24, 20:35:49] ~ Santiago: 3
[17.04.24, 20:43:00] ~ RS: And for the CBO’s that you surf-scale, how many adsets do you usually have in these CBO’s?
[17.04.24, 20:45:02] ~ Santiago: 5
[17.04.24, 20:47:32] ~ Santiago: If a cbo is getting a good roas the you duplicate it
[17.04.24, 20:47:57] ~ Santiago: For a good scale aim for at least 20 CBOs running on surf scale
[17.04.24, 20:48:30] ~ RS: Oh that sounds fun😀
[17.04.24, 20:48:33] ~ Santiago: I’ve encountered diminishing returns when increasing a CBO past 10k day
[17.04.24, 20:48:41] ~ Santiago: So i just leave jr there
[17.04.24, 20:49:04] ~ Santiago: But not sure if anyone else has had a different experience ‎<This message was edited>
[17.04.24, 22:10:52] ~ Santi Roa: We use a similar approach to Media Buying but simplified. We scale shit under a few campaigns. Usually having one scaling campaign
[17.04.24, 22:11:31] ~ Santi Roa: In Q4 we surfed and duplicated a shit ton of things, often going from 40k/day (in spent) to 70k and then reducing
[17.04.24, 22:11:59] ~ Santi Roa: So basically we had planned and scheduled 30k with the idea of getting it to 40k. But when the results were good we just surfed more
[17.04.24, 22:12:52] ~ Santi Roa: I mean, I didn't do shit but that's what I saw my team doing. They were having a lot of fun as you said hahaha

Before every surfing (each hour) they would do 10 pushups to keep the energy flowing.

[18.04.24, 9:01:17] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys, do you know if it is possible to have multi-currency checkout with Stripe on Shopify? I need to update the billing info for my company but Shopify Payments will become unavailable
[18.04.24, 9:02:30] ~ Rick: Anybody has a good contact for Currenxie ? 🙏🙏
[18.04.24, 9:02:38] ~ Firass: Unfortunately it wont work with Stripe. You can have a currency converter on your store but the customer will still checkout with the default store currency
[18.04.24, 9:04:05] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Damn that's a big issue... So they won't be able to see their local currency at checkout? wont' this hurt CR?
[18.04.24, 9:04:10] ~ Firass: I have tried both (shopify payments and stripe) and to be honest the performance was not really that significantly better with shopify payments. I just used USD as my store currency and we have customers from Australia and UK that dont bother paying in USD
[18.04.24, 9:25:30] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Can I dm you?
[18.04.24, 9:25:52] ~ Firass: of course
[18.04.24, 11:57:05] ~ Santi Roa: We do it for diversification, and also because some people say fb optimizes by ad account. We also use it to test different stuff and make sure it doesn't impact our main spend
[18.04.24, 11:57:18] ~ Santi Roa: Everything to one shop/domain in our case

[18.04.24, 12:59:28] ~ Santi Roa: Sometimes we test new pixels just to see how it impacts
[18.04.24, 12:59:59] ~ Maxi: Is there a difference ?
[18.04.24, 13:00:34] ~ Santi Roa: Yes, but we've been selling the same product for 2 years
[18.04.24, 13:01:01] ~ Santi Roa: So we do it just to make facebook optimize again from scratch and maybe find some new pockets
[18.04.24, 13:01:52] ~ Santi Roa: But it's not a huge hack... is just something we test a few times per year to see what happens

[20.04.24, 20:02:36] ‪+30 697 785 4474‬: my HK paypal got banned, that's the crazy part
[20.04.24, 20:48:44] ~ L: For those who opened a company in Hong Kong, is having a nominee beneficial, irrelevant, or problematic when it comes to PayPal?
[20.04.24, 20:59:19] ~ Rick: No
[20.04.24, 20:59:35] ~ Rick: If the nominee has clear pp account it works
[20.04.24, 20:59:52] ~ Rick: But Singapore PAypals are best
[20.04.24, 21:00:57] ~ Rick: I wouldn’t set a Hong Kong PayPal on your own name
[20.04.24, 21:01:06] ~ L: So when Paypal asks for documents, I will have to provide the nominee documents?
[20.04.24, 21:01:42] ~ Rick: From the one who owns the pp account
[20.04.24, 21:02:00] ~ Rick: Nominee is only so you are in safe side
[20.04.24, 21:02:24] ~ Rick: But if you make a PayPal in Singapore even better. They never ask documents
[20.04.24, 21:02:32] ~ Rick: I use it for dropshipping aswell
[20.04.24, 21:02:59] ~ Rick: With Currenxie you can send it from Hongkong to Singapore
[20.04.24, 21:03:46] ~ G M: Which banks do you use for Singapore?
[20.04.24, 21:04:07] ~ Rick: You can use multiple doesn’t really matter
[20.04.24, 21:04:16] ~ Rick: Because you need Singapore company
[20.04.24, 21:04:22] ~ Rick: To create the PP
[20.04.24, 21:04:33] ~ Rick: But it’s better then Hongkong PAyPals
[20.04.24, 21:05:07] ~ G M: Do you use currenxie with Singapore?
[20.04.24, 21:05:38] ~ Rick: Yes from Currenxie you can send it from Hongkong to your Singapore paypal
[21.04.24, 1:39:52] ‪+358 44 2435212‬: How can I contact facebook business support directly? I have an unorthodox request for them and would like to speak to a real person.
[21.04.24, 2:09:09] ~ Lachy Waldon: anyone got a funnelish template for checkout which looks pretty identical to shopify
[21.04.24, 12:20:59] ~ Sang: recorvery 50% off your abanded card using this app https://apps.shopify.com/sms-marketing-abandoned-cart
[21.04.24, 12:21:17] ~ Sang: it sends sms to all customer even without subscribing
[21.04.24, 17:51:21] ‪+358 44 2435212‬: If I have an old facebook business manager that has experienced a few bans in the past, is it okay to use from now on or can it worsen ad performance?
[21.04.24, 18:08:39] ~ Chris Koh: What do you mean by identical to shopify?
[21.04.24, 18:39:14] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Guys I’m having problems on funnelish with getting the payment form element to be in the right position in both mobile and desktop does somebody know how I can place it in different locations for the different versions?
[21.04.24, 18:39:57] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Because if I try to duplicate it and hide it then it won’t work for one of the two versions
[21.04.24, 18:40:03] ~ Nicco: thank you man, i appreciate it
[21.04.24, 19:30:11] ~ Y: You can’t have two payment form elements in the same page as that is not supported by most payment methods, you can hide/show elemts around a payment form, or set margins that work for all devices, or adjust margins using css if necessary.
[21.04.24, 19:55:33] ~ Sonu Duhra: Guys, Multi-Advertiser Ads, yes or no?
[22.04.24, 15:09:10] ~ Luka: What's the solution when a campaign suddenly stops spending? Other campaigns are fine, but 2 main ones are not spending even a penny. I tried disabling/enabling the campaign, adset and ads but no luck
[22.04.24, 16:10:22] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: @⁨~Santi Roa⁩ hey bro can I can duplicate your sheets?
[22.04.24, 16:53:25] ~ Santi Roa: Hey, yeah I think you can just copy and paste it no problem. if you find any new thing to add to the system please let me know so we keep paying it forward for others who might need it

[23.04.24, 12:01:39] Topi: Hello, anyone using northbeam?
[23.04.24, 12:06:49] ~ Marin: I am for a few clients
[23.04.24, 12:13:11] ~ lengjoo: does it work well with funnelish?
[23.04.24, 12:14:25] ~ Marin: Don't know, don't have any clients on funnelish with NB but you can ask NB about it
[23.04.24, 12:36:50] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Sur I will check with my new VA, because last one have DMCA our Facebook back up page severals times 😭
[23.04.24, 13:28:52] ~ Maxi: Guys has anyone tested adcreative.ai ?
[23.04.24, 13:29:59] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: I tried, thought it was awful.
[23.04.24, 13:42:26] ~ Kevin Krieg: Definitely dogshit, at least for us. Nowhere near where it needs to be to work well, at least for ecom imo.
[23.04.24, 13:42:45] ~ Kevin Krieg: I think it can work well if you are for examplr a local service provider or agency
[23.04.24, 13:43:01] ~ Kevin Krieg: I feel lile their ai is more tailored to service based
[23.04.24, 13:43:04] ~ Kevin Krieg: Than to ecom
[23.04.24, 13:43:40] ~ Luka: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/adcreative.ai
[23.04.24, 13:43:51] ~ Luka: lots of sketchy reviews, they might be buying a lot of the 5 star ones as they're just "1 review" accouints
[23.04.24, 13:44:03] ~ Luka: Always heard negative things about them from other stoo
[23.04.24, 13:45:37] ~ Maxi: Well then I won’t even try
[23.04.24, 13:50:46] ~ Firass: try out photoai.com as from what I have tested now is pretty solid. The AI results will need a small learning  phase in the beginning by optimizing your prompts but so far it really is good value for the credits you get for the starting plan ‎<This message was edited>
[23.04.24, 13:51:55] ~ Firass: it will be tricky for some products though so not every product will get you good results but for the majority of cases it does the job
[23.04.24, 14:50:35] ~ Mukhtar: Guys, what software do you use for tracking data on Funnelish? Fb Ad account is showing incorrect data, especially CPA.
[23.04.24, 14:51:06] ~ Mukhtar: It counts upsells as 2 purchase
[23.04.24, 16:04:20] ~ Nikhil: ‎~ Clara Busca Sust added ~ Nikhil
[23.04.24, 16:32:56] ‪+30 697 785 4474‬: it over reports for sure. Richie suggested to adjust the BEROAS 80-100% higher because of that. I use TW as well and there I see it under reporting
[24.04.24, 1:23:56] ~ Mike Ramsey: I know Northbeam well - actually hosted a dinner with them at my prior company.  Good team there.
[24.04.24, 2:34:58] Yaniv: Whats the benefit of using it?
[24.04.24, 11:28:30] ~ seth: hi anyone selling in Mexico? what shipping line do you use?
[24.04.24, 12:25:38] ~ Ignasi: Guys - what’s you recommendation for an SEO app for Shopify? I have markets and translate and adapt enabled
[24.04.24, 13:27:02] ~ Sonu Duhra: Is translate and adapt better then Weglot?
[24.04.24, 13:35:20] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys, anyone switched from Shopify to Woocommerce here?
[24.04.24, 15:43:08] ~ Luka: Yep we did
[24.04.24, 16:43:20] ~ Ignasi: It’s a bit better for AB testing stuff
[24.04.24, 17:08:08] ~ Sonu Duhra: We use Weglot, it’s so complicated, we had so many customisations done before we could use it properly.   Is this app easier to use and does it has all functions like Weglot?
[24.04.24, 17:22:16] ~ Eric R: Anyone have a reliable Trustpilot solution/service to increase score?
[24.04.24, 17:30:19] ~ Ignasi: I’ts built in into shopify. It will translate shopify stuff but will not be supported by most apps. I think it’s hard to do this well. The one I’ve been exploring but haven’t tried yet is phrase.com
[24.04.24, 17:44:22] Topi: Yes dm
[24.04.24, 17:47:08] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes me too our score sucks
[24.04.24, 21:33:02] ~ Sonu Duhra: For a new product with zero pixel data, would it be advisable to test directly in the US or would it first be better to test in smaller market? ‎<This message was edited>
[24.04.24, 23:23:12] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Has anyone tried website and shop instead of only website? Do they work? I’ve tried them a few times but the CTR seems off, i use the unique outbound ctr metric to determine if my ads are good, but with Website and Shop, the ctr is always bad

I tested using the same ads with the website conversion only and the ctr is above 1% 🤔

I ask because facebook keeps recommending me in my campaigns to switch all my campaigns to Website and Shop 😅
[25.04.24, 5:53:18] ~ Lachy Waldon: have never used funnelish checkout
because i’ve always struggled to get my CVR high on it. Any specific CVR booters anyone would recommend?

My shopify had a 6% CVR and funnelish i struggle to keep above 2%
[25.04.24, 7:42:45] ~ Y: Have you tried replicating similar checkout experience to your shopify? like this one: https://app.funnelish.com/share?funnel=43318&code=SHARE-bjqVNDkZVc
[25.04.24, 9:57:09] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team won’t be able to join tomorrows call, at the Hormozi workshop. If you have any questions or need any feedback hit me up directly here on WhatsApp
[25.04.24, 10:15:50] ~ Sonu Duhra: people use too much images, texts and badges in funnelish checkout, which just look scammy to me, I would never buy from such checkouts. Should be lean and high quality images/icons like svg format
[25.04.24, 10:22:14] ~ Luka: Try simplifying the checkout. Most consumers have experience with the Shopify checkout, so something similar can outperform a checkout that looks very different. Worth split testing
[25.04.24, 10:44:08] ~ Maxi: It depends on your audience and the traffic imo 

For native traffic or direct response you definetly want those „ugly“ badges etc.
[25.04.24, 12:42:21] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Has anyone here been shut down by Klarna Merchant Before? and what did you do?

They have terminated all contracts with my Company for an honest mistake. They wanted me to fix the orders getting activated right away after purchase to be activated when fulfilled. I didnt know how to fix this until a few weeks later. When I did my supplier didnt get the orders in their system leading to 2 weeks of orders not getting fulfilled. So now they have terminated all contracts and wont let me work with them.

So Im basically without Klarna atm, which is crucial for my business. Do I just start a new LLC?😅
[25.04.24, 13:27:49] ~ RS: Hey! Do you know what are the benefits of registering company for ecom stores in Gibraltar?
[25.04.24, 14:08:36] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Personal taxes are low across the board, with an effective rate of income tax of only 25% (26% for a period of one year from 1 July 2023 as a response to Covid expenditures) on all incomes up to £500,000. All companies in Gibraltar pay only 12.5% tax on profits.
[25.04.24, 14:08:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Tax haven
[25.04.24, 14:08:47] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Not the best, but definetly low
[25.04.24, 15:53:42] ~ Mikael: Our Klarna Payments were disabled yesterday on Shopify Payments without any reason given. Shopify support doesnt help much yet.. Have anyone else had this experience?
[25.04.24, 16:00:21] ~ Maxi: I have a Gibraltar LTD it’s perfect
[25.04.24, 16:03:35] ~ Maxi: It’s 0% on everything if:

-You are non Gibraltar resident 
-income is not from business made in Gibraltar actively 

@⁨~RS⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[25.04.24, 16:05:20] ~ Maxi: If you combine that with a UAE Residence, you are zeroing out your personal income tax aswell
[25.04.24, 16:07:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: How was setting up processing for you, does Gibraltar have good options? Or are you only working with MoR
[25.04.24, 16:07:40] ~ Maxi: MoR, Stripe also works in Gib
[25.04.24, 16:08:10] ~ Maxi: You can make a holding, open up US LLC owned by Gib. LTD and have US Stripe and processing aswell
[25.04.24, 16:08:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: interesting
[25.04.24, 16:09:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thanks
[25.04.24, 16:09:12] ~ Maxi: Sure 👍🏻
[25.04.24, 17:00:44] ~ Sonu Duhra: you get Stripe UK with this setup?
[25.04.24, 17:42:59] ~ Mohammed-amine: ‎~ Clara Busca Sust removed ~ Mohammed-amine
[25.04.24, 19:07:12] ~ Maxi: No you actually get Gibraltar stripe, yes it’s a thing lol
‎[25.04.24, 21:42:57] ~ Adonis A: ‎image omitted
[25.04.24, 21:43:31] ~ Adonis A: Has anyone here had a store suspended after a DMCA? Anyway to get it back? We see a counter notice appeal but that’s it
[26.04.24, 3:08:20] ~ Wouter Akika: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ Wouter Akika
[26.04.24, 3:11:19] Alex  Fedotoff: Team! @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩ is a legendary entrepreneur and is looking for help
With The feedback score on how fb page. His delivery times are fast but the fb score is still low . Please share the solutions you used / know for this
[26.04.24, 3:15:00] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey Alex, appreciate the outreach. Basically over the last 4 weeks we have been seeing the score decline and we have no outside factors pointing towards negative customer feedback or sentiment, the contrary. Wondering if anyone has some social engineering / technical solutions in place to keep that above a 4+ as we believe this gives us the best traffic on the fb channel! Any ideas?
[26.04.24, 3:16:49] ~ Nils: Just had a thought
[26.04.24, 3:17:08] ~ Nils: Could there be competitors giving lots of bad feedback on your ads?
[26.04.24, 3:17:54] ~ Wouter Akika: 100% Possible, how would you check such a thing though?
[26.04.24, 3:21:40] ~ Nils: Yeah you’re right, dont think its possible but could be wrong
[26.04.24, 3:23:10] ~ Yusuf: i guess buying feedbacks didn't work for you then, i'm still using Zefi agency for it and found them in ESS
[26.04.24, 3:38:48] ~ Wouter Akika: @⁨~Yusuf⁩ Got it, dm'ed you! Anything outside of buying FB that you do to incentivize / influence the score?
[26.04.24, 3:44:19] ~ Yusuf: unless competitors are ruining the feedback i think the most solid solution is improving customer experience

when i had low feedback score, i wanted someone from my team to analyze 200+ past emails, find the negative ones, categorizing them to understand the common reasons behind and trying to come up with solutions. Also I send them survey after 4-8 weeks, make them rate the same topics that facebook asks and ask them how we can improve

i give discount when they complete survey

you can check if survey results match with fb feedback score results
[26.04.24, 3:45:27] ~ Wouter Akika: Thank you @⁨~Yusuf⁩ !!
[26.04.24, 3:47:03] ~ Wouter Akika: Will put that in place aswell to match the same questions in a survey ourselves so we can see what the delta is ‎<This message was edited>
[26.04.24, 11:39:28] ~ Sang: they use comment for scoring also, simple way my team is using is send an email to delivered customers, ask them like product or not, if yes => redirect to facebook post or trustpilot ‎<This message was edited>
[26.04.24, 11:39:53] ~ Sang: if no show them the google doc form lol
[26.04.24, 12:07:32] ~ Yusuf Business: guys i have quick question. It’s possible to keep the engagement on fb on different ads by using existing post but on ig, it always appears as new post even though I use ‘existing post’

In the past it was not like this, engagement was protected on ig too

Is there any way to keep the engagement on the same video on different ads on IG?
[26.04.24, 12:11:44] ~ Mikael: Anyone who has a good solution for Klarna payment processor?
[26.04.24, 14:04:34] ~ Mikael: Anyone who knows a good solution like getting a UK company for klarna in eu?
[26.04.24, 14:21:48] ~ Jeremy Leppink: This works
[26.04.24, 14:21:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You can get Klarna om UK
[26.04.24, 14:22:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: If you are banned, let your business partner set it up and open Klarna on his name
‎[26.04.24, 14:32:26] ~ Sonu Duhra: ‎image omitted
[26.04.24, 14:33:06] ~ Sonu Duhra: don't know if anyone noticed, but you can now choose within the Shopify checkout. Which works better for you guys?
[26.04.24, 14:33:33] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I tested both multiple times, i dont see a lot of difference tbh, i would say one checkout has a slightly better CVR
[26.04.24, 14:33:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Might be because they dont have to go through 3 pages (loading time) so bounce rate is slightly lower
[26.04.24, 14:34:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But i see no big difference at all
[26.04.24, 15:04:39] ~ Yusuf Business: Which SMS app do you prefer? For now, my priority is just abandoned checkouts, so looking for something cheaper but useful
[26.04.24, 15:29:44] ~ Alex: @⁨~Yusuf Business⁩ This is great
‎[26.04.24, 15:33:45] ~ Sang: ‎image omitted
[26.04.24, 15:36:35] ~ RS: Your ad performance is getting better comparing to march?
[26.04.24, 15:38:03] ~ Maxi: People selling in the Netherlands via funnelish, are upsells possible with ideal & bancontact
[26.04.24, 15:57:11] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Upsells no
[26.04.24, 15:57:26] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Or, they are, but you have like 5 day unfulfilled status
[26.04.24, 15:57:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: and it will mess up a lot
[26.04.24, 15:58:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I think you cant even see if they actually payed the upsell, as on stripe it will say "processing" for 5 days, only after 5 days you can see if they actually bought
[26.04.24, 16:12:48] ~ Yusuf Business: thanks! I missed that one
[26.04.24, 16:34:57] ~ Luka: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/yotpo.com
[26.04.24, 16:35:48] ~ Luka: Anyone know what's going on Yotpo? Customer support is horrible. Been trying to get them to update my billing as it's broken, and every time we start the process/support ticket, they just stop responding half way. This has been going on for weeks now
[26.04.24, 16:35:55] ~ Luka: Seems like others are experiencing the same thing
[26.04.24, 17:25:22] ~ Santi Roa: Hey guys! I've been using a freelancer to run my entire amazon channel. He always had employees and a decent team. Now he has some availability to take 1 new client, if you're interested DM me I'll share his info.

He worked in Thrasio ( Biggest Amazon Aggregator ) for about 3 years and managed there like 15 brands with ( Angry Oranges, Rymora and Dermora) and others.  He is a genius of amazon brand management /supply chain/logistics/ etc
[26.04.24, 17:49:10] ~ Joshua: anybody have a good way to get a suppliers phone number from AliExpress? the store is just random numbers, so no way to look them up… if I message them anything about WhatsApp, AliExpress blocks the message.

[27.04.24, 13:18:32] ~ RS: Have anybody tried to use new pixel after bad FB ads period this year? If so, did it improve performance?
[27.04.24, 14:19:45] ~ Luka: Anyone in Guangzhou? Was just about to fly in a few days but the weather looks crazy… floods and apparently cancelled flights
[27.04.24, 15:29:47] ~ Sonu Duhra: some use new ad accounts with same pixel
[27.04.24, 15:30:22] ~ Sonu Duhra: anybody tried scalersmethod from Alex Micol?
[27.04.24, 15:30:23] ~ RS: So switching ad accounts actually helped to improve performance ?
[27.04.24, 15:31:15] ~ Sonu Duhra: i think you should ask @⁨~Santiago⁩ about this
[27.04.24, 15:53:34] ~ Harout: yeah it didnt really help. I agree using new ad account might help but again low likelyhood
[27.04.24, 16:20:50] ~ Yusuf: i tried it recently for two brands, results were worse, now i stopped extra ad accounts
[27.04.24, 17:55:24] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, Whats the most trusted and used payment methods in UK and Germany?
[27.04.24, 18:05:31] ~ Mikael: Also btw, My google dude who is professional as fck are looking for more clients to fill up. as Klarna cut us out, our sales died. so he is looking for more work. VERY skilled.
[27.04.24, 21:39:00] ~ Mukhtar: Hey guys,
We're managing over 20 UGC creators and actors every day and it’s getting tough to keep track of everyone. 

How do you all manage this? Is there a system or tool you recommend for tracking their progress?
[27.04.24, 21:39:26] ~ Wouter Akika: ClickUp?
[27.04.24, 21:43:33] ~ Mukhtar: Yeah, never used it. But I am going to now. Thanks, man!
[27.04.24, 23:57:12] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): If anyone has suppliers from Guangzhou for drop shipping, should def check in to see if there are delays and let customers know to protect against chargebacks a bit! We had this happen to one of our clients before he was on Chargeblast and delays resulted in a spike in chargebacks and kicked off of Shopify Pay

[28.04.24, 13:02:42] ~ Mukhtar: Can you integrate it with funnelish?
[28.04.24, 13:35:35] ~ Anvar: Who here has a plug with unlimited BMs? 2 of my suppliers ran out of them
[28.04.24, 17:31:49] ~ Mikael: When scaling out to other countrys, Do you guys recommend to use the same pixel or other pixel?

[28.04.24, 20:09:20] ~ Mukhtar: Guys, 
What are the Top 3 skills and responsibilities for a creative strategist?
[28.04.24, 20:09:49] ~ Mukhtar: I’d like to know your opinions
[28.04.24, 21:13:33] ~ Nils: Idea creation / creative thinking
Copywriting
Analytic

These skills/traits I believe are important
[28.04.24, 21:13:58] ~ Nils: Favorite low tax business and personal income countries?
[29.04.24, 11:40:06] ~ Niels: For the guys running on WooCommerce, what tracking solution would you recommend?
[29.04.24, 12:24:33] ~ RS: Are geo funnels working for you today in funnelish? Mine don’t work, just shows main funnel. Sales are down a lot because of this funnelish bug, so check your funnels
[29.04.24, 12:28:07] ~ RS: Just checked my geo funnels from all my target countries - shows only the main funnel. @⁨~Y⁩
[29.04.24, 12:49:11] ~ Maxi: Apparently some issues today with funnelish
[29.04.24, 12:49:17] ~ Maxi: Multiple people saying no sales again 😂
[29.04.24, 12:49:31] ~ RS: How its for u? Geo funnels working for you?
[29.04.24, 12:50:38] ~ RS: Their support does not respond. Maybe they are trying to fix something
[29.04.24, 12:50:43] ~ Maxi: Nothing works
[29.04.24, 12:50:50] ~ Maxi: No sales from any GEO funnels
[29.04.24, 12:50:52] ~ Maxi: Only main
[29.04.24, 12:51:10] ~ RS: Yep, same for me.
[29.04.24, 13:06:59] ~ Y: I think we might have triggered a bug with geo-funnels, it’s cleared now, pls let me know or tag me if still facing any issues
[29.04.24, 13:07:36] ~ RS: Checking now
[29.04.24, 13:11:19] ~ RS: Yes its working now
[29.04.24, 13:11:28] ~ Nicco: 6 hours without any sales
[29.04.24, 13:51:49] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Anyone selling in Italy without COD?
[29.04.24, 13:52:23] ~ Ignasi: Me
[29.04.24, 13:56:24] René Crooijmans: Me too
[29.04.24, 15:06:35] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes good cvr but the shipping curriers in Italy suck! I think they don’t have great shipping infrastructure like in Germany on UK. They just send it back to you, without trying to deliver
[29.04.24, 15:31:57] ~ Ignasi: Where are you shipping COD and what monthly volume (orders)?
[29.04.24, 15:45:23] ~ Sonu Duhra: I did not shipped with COD
[29.04.24, 15:45:42] ~ Sonu Duhra: @⁨~Ignasi⁩
[29.04.24, 15:46:13] ~ Ignasi: ah ok
[29.04.24, 15:46:36] ~ Erik Pecovnik: @⁨~Ignasi⁩ @⁨René Crooijmans⁩ how do you deal with rejected parcels? Around 25% of our orders come back
[29.04.24, 15:53:58] ~ Facundo: I think this is a normal % for COD, i have 35% orders coming back in Mexico, 25% in Colombia and 30% in Chile 

what helps to improve this, is confirming the orders of course and having some automations via whatsapp to keep the customer updated about the logistic status of their order

With klarna for theiR EU funnels
[30.04.24, 1:52:25] ~ Y: You can either add a product and set it to Subscription with limited instalments of your own or add Klarna as a payment method under Funnel Apps > Funnelish Pay.
[30.04.24, 8:40:54] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, Which payment methods are the most popular in Germany?
[30.04.24, 8:54:29] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Klarna is a must
[30.04.24, 9:05:48] ~ Maxi: Are you sure ? 

Looks more like their have the whole Klarna merchant checkout connected via custom 

*atleast if you check via German IP
[30.04.24, 9:54:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: PayPal, Klarna, CC
[30.04.24, 10:19:00] ~ Mikael: Any alternative to Klarna? Klarna kicked us out
[30.04.24, 10:19:14] ~ Mikael: Any alternative to Klarna? They kicked us out
[30.04.24, 10:29:12] René Crooijmans: I know @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ has a setup that allows you to provide buy now pay later to your customers using direct invoicing
[30.04.24, 10:29:29] René Crooijmans: It works well in Germany, Sweden and Norway not so much
[30.04.24, 10:30:04] René Crooijmans: Basically a third party handles payment reminders and debt collection for you. Customer pays directly to your bank account

[30.04.24, 12:42:40] ~ Mikael: Would be glad to speak to him 🙏 sounds similur to Klarna?
[30.04.24, 12:43:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: When selling in big 4 with funnelish, do i need to make GEO funnels because of the currencies? Or is it possible to display different currencies based on location of potential customer
[30.04.24, 13:07:42] René Crooijmans: Yup similar to Klarna except that you don’t have to deal with Klarna’s fuckery
[30.04.24, 15:53:09] ~ Y: Use klarna through stripe if can’t get klarna native
[30.04.24, 15:55:53] ~ Mikael: We have a special case. So klarna closed us from all integrations with klarna. Stripe. Shopify payments. Merchant etc

[1.05.24, 14:48:36] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Very low, aiming for 30%
[1.05.24, 15:00:47] ~ Powa: Thank you. I heard you say it's better to go straight from the VSL to the sales page rather than using an advertorial?
[1.05.24, 17:50:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: This was something that was working for me better with my product, where i tested it. 

I send image ads to advertorial and VSLs to salespage, as in my opinion a VSL is the same as a advertorial, just a different format :)
[1.05.24, 17:51:01] ~ Powa: Thank you so much!

[1.05.24, 19:27:33] ~ Nils: You can test how many products you want at the same time.
[1.05.24, 19:28:21] ~ Mikael: So this have no specific impact on the ads performance when usibg same pixel?
[1.05.24, 19:28:23] ~ Nils: From a focus standpoint i personally however would recommend you to not spread yourself too thin. Its important trying to understand the person you are trying to sell to before you try to sell them something.
[1.05.24, 19:28:40] ~ Nils: In my experience, not really.
[1.05.24, 19:29:45] ~ Nils: It might have a miniscule impact, but what actually matters is your product, creative, funnel. If those are in place then it will not matter if you are running multiple products on the same pixel.

[2.05.24, 9:27:54] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Guys how do you usually deal with rejected VSL’s?

[2.05.24, 10:36:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Knowing the policy and making sure you keep removing stuff that might trigger it basically, if its copy or footage
[2.05.24, 10:36:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: both need to be done

[2.05.24, 12:50:20] ~ G M: Guys I opened a new stripe, and I get banned as soon as I make my first sales and stripe asks me for ID verification.

I have tried both without VPN and with VPN both banned.

How do you do this when you open a new stripe?
[2.05.24, 12:58:43] ~ Firass: If its a new stripe account and they did not ask for ID verification before your first sale its most likely they will ask for it after the first/second payment ‎<This message was edited>
[2.05.24, 12:59:40] ~ Firass: there is no real workaround with that
[2.05.24, 13:10:22] ~ Thomas Tran: Is anyone facing the high failed payment rate of Stripe US using Funnelish? 
We only have around 30-40% success rate using Stripe across all funnel
[2.05.24, 17:10:03] ~ Y: Is that a recent thing? Or it’s been like that always?
[2.05.24, 18:26:33] ~ Mukhtar: Hey guys,, 

What are the top 3 most important must haves in a video editor to hire 

We are running 3-6 min VSLs
[2.05.24, 18:27:51] ~ Thomas Tran: we experience it since last year. Any solution from your clients?
[2.05.24, 18:48:18] Topi: - Enough skill (basic level animation)
- Attitude (not give up / complain even lots of revisions in the beginning)
- Is proud of their work (this makes them being precise)

Other than that
- Some level of creativity
- Common sense
- Speed (comes usually with time)
[2.05.24, 18:52:36] Topi: If they don’t have the skills, VSL gets never done no matter how hard they try and your time (or team members time) goes into teaching / advicing. If they bitch even once during the first sets of revisions which are usually big because theyre just adapting into your style and process, they are not good. Same goes if they just care about getting the video done fast and pay. The best editors we found really care what they send to us and therefore they improve rapidly when they see what our senior editors do.
[2.05.24, 18:54:27] Topi: Not fast to find good editors, you have to test a lot. Bulk interview and have them do samples before using too much time into talking with them. Create a sheet that includes all payments etc explained so you can send it out for everyone at once.
[2.05.24, 18:54:52] Topi: Once you find good ones, ask if they have friends, usually they do as they are sharing info and thats how you get better than average leads
[2.05.24, 19:39:22] ~ Mukhtar: Wow, very valuable informations. Appreciate it brother
[2.05.24, 19:47:14] ~ Y: send me your details acct_…etc and will look into it, we recently made an update to 3DS and payment authorization optimization, and we did see many users impacted positively, if you haven’t noticed any improvement in the last 2 days then we can definitely look further into it.
[2.05.24, 20:50:40] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, which text to speech, floating text and maybe ai video creator are you guys using? Which are the best according to you?
[3.05.24, 1:27:54] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Hey guys! So i have a clothing store with a lot of designs, it was doing good, i was running some succesful ads that made me bring my store $6-$9k a day, but now everything started going down

The ads were going to the collection was being promoted

I asked a friend and my wife and they say as their customer perspective, maybe now i have a lot of designs and i should take some off (im doing POD btw)

What’s your suggestions? Should i keep the best sellers and redirect my ads to best sellers collection?🥹

I had like 180k likes in my ads and i’m afraid since they’re gonna be new with no likes, the ads wont perform as before

Any advice would be much appreciate it!🙏
[3.05.24, 2:34:26] Matán Intsuper: Try sending directly to product pages/collections/best sellers. The engagement the ads in our opinion doesn’t affect much the results
[3.05.24, 2:34:40] Matán Intsuper: If everything’s going down, try new designs
[3.05.24, 2:35:11] Matán Intsuper: And test prices/bundles/discounts
[3.05.24, 2:35:29] Matán Intsuper: And different types of ads (image/video/slideshow/carousel)
[3.05.24, 2:36:33] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Awesome! Thanks! I was actually thinking of adding $5 to the price of each item and say free shipping👀
[3.05.24, 2:36:56] Matán Intsuper: I personally prefer free shipping

If you want to keep running the same ads with the same post ID, you could just try and change that particular collection right?

[3.05.24, 9:25:42] ~ G M: Mathieu is working?
[3.05.24, 9:26:17] ~ lengjoo: nope, a lot are down now
[3.05.24, 10:16:42] ~ Luka: It may be because of too many options. What you can do in the collection pages is try separating it by "Best Sellers" & "Others". You significantly make the choice easier for them, plus the best sellers are best sellers for a reason - cause they like the designs so they'll also most likely like those designs more than others.
[3.05.24, 11:27:58] ~ David B: Free shipping 100% will raise conversions. Folding in the price is an excellent idea.

Sometimes you just need to give the product a few days and then look at the data on a longer timeframe.

If i deactivate shopify payments. and plugin stripe. will this affect my shop negatively? If i want to activate shopify payments again. can I do this without applying or anything. like instant adding shopify payments again
[4.05.24, 17:26:35] René Crooijmans: Yoo guys, is anyone in Bangkok right now?
[4.05.24, 17:30:12] ~ Kamal: Is klarna worth it if my product is like $50? We sell in the US to 40+ audience.

I didnt really consider it before but a lot of you guys seem to be using it

[4.05.24, 17:57:17] ~ Sam O: @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩ and everyone else.... You use after pay for $50 products ??
[4.05.24, 17:57:44] ~ Sam O: For like $100 - $150 AOV ?
[4.05.24, 17:57:52] ~ Sam O: People still use after pay ??
[4.05.24, 20:12:13] ~ Wouter Akika: For 100-150
[4.05.24, 20:13:57] ~ Wouter Akika: We did an incrementality test btw
[4.05.24, 20:13:58] ~ Sam O: What % of customers use after pay ???
[4.05.24, 20:14:19] ~ Wouter Akika: Only 5% cannibalization but 23% of rev
[4.05.24, 20:14:25] ~ Wouter Akika: So a 18% gain
[4.05.24, 20:15:21] ~ Sam O: You increased rev 18% using after pay ?
[4.05.24, 20:17:19] ~ Powa: Is it possible to use afterpay on funnelish?
[4.05.24, 20:17:44] ~ Wouter Akika: We just put an HTML afterpay button that redirects to a prepopulated shopify checkout
[4.05.24, 20:17:58] ~ Wouter Akika: Thats what noobu did for klarna with their EU funnels and we did the same
[4.05.24, 20:18:18] ~ Wouter Akika: Some people even do it for amazon, but we havent tried that yet
[4.05.24, 20:18:39] ~ Powa: Thanks a lot!

[4.05.24, 20:49:34] ~ Alessandro Sassi: If you deactivated Shopify payments to do it and you used markets to Sept different pricing yes, they will reset
[4.05.24, 20:52:50] ~ Mike Ramsey: You have to have entity / operations in the that region to offer Afterpay directly to the US market.   Or you can go through a reseller. ‎<This message was edited>

[4.05.24, 21:37:00] ~ Mikael: Yeah i notice lol

[6.05.24, 11:53:48] ~ Mikael: Hey fam. Im starting to think maybe swedish matrix blacklisted our company organisation nr. As payment method and banks are rejecting us without reason and some are giving us the reason "because of what happened with klarna". 

Anyone who have a idea or how we can build a structure outside sweden and still have klarna and all the other paymekt methods?
[6.05.24, 12:45:32] ~ Mikael: We would need to fix this issue ASAP. Atleast make a Quick fix somehow and start Selling again and then building a longer lasting fix behind scenes. We just need to get up and Selling as quickly as possible. For this we need either Klarna or Another payment solution well known to Scandinavians.
[6.05.24, 12:48:10] René Crooijmans: If you have a good relationship with your Chinese supplier you could get Klarna setup through an Ocean Payments account with them
[6.05.24, 12:48:31] ~ Mikael: would this be a Quick fix or how does it work?
[6.05.24, 17:46:20] ~ Mikael: If I would be purchasing or using a store with previous data and Revenue. but I change all the info and Company organisation nr in the shopify payment. would this affect and give us hold either way? ( I want to make a new store but dont have hold)
[6.05.24, 17:50:57] ~ Mikael: Also Another question. If i would want to get Afterpay to my English stores. have anyone done this? whats the fastest and easiest way? should i start a LLC in US or UK?
[6.05.24, 18:49:53] ~ Nils: What are the best websites for stock footage for VSLs?

‎[6.05.24, 19:22:08] ~ Powa: ‎image omitted
[6.05.24, 19:35:11] ~ Yusuf: checkout to purchase is extremely low, i usually have around 40-50% for that, it should be at least 30% imo

could it be possible that you have more purchases but people close the window before seeing thank you page? only then this rate could be normal
[6.05.24, 19:36:20] ~ Yusuf: adv2 and sales page conversions seem decent
[6.05.24, 19:46:14] ~ Powa: Thank you for your response. That was the only purchase I had, and all buyers were directed to the thank you page.
[6.05.24, 19:48:20] ~ Powa: Do you think the problem is on the checkout page?
[6.05.24, 19:49:59] ~ Yusuf: yes i think so, you can check the transaction attempts from payment provider if some transactions are declining

i only used shopify, benchmark metrics could be different but it seemed low to me
[6.05.24, 20:19:19] ~ Maxi: Cant be just said like that.

Our checkout purchase rate is around 9.8%

This always depends where your traffic is from, what kind of creatives (image or video) 

and mainly if you show the price on lander or not.

If you show the price on your landers for example, the checkout purchase rate should go up to 30-40% but then your CTR on landing page will drop.

There will always be a tradeoff, especially with an $100+ front end price
[6.05.24, 20:21:12] ~ Maxi: Also adv2 seems to not filter out enough people with a 40%+ CTR

[7.05.24, 4:45:48] Matán Intsuper: asking the customer / google maps
[7.05.24, 4:54:44] ~ Thomas Tran: we use WSH
[7.05.24, 4:55:14] ~ Thomas Tran: tried all of them. The problem is most of the time the address does not appear on Google Map
[7.05.24, 5:10:31] China Bigboss: What is WSH is it dropshipping agent
[7.05.24, 5:22:23] ~ Thomas Tran: no. its the shipping carrier. it appears on the tracking link. Our supplier use this line.
[7.05.24, 5:34:59] China Bigboss: Maybe we can help please share one address with us will check for you through our system and recommend the best way to ship it
[7.05.24, 5:35:18] China Bigboss: @⁨~Mutual-Sarah-China big boss⁩ check one this please

[7.05.24, 8:53:42] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys, how we can ab test price on Funnelish on active trafic?
[7.05.24, 9:26:50] René Crooijmans: 1. You would have to make a duplicate of your current checkout and re-add all of your products there with the updated pricing
2. ⁠Then you duplicate your landing page. You send 50% of the traffic to the old landing page and 50% to the new one. On this new landing page, you change the action for pressing a button from “next step” to “go to URL”. For the URL, you would put the URL of your new checkout with updated prices
[7.05.24, 9:27:50] René Crooijmans: Not 100% sure as I have not done it myself but I do know people who have. Ocean Payments is a HK/Chinese based payments company as far as I know. If you have a good relationship with your supplier, they can open an account for you under their name, and you have access to Klarna again
[7.05.24, 9:53:05] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Guys PayPal just asked me for additional information, should I register the account with an LLC or just use my full name?
[7.05.24, 12:46:16] ~ Santi Roa: Hey bro, do you have any idea why you got blocked this way? What were you doing wrong?

Bad customer service? Bad products? Long shipping times?
[7.05.24, 12:46:59] ~ Santi Roa: I know it has nothing to do with solving the problem fast. But I would reflect on why this happened because there must be a reason behind it
[7.05.24, 12:47:38] ~ Santi Roa: You can solve the material problem (getting new payment providers). But if you don't solve the underlying issue it might happen again
[7.05.24, 12:54:35] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you very much @⁨René Crooijmans⁩
[7.05.24, 13:42:11] René Crooijmans: No worries. You could make an additional 3rd checkout page for any e-mail marketing abandoned cart flows. Otherwise the results could be off
[7.05.24, 13:51:44] ~ Mikael: The short reason is matrix attacked us. We have good dispute rate and everything. But swedish govornment is making a hit on dropshipping in general on swedish companys. Nothing we could have done
[7.05.24, 13:52:34] ~ Mikael: I need new payment provider asap. At this moment wr are just considering rebranding on a new shopify store
[7.05.24, 14:42:14] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Who’s has a fashion brand?

How to test new products?

Pre-ordering?

The idea is to take as little risk as possible with stock.

Shopping
1 campaign per language or 1 per country?

[8.05.24, 16:36:08] ~ Vasile: Difficult to say without more context. In general, I would do per country. Each location has different CPCs. Keep everything as segmented as possible. If you have countries that don’t generate a lot of sales, group them together in 1 campaign. If you have low budget, you can do per language.
[8.05.24, 18:57:04] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Because we almost target worldwide with Facebook and actually have grouped 
- PMAX Shopify per language
- ⁠PMAX advertorial per language
[8.05.24, 19:02:28] ~ Sonu Duhra: unlike Facebook you can turn off countries that underperform with PMAX
[8.05.24, 19:03:29] ~ Sonu Duhra: anyone selling to Chinese speaking countries?
[8.05.24, 19:19:12] ~ Nils: Yeah most likely its the video that is the issue even though you are running it in another ad set, happens to us all the time

[9.05.24, 12:52:02] ~ Harout: yeah you might get banned for circumvention
[9.05.24, 12:52:13] ~ Mikael: wow okey. even tho its not mine?
[9.05.24, 12:56:52] ~ Harout: yeah if they have an asset thats flagged it can count as circumvention. Usually a page feeback score ban causes this for example. If its a security check BM restriction then maybe youll be fine
[9.05.24, 12:57:10] ~ Harout: but its a risk, the more of their assets you use e.g. their domain, ad account, page etc
[9.05.24, 12:57:13] ~ Mikael: fuck that not taking that risk haha
[9.05.24, 12:57:31] ~ Harout: yeah especially now fb is being tough again
[9.05.24, 12:57:37] ~ Mikael: I am looking to purchase or take over a existing store that allready had "hold" so that we might skip that hold on a new store. is this possible you think?

[9.05.24, 12:58:07] ~ Mikael: yeah payout hold
[9.05.24, 12:58:15] ~ Mikael: I allways recieve 120 day 20% hold on all new stores
[9.05.24, 12:58:28] ~ Harout: for the BM or payment processors?
[9.05.24, 12:58:32] ~ Mikael: shopify
[9.05.24, 12:58:38] ~ Mikael: shopify payments
[9.05.24, 12:59:03] ~ Harout: you could get away with this:
- new ad account
- new profile
- new BM
- new page
- new domain (eg add 'the' infront of the previous domain)
- new payment method
[9.05.24, 12:59:19] ~ Harout: so youre running it more safely
[9.05.24, 12:59:35] ~ Harout: id start with burner accounts and if it goes well then slowly legitimiza it
[9.05.24, 12:59:50] ~ Harout: e.g. agency ad account and a bought profile or one you dont care about much
[9.05.24, 13:02:22] ~ Mikael: Me myself dont have any issues with FB, I am just solely looking to take over a exisitng shopify store with a Revenue inorder to hopefully not get any hold in the beginning. (We will totally reconstruct this existing store to totally different. Everything different)
[9.05.24, 13:02:50] ~ Mikael: my other option is to just start a new shopify store myself and this will 100% get 120 day 20% hold.
[9.05.24, 13:35:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I have a store on my Dutch company that did about 2M in revenue which i dont use anymore, all on Shopify payments
[9.05.24, 13:35:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But i think if you change country and business they will check up again
[9.05.24, 13:35:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ofcourse, not sure though
[10.05.24, 0:30:43] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: We have this at least once every 2 or 3 days. We used to have it daily, but what causes this in the checkout is double payment method element. If you have product element, or payment method element double for some reason (such as one that is responsive for desktop, and one for the phone, this causes double-orders). 

We had this on our upsells too, and once we removed the duplicate, we never had it again.

We still have people place an order, arrive on Upsell #1, click the "back" button their browser, and place the order again, but to circumvent this we put a little disclaimer at the top, urging the person to NOT press the back button, as this may cause them to place a double-order. 

Unfortunately, besides the above, I have found nothing more to help, and customers will always be customers, I just had to eat the loss on the shipped products and CPA, when customers e-mail us regarding wanting to remove the excess item or items from their order, as sometimes they do this up to 6-7+ times, over and over, thinking it did not work the first 6 times....
[10.05.24, 1:34:24] ~ Y: Can you send me details pls! I am happy to look into it
[10.05.24, 8:14:13] Bob: Thank you for explaining this so well! 

We have this really as a standard issue as well, it happens on a daily basis. But it’s not insanenly many. 

Now it was just a spike.

But I will check this, we have also taken away all elements that where double so this wouldn’t happen.

But thanks for the tip about the back button! That’s actually very smart!
[10.05.24, 11:17:48] ~ Luka: I have 2 shopify stores that I'd like to be managed by 1 email. If I just transfer one of them to the other email - will there be any interruptions or things I should know about or is it just a super easy seamless process?
[10.05.24, 11:18:31] ~ Mikael: I just did this the other day and it seems seamless no issues. if you mean within Shopify to transfer to anotehr personal shopify login account?
[10.05.24, 11:18:51] ~ Luka: Yeah I want both shopify stores to have the same "Store owner" email
[10.05.24, 11:19:09] ~ Mikael: Yeah I did this the other day and it wasnt any interruption or anything
[10.05.24, 11:19:42] ~ Luka: Perfect thanks @⁨~Mikael⁩
[10.05.24, 13:06:53] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey Guys, we've got a little technical problem

When we want to launch new creative testing in our main abo campaign

It takes a very long time to load because there are so many adset


Any tips?

We've already tried to get an abo builder, but as soon as we duplicate in it, it takes a very long time.
[10.05.24, 13:12:04] ~ G M: Why don’t you add already all of them in the Media Library of the ad account?
‎[10.05.24, 17:07:06] ~ Maxi: ‎image omitted
[10.05.24, 17:07:17] ~ Maxi: Hey guys, anyone got their page ever "unpublished" by meta ?
[10.05.24, 17:07:37] ~ Maxi: Just happend to me.

Ads are still live, there is no restriction on the feedback score either
[10.05.24, 17:08:36] ~ Maxi: score is above 3.9
[10.05.24, 17:08:59] ~ Firass: yes the thing that worked for us getting the page live again was just to request a review
[10.05.24, 17:09:13] ~ Firass: usually that should do the trick
[10.05.24, 17:09:32] ~ Maxi: The only thing i had available was to "disagree" with that decision
[10.05.24, 17:10:02] ~ Firass: do you have other admins on the page who could try to request a review?
[10.05.24, 17:10:11] ~ Maxi: the page is not rejected
[10.05.24, 17:10:31] ~ Firass: I know its unpublished
[10.05.24, 17:10:45] ~ Firass: we got the same thing happening to us before
[10.05.24, 17:10:53] ~ Maxi: But my ads are still live
[10.05.24, 17:11:00] ~ Firass: ads would still be running
[10.05.24, 17:11:12] ~ Maxi: okay thats great
[10.05.24, 17:11:23] ~ Firass: but I cant tell you for how long though
[10.05.24, 17:11:58] ~ Firass: in our cases we got the page published before any ads would be turned off
[10.05.24, 17:12:14] ~ Maxi: Where can i see if the page is published again ?
[10.05.24, 17:12:37] ~ Firass: usually on the frontpage like the default page view
[10.05.24, 17:12:53] ~ Maxi: because its gone
[10.05.24, 17:13:01] ~ Maxi: 2 min after i pressed that i disagree
[10.05.24, 17:13:10] ~ Firass: check page quality
[10.05.24, 17:13:40] ~ Firass: Sometimes it happens because of a bug or the algo just senses some bs for no reason
[10.05.24, 17:14:03] ~ Maxi: Where do you mean the page quality ?
[10.05.24, 17:15:14] ~ Firass: account quality
[10.05.24, 17:15:26] ~ Firass: where you usually check feedback score
[10.05.24, 17:15:37] ~ Maxi: its all good
[10.05.24, 17:15:41] ~ Maxi: green 3.9
‎[10.05.24, 17:16:02] ~ Maxi: ‎image omitted
[10.05.24, 17:16:05] ~ Firass: you did not get any message that your page got published again?
[10.05.24, 17:16:13] ~ Maxi: nope
[10.05.24, 17:16:20] ~ Maxi: neither that it got un-published
[10.05.24, 17:16:28] ~ Maxi: i just saw it on accident
[10.05.24, 17:16:37] ~ Firass: thats weird 😂
[10.05.24, 17:16:51] ~ Firass: we usually get a notification at least via email
[10.05.24, 17:17:23] ~ Maxi: Yes that’s the only section I did not check
[10.05.24, 17:17:34] ~ Firass: would contact support to have them check if the page is published just to make sure
[10.05.24, 17:17:38] ~ Maxi: But I don’t have any other option now anyway except monitoring it for the next hours
[10.05.24, 17:17:45] ~ Maxi: Alright
[10.05.24, 17:17:48] ~ Maxi: Thanks man 👍🏻
[10.05.24, 17:17:50] ~ Firass: 👍🏼
[10.05.24, 17:33:13] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: My Va do this, but is for juste duplicate adaet and stuff like this that is too slow
[10.05.24, 17:33:29] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Is DMCA
[10.05.24, 17:33:52] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Because someone have send DMCA report
[10.05.24, 17:40:01] Topi: ^ can confirm
[10.05.24, 17:40:27] Topi: Also can be insider taken your page down paid by someone, happened for us
[10.05.24, 17:40:45] ~ Maxi: Ahh that’s nice
[10.05.24, 17:41:09] ~ Maxi: So the only way is to pay my own insider ?😂
[10.05.24, 17:41:38] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: What do you have do for reverse this?
[10.05.24, 17:43:34] ~ Maxi: How can I confirm if it’s 100% DMCA and who has done it?
[10.05.24, 17:48:01] Topi: Nothing can be done was reply for us
[10.05.24, 17:49:03] ~ Maxi: So you had to change page ?
[10.05.24, 17:53:29] ~ Maxi: Ours just got published again
[10.05.24, 17:53:37] ~ Maxi: We received a mail 1 min ago

[10.05.24, 18:31:42] Matán Intsuper: i lost a page with 300k followers back then
[10.05.24, 18:31:43] Matán Intsuper: and this page owned a group with 50k people
[10.05.24, 18:31:51] Matán Intsuper: so i lost control on both page and group
[10.05.24, 18:31:55] Matán Intsuper: the group is now without admins
[10.05.24, 18:33:18] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team. Please meet @⁨~Arad Khazabi⁩ our awesome team member in ESS. He’s 17 years old from Switzerland, done 7 figs with Ecom and here to help you and give you feedback.
[10.05.24, 18:36:10] ~ Arad Khazabi: Thank you @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ , excited to be here guys!
[10.05.24, 18:44:55] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: What was the reason? @⁨~Maxi⁩
[10.05.24, 18:45:26] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Welcome @⁨~Arad Khazabi⁩ from French part or German part?
[10.05.24, 18:46:05] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We got this too and then Facebook penalize our other page for same domain
[10.05.24, 18:46:14] ~ Maxi: Just some generic bs.. doing stuff against moral practices and so on..

@⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩ 

My theory:

Too many rejected ads, we were quite forcing FB and got a rejection rate of 4 out of 10 VSLs getting rejected,
[10.05.24, 18:46:37] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Okay I see
[10.05.24, 18:47:52] ~ Maxi: We had some crazy aggressive hooks & leads for the last 7-8 batches and the page has 30+ rejected ads that havent been cleaned up yet
[10.05.24, 18:55:23] ~ Arad Khazabi: german part!
[10.05.24, 19:17:23] ~ Yusuf Business: Hey guys, is it okay to run exactly the same ads to same domain under different BMs and ad accounts? 

I want to try agency ad accounts, they give me access only under their bm and I don’t want to stop my current ads. So want to make sure that it’s safe
[10.05.24, 19:20:29] Topi: For us no harm
[10.05.24, 19:21:00] ~ Yusuf Business: Thanks, is it okay to do it from different pages? Just to diversify
[10.05.24, 19:23:43] Topi: Yeah for us no issues either with that
[10.05.24, 19:23:53] ~ Yusuf Business: Thanks!
[10.05.24, 21:03:18] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I am from Neuchatel

[11.05.24, 12:15:23] ~ Arad Khazabi: Alles bestens, bei dir?
[11.05.24, 12:16:09] ~ Sonu Duhra: All good 🙏 greatings from Germany
[11.05.24, 13:32:15] ~ Mohamed Feki: Hey guys, what's the minimum hold rate for profitable creative?
[11.05.24, 13:34:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Its not the hold rate that determines profitability
[11.05.24, 13:34:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But i always aim for about 30% at least
[11.05.24, 13:36:22] ~ Mohamed Feki: even for vsl video?
[11.05.24, 13:37:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: It doesnt really matter how long your video is
[11.05.24, 13:38:14] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Your hold rate is between 3 and 15 seconds
[11.05.24, 13:38:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So jeah, still aiming for 30 with VSLs also
[11.05.24, 13:39:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: When you see your hook rate and hold rate percentage close together in terms of percentages, that means its nice and congruent, i think thats more important.
[11.05.24, 13:39:58] ~ Mohamed Feki: okaay thankss bro
[11.05.24, 13:44:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Welcome bro!
[11.05.24, 17:59:02] ~ Santiago: By any chance, does anyones has a swipe file of fashion advertorials?
[12.05.24, 2:22:31] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Hey guys, my ads sucked today, almost no sales, is it because of mother’s day?😅 did someone else got impacted today? Hehe
[12.05.24, 4:26:26] ~ Santi Roa: Our new customer roas increased 6% today but I wouldn't be scared if one day results vary
[12.05.24, 4:26:54] ~ Santi Roa: It's been like this ever since
[12.05.24, 7:59:34] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey Guys, what is your best app that you use for organize creative footage and stuff?
[12.05.24, 9:26:13] Bob: Our ads started performing like shit as well yesterday, but won’t be too worried about it. Just 1 day for now
[12.05.24, 9:31:10] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Guys does adding new ads to an advantage plus campaign reset the learning phase?

We’ve been using this advantage plus campaign and scaling it vertically we throw in new creatives to test and kill the bad ones
[12.05.24, 10:04:27] ~ Mikael: When signing up for stripe. Do you guys signup with your website url or a "company" url?
[12.05.24, 10:04:48] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I do website
[12.05.24, 10:04:57] ~ Firass: website
[12.05.24, 10:14:38] ~ Arad Khazabi: How is it normally?
[12.05.24, 10:14:46] ~ Arad Khazabi: Website
[12.05.24, 10:15:07] ~ Arad Khazabi: Not if it’s out of the learning phase
[12.05.24, 10:16:33] ~ Arad Khazabi: I hope I understand the question right. most people I know including me simply just use google drive, but gotta keep it organized ofc
[12.05.24, 10:45:38] ~ Mikael: Whats the most easiest way to connect stripe and its payment methods to Shopify? for example Klarna and AfterPay?
[12.05.24, 11:28:59] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I heard about Iconik.io that it will be really great, I will try this week
[12.05.24, 11:30:12] ~ Arad Khazabi: Sure man let me know how that went, might also try it out
[12.05.24, 12:59:37] ~ Mikael: Can a US Company get Klarna in Europé?
[12.05.24, 13:19:28] ~ Harout: who are you guys using for agency ad accounts? are they affordable & reliable? please DM:)
[12.05.24, 13:55:41] ~ Kevin Krieg: Apparently this trick still works: set your store location to france. Then you can use the official stripe integration. It doesnt show up when you are in a different country, but for france it does.

Then after its conmected you can swap back.

Mind you shopify might think its weird and request verification or sth. We used to do it for new stores because new ones are not critical if sth happens to them. I wouldnt do it for running stores tho, too risky that sth happens imo
[12.05.24, 14:01:51] ~ Mikael: I tried this but with another country. It worked to connect stripe. But only the card payment methods were available/activated on the store. I want to connect Afterpay and Klarna from stripe
[12.05.24, 14:04:22] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hmm, interesting. Idk sorry
[12.05.24, 14:50:24] ~ Santi Roa: We use them, their set-up team sucks, their billing team sucks, but the tech is decent for what we need them
[12.05.24, 14:50:37] ~ Santi Roa: So overall is good, but keep in mind that implementation will probably take 2 weeks or more
[12.05.24, 16:36:31] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you very much for your feedback bro, any other alternative?
[12.05.24, 16:36:50] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Already 1 week that we wait for get access.. time is money
[12.05.24, 16:38:33] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: Guys how do you usually deal with bad days with meta ads? We’ve been running some ads but the results really fluctuate a lot and today is pretty bad
[12.05.24, 16:41:45] ~ Mohammed-amine: ‎This message was deleted.
[12.05.24, 16:55:23] ~ Santi Roa: Just push them and wait. There's no better alternative
[12.05.24, 16:56:35] ~ Santi Roa: Just keep in mind it will take more time so get prepared to make good ads without it
[12.05.24, 19:52:11] ~ Maxi: Well check always last 7 days never judge by one single day
[12.05.24, 22:26:50] ~ Arad Khazabi: Agree

[13.05.24, 7:25:58] ~ Mikael: Does anyone know any Shopify insider? our new store got closed after first day of launch Because of violation of section 7 "Personal, confidential, and protected health information".
Which doesn´t make any sence at all
[13.05.24, 9:00:26] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Happened to me twice, you get an email from shopify where they ask for documents, supplier invoices etc. 

Once you send them those documents and they see everything is legit they will re-open the stores
[13.05.24, 9:01:38] ~ Mikael: I opened this store yesterday. So we dont have any sales or traffic yet. Also the email did not state anything only that they have terminated my store. So i contacted the shopify support trough Chat and they were gono escalate it... How long did it take for you to open again?
[13.05.24, 9:02:39] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Same, happened 24 hours after creating the store
[13.05.24, 9:02:46] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: It takes 2-3 days
[13.05.24, 9:03:06] ~ Mikael: okey thx alot bro for the info. Did you have same violation? section 7
[13.05.24, 9:03:50] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Yes
[13.05.24, 9:04:55] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: If you are in contact with shopify support ask for the ticket ID of the email from the legal team and search for it in your inbox. Once you find it just send all documents as reply to their email
[13.05.24, 9:05:56] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: You have to appeal their decision first
[13.05.24, 9:06:20] ~ Mikael: I did not get any appeal option
[13.05.24, 9:06:35] ~ Mikael: I only recived a email stating my store have been closed due to violation of section 7
[13.05.24, 9:07:14] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: https://help.shopify.com/en/legal/inquiry
‎[13.05.24, 9:07:50] ~ Mikael: ‎image omitted
[13.05.24, 9:08:05] ~ Mikael: No case on it just closed
[13.05.24, 9:11:01] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Alright ask shopify support if they have a ticket ID and send an email to legal@shopify.com with the Ticket ID and tell them you want to dispute the closure of your store
[13.05.24, 9:11:15] ~ Mikael: okey thx bro Ill do this
[13.05.24, 10:54:58] ~ Mikael: Anyone here who have knowledge about company structuring?
[13.05.24, 11:00:02] ~ Mikael: Hey bro, can I dm you?
[13.05.24, 11:49:07] ‪+971 56 963 4932‬: Sure
[13.05.24, 12:33:36] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank bro
[13.05.24, 12:52:55] ~ Maxi: Guys who is using google display campaign + advertorial actively ?
[13.05.24, 12:53:51] ~ Ignasi: < very interested as well
[13.05.24, 13:04:41] ~ Facundo: Guys any tip to deal with rejected ads on tik tok? 

I get some approved, then when i duplicate them to scale, i get the duplicates rejected 

Frustrating because happens with almost every ad
[13.05.24, 13:26:49] ~ Arad Khazabi: Do you include to much skin in your ads, copyright, etc?
[13.05.24, 13:35:58] ~ seth: hi guys how can i check the failed payment with shopify payment?
[13.05.24, 14:23:18] ~ Facundo: not really, maybe copy but thats why i dont understand why i get some approved and then automatically rejected once i duplicate them
[13.05.24, 14:30:11] ~ Arad Khazabi: Maybe could just be the tiktok algorithm
[13.05.24, 14:30:20] ~ Arad Khazabi: Should be on settings, billing
[13.05.24, 15:36:40] ~ Kamal: Hey guys, anyone know how to set up a quiz prelander? preferably in funnelish
[13.05.24, 16:01:25] ~ Allan L: Can be done with javascripts and css if they dont have a app.
[13.05.24, 16:09:24] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Is anyone using agency ad accounts with cashback? Are they better than using an ad account with a high spend history in one's own bm?
[13.05.24, 16:17:08] Topi: Yes
[13.05.24, 16:17:18] Topi: We are using
[13.05.24, 16:17:40] Topi: We tested them versus our own, no difference for us so cashback obviously makes sense then
[13.05.24, 16:45:24] ~ Alessandro Sassi: that's cool! Will test one soon
[13.05.24, 17:00:26] ~ Mukhtar: Hey guys, 
Do you guys recommend anyone for optimizing funnelish
[13.05.24, 17:00:31] ~ Mukhtar: Funnel
[13.05.24, 17:00:32] ~ Mukhtar: Speed
[13.05.24, 17:13:27] ~ Kamal: Yea was hoping there was an easier way but I think I'll do that
[13.05.24, 17:13:57] ~ Kamal: How much cash back does an agency account get you?
[13.05.24, 18:16:18] ~ L: Hey everyone, I'm thinking of moving my store from the UK to the US. Right now, I'm running ads from an account set on UK time. Do you think it could mess with performance if the ads are delivered in UK time instead of US time?
[13.05.24, 18:31:21] ~ Ignasi: No. It’s fine
[13.05.24, 19:04:57] ~ L: ‎This message was deleted.
[13.05.24, 19:05:14] ~ L: Thank you. Have you had any experience with this? Are there any considerations I should be aware of when the country and ad account have mismatched time zones?
[13.05.24, 19:09:45] ~ Ignasi: Yes. Quite a lot of experience. Having accounts with different time-zones and using an attribution tool like Hyros (can’t speak for the others) messes things up badly as Hyros can only work with one time zone, so you get unreliable attribution data.

If you still want to do it, you can solve reporting of diff time-zone accounts in ads reporting in meta which works really well, and you can chose 1-day, 7-day etc attribution so long as you select more than one account (and save your Hyros money for other stuff)

From my experience running everything in your time zone is so much easier for you, and you’ll see that Facebook will pace spending during day/night of the time zone your campaign is targeting. So in the morning Europe will be spending a lot, and the US will be asleep spending close to nothing.
[13.05.24, 19:21:25] ~ L: Ok great thank you very much!

So nothing to be worried about Ad delivery, Facebook will basically take care of it.
I should only expect some mismatch on the attributions tool because of the different timezone, correct?
Thank you again 👍🏻
[13.05.24, 20:18:02] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Should be 4%
[13.05.24, 20:45:37] ~ Ignasi: Yes if you use 2 accounts with different time zones and a 3rd party tool for attribution that doesn’t have multiple time zones like hyros

[14.05.24, 7:09:44] ‪+972 50‑755‑7706‬: Hey guys, what’s your strategy for testing completely new landing page?

Do you always send a percentage of your entire traffic or open a new campaign with that kind of page?

Would love to know
[14.05.24, 7:21:01] ~ Luka: You can send a % traffic from your existing campaigns that way the data is much more accurate. Even with the same LP, 2 different campaigns will get you 2 different results
[14.05.24, 11:11:10] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Hey guys, which apps do you use on Shopify for reviews? I used vitals but it was not sending request properly, now I am using loox but it expensive to request reviews

[14.05.24, 11:24:19] ~ Arad Khazabi: then by clicking on orders, and then on the specific customer, if they had a failed payment, it should be visible on the notes section ‎<This message was edited>

[15.05.24, 12:20:42] ‪+39 389 876 4351‬: You think that’s because of learning phase right?

[16.05.24, 8:20:14] ‪+972 50‑755‑7706‬: Hey guys,

We have a lot of uncertainty when it comes to our Shopify funnel. I would like to know the drop off points between different points in the funnel (LP  to collection, collection to PP, etc) I would also like to find out what the journey is when it comes to our highest converting sessions

What’s the best way to do this? Is something I can do myself? If I need a specialist, what is their position called?

Thank you! ‎<This message was edited>

Some of ESS work with
[16.05.24, 8:44:23] Matán Intsuper: You can use google analytics or hot jar for example, you can do it yourself, you can track different journeys or specific ones ‎<This message was edited>
[16.05.24, 9:36:29] ~ Mikael: Also, anyone who knows a stripe expert or insider? Someone who knows the best practices with stripe.
[16.05.24, 10:44:21] ~ Yusuf Business: You can check lucky orange too to see customer journey for each session
[16.05.24, 10:50:17] ~ Yusuf Business: I don’t know exactly how it works but buying feedback doesn’t have big impact in my opinion

I have two stores, similar type of ads, same customer experience in terms of shipping time, support etc. only different products

I never bought feedback for one of them and score is always 4+

I pay 2k every month for feedbacks for the other store and score is always between 2-3
- I tested not buying plenty of times, usually overall feedback is 0.2-0.5 lower when I don’t buy

So I think it comes down to true expectations, product quality, good communication and probably positive reviews on ad/ page/ posts etc. ‎<This message was edited>
[16.05.24, 10:51:43] ~ Malak: Hi brother, contact him he's doing my feedback went from 1.8 to 3.4 in 1 month. 💪
[16.05.24, 10:51:59] ~ Malak: And also he's delivering really quality feedbacks and Facebook assets.
‎[16.05.24, 10:52:04] ~ Malak: ‎Contact card omitted
[16.05.24, 11:30:42] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you bro
[16.05.24, 11:30:54] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you
[16.05.24, 11:36:38] ~ Yusuf Business: maybe with him it works, I will try him too, thank you @⁨~Malak⁩
[16.05.24, 11:37:49] ~ Malak: He's really good man, like if I am honest I tried Zefi Agency out was shit and all the other agencies but this guy has his own shit in Vietnam I think and is like a bit priced but deliveres everytime the quality what I want man. Really suggest him!
[16.05.24, 11:43:04] ~ Yusuf Business: thanks brother! I only worked with zefi so far
[16.05.24, 11:45:58] ~ Malak: Yeah bullshit guys, ordered really thousands from them they didn't do shit. Just talking bullshit and not helping further.
[16.05.24, 11:47:04] ~ RS: I just have a guy from upwork that I use for FB feedback scores. 1 feedback costs like 1.5$. If you order in bulk, it will be lower price.
[16.05.24, 11:50:54] ~ Malak: Quite expensive man, the guy who I send do it for 0.95/feedback.
[16.05.24, 11:52:32] ~ RS: Yep but for how many scores it is? From this guy you can buy even 100 scores and the price for it is 1.5. Ir you order 1k scores then price will be much lower. I have not tested others but I can say that from this guy my feedback score is improving
[16.05.24, 11:53:35] ~ Malak: I don't know what his MOQ is man, I think this should be not a problem. I order always 1500-2000 feedback per week.
[16.05.24, 12:02:34] ~ Santi Roa: You got to face reality bro. There should be something you are doing wrong.

Better catch it early
[16.05.24, 12:06:43] ~ Santi Roa: Either you are ripping off another brand, and that's the reason behind volatility, because you might be retargeting their customers

Or you are over-selling your product, lying about the benefits/results.

Or you are shipping directly from china, taking 15 days to deliver orders
[16.05.24, 12:06:49] ~ Santi Roa: Or maybe the product is crap
[16.05.24, 12:07:05] ~ Santi Roa: But you have to find out quickly what is happening and solve it
[16.05.24, 12:08:12] ~ Santi Roa: You can ignore these problems or "solve them" by buying feedback. But they will keep showing up until you learn the real lesson
[16.05.24, 12:17:37] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: You are 100% right bro

I over selling my product I think 
I ship from China

We have improve the products severals times and we have good feedback by emails that is weird and in another domain same product score page is 3.5

We will change of supplier and put more focus on this area
But curious to know how many agents you have guys

We have 2 for hotline
3 for email + facebook 
And 1 only for dispute part time 

For about 500-750 orders days
[16.05.24, 12:41:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Bro when i was general dropshipping back in the days, i solved the feedback issue with transparency. 

I just displayed the exact shipping time in my above the fold section, if you are using funnels you can do that on checkout. 

I managed to hit 4+ page scores on all of my pages for all countries for years this way
[16.05.24, 12:42:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Besides that ofcourse killer customer service and quality products
[16.05.24, 14:20:33] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I show my exact shipping delay on my Facebook page + I have a strong email post purchase email flow
[16.05.24, 14:32:47] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But who actually looks at your Facebook page?
[16.05.24, 14:32:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah i had this too
[16.05.24, 14:33:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: But displaying something like "will be delivered between (date) & (date)" works really well. This gave a huge boost in feedback score, and also i got way viewer mails
[16.05.24, 14:33:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And it didnt affect my CVR at all
[16.05.24, 15:02:49] ~ Maxi: @⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩ 

We have multiple disclaimers on our thank you page.

First for the shipping time, in how many days they can expect their order.

Then for the upsells, that Incase they  feel like they have been overcharged, didn’t wanted to buy or felt forced to buy something they didn’t wanted they can cancel immediately. 

That each upsell represents a different charge, which is normal.

Our statement descriptor so they know exactly why and by who they got billed.

Once you add those things, not only the page score should get better but also the fraud and chargebacks will get better
[16.05.24, 15:04:07] ~ Maxi: This way you might have more refunds first hand, but it does not matter, since you ended paying double via buying some score service that obviously is not working
[17.05.24, 4:29:28] ~ L: Guys, how do you tell when an advertorial is dead or suffering from fatigue? 

I still have good CR from ADV to PP but not good results (I have already tried sending new fresh ads)
[17.05.24, 7:25:05] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Customer and competitor why?
[17.05.24, 7:25:17] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We have exactly this
[17.05.24, 7:26:01] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you guys for your advices I will review all

[18.05.24, 11:14:17] ~ Mikael: Anyone using Stripe for Shopify with multicurrencys? does it work and how?
[18.05.24, 11:15:44] ~ Alessandro Sassi: If you mean multicurrency at the checkout page, only Shopify payments supports it
[18.05.24, 11:16:08] ~ Mikael: Yeah exactly. Im trying to figure out if its possible with stripe. as we are swtiching to stripe instead of Shopify payments
[18.05.24, 11:27:27] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Let me know if you find out I have the same issue 🤣
[18.05.24, 11:27:37] ~ Mikael: haha for sure xD
[18.05.24, 11:27:53] ~ Mikael: Maybe Ill just create afew more Shopify stores lol

[18.05.24, 15:03:44] ~ Erik Pecovnik: That was my soulution
[18.05.24, 15:04:20] ~ Erik Pecovnik: So customer were able to checkout in different currencies without shopify payments?
[18.05.24, 19:40:18] ~ Zain Ahmed: Hey guys, we didn’t file federal US income taxes for 2023. Does anyone have an ecom tax accountant they would recommend? How much are you guys paying for 1065 with K-1 forms (LLC)? ‎<This message was edited>

[18.05.24, 23:26:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Any of you guys ever sold in Japan?
[18.05.24, 23:27:56] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Only to americans who live there because of the army😅
[19.05.24, 5:34:02] ~ Luka: HexClad does, you can check what they do different for Japan https://hexclad.co.jp/ 

Random observation: I just came from Osaka & Kyoto yesterday. One thing that stood out for me in retail shops is that it seems they do not like simple/clean packaging. Even big brands like Pepsi change their designs to be a lot more graphic-heavy. However doesn't have to mean your ecom product has to. Seems like HexClad's website is identical to their western sites.
‎[19.05.24, 5:34:08] ~ Luka: ‎image omitted
[19.05.24, 6:49:19] ~ Zain Ahmed: Do any of you guys use prompts for hooks? I’m finding it really hard to get quality hooks other than just looking at spy tools and coming up with them myself.

I’ve even tried the stefan georgi ones and they’re pretty awful too.
[19.05.24, 10:26:58] ~ Musawer: Do you guys have recommendations for a more affordable tracking app?

I use 17track but it's very expensive.
[19.05.24, 10:38:07] ~ Mikael: We use parcelpanel which is great, dont know the price difference tho. But never had any issues with this

[19.05.24, 11:49:36] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Guys who run multiple fb ad accounts for the same brand
Ever notice how this can have a negative impact?

We have the impression that as soon as one account has good results it has an impact on the other.
[19.05.24, 12:29:08] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys! Anyone here doing surf scaling in Facebook with great results? How do you approach it exactly?
[19.05.24, 12:44:53] ~ Ignasi: If it’s same product and/or same narrow audience you will get overlap and de-ambiguition problems when it comes to attribution 

If products and audiences are completely different you should be ok
[19.05.24, 15:02:07] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Okay so maybe test different market
We have try with other page like 3rd party etc but really seem like each impact other
[19.05.24, 15:47:57] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I have created a new ad account and set up some campaign, but they are not spending any money, what might be the reason for that?
[19.05.24, 16:13:48] ~ Wouter Akika: Bug
[19.05.24, 16:13:52] ~ Wouter Akika: 1. Reset ads manager
[19.05.24, 16:13:57] ~ Wouter Akika: 2. Turn all camps off & on

Its not a big transaction, so dont want too much set in motion.
Basically, I did a deposit to Embily bank 55 days ago and still havent received anything and they refuse to do a refund as it would take longer than receiving the deposit on my wallet with them.

I've been given multilple dates on when it should have arrived in my wallet, but they always kept coming up with new excuses and still saying I need to have patience and be waiting.

Basically just want to send a legitimate email to hopefully scare them in to refunding.

[21.05.24, 14:30:07] ~ Sonu Duhra: Hi guys, whats the main difference between advertorial and VSL in terms of the Framework?
[21.05.24, 14:34:22] ~ David B: The frameworks overlap quite a lot. And you should apply the same principles. The biggest difference is you need to signpost an advertorial much more with good subheadings and headlines. People rarely read an advertorial from top to bottom. They check the headline to make sure they're in the right place, then skip to the part of most interest to them. 

People don't usually skip to different points in a VSL so your hook and lead need to be very strong and call out a big pain point and open a loop to keep the engagement there.
[21.05.24, 14:36:18] ~ Sonu Duhra: Ok nice thanks
[21.05.24, 14:46:30] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey team,

[21.05.24, 16:03:38] ~ Kamal: Do you guys do anything to optimize for CPM's on facebook? Some of my advertorials will get a $10 CPM and others $35. Same exact creative, primary text etc.

Is it due to relevance of the creative/advertorial match?
Or is this something i shouldn't look at

[21.05.24, 20:33:13] ~ Wouter Akika: FYI, I reset the ads manager, campaigns, adsets & ads like I shared yesterday & that fixed the underspending

Move all succesful abo's to concept / angle specific ASC's

Scale up ASC's when succesful

Decrease budgets when slacking

[22.05.24, 1:17:36] ~ Wouter Akika: Biggest thing is having a bunch of non competing ASC's
[22.05.24, 1:18:35] ~ L: And this is the reason why you isolate angles/concepts, right?
[22.05.24, 4:07:10] ~ Wouter Akika: ASC's only will spend on 2-3 ads at a time, so if you only have one your account can't scale IMO, so we looked for logical ways to segment without competing

Millions await.
[25.05.24, 22:29:37] ~ Gedion: Hey guys, Do the most of you use family & friends accounts or personal accounts for Facebook? 

Or agency facebook structures with multiple profiles? 
- Have been having issue with this one myself as profiles are getting unnecessary blocked. And needing to keep buying pieces of the structure again. 

I am thinking now to go for the family & friends route (buying a cheap laptop to keep at their home) as i have heard there is any to none issues with these. 

Anyone that uses these that would recommend one to stick too?? 
Also new options are welcome!
[25.05.24, 22:40:23] ~ Yusuf Business: buying fb profiles from sellers never worked for me actually, buying from family & friends work perfectly well, never had issues ‎<This message was edited>
[25.05.24, 22:44:37] ~ Yusuf Business: I don’t buy new laptop.

When I buy a profile from someone I know, I get their FB profile, email connected to FB and passport photo (in case FB asks for id proof at some point)

They need to log out of their profiles from everywhere. 

Then I wait 2-3 days to login their profile. This is needed especially if you’re located in different country than the person you bought from. I login from my computer.

If your profile is banned on your computer, I suggest opening new user, it works as new computer on FB eyes.

When you first login to profile, don’t try to change security settings such as 2 fac authentication, password, etc. The profile can get blocked

First two weeks, I warm them up by engaging with 10 posts a day, sending messages to other fb profiles (usually the ones my team or me control)

Only then I change security settings, add to ad accounts, never had issues with this structure. My team members implement the same steps if their profiles get banned at some point ‎<This message was edited>
[25.05.24, 23:25:48] ~ Gedion: Hadn’t had any problems regarding using different IP adress for the same profile?
[25.05.24, 23:59:33] ~ G M: The most important thing is make sure you’re using anti detect browser based on chrome.

Use dolphin anty, free version up to 10 profiles. I don’t use anymore proxy, vpn. Just dolphin with 20+ profiles no bans.

So it really doesn’t matter if you use family profile or bought profiles. Do normal actions at first and then start using them after 2-3 days, just buy normal Asian profiles, are the best for me. ‎<This message was edited>
[26.05.24, 0:27:02] ~ Yusuf: the problems happen if they are still logged in at some devices, they can forget but maybe logged in in mobile, tablet, etc. then when you login from different city/ country, it triggers

if they are completely logged out and you login after 2-3 days, never had issues
[26.05.24, 1:10:34] ~ Gedion: Im using Adspower Global with 20 profiles at the moment, but with them I need to add proxies myself.

Renting them from other platform and adding them to each profile. Paying 2$ a month for every proxy in use
[26.05.24, 12:22:55] ~ Allan L: 2$ per month for a proxy screams datacenter to me.
Might as well just use your own IP at that point
[26.05.24, 18:41:36] Topi: Hey guys, newt Wednesday is the next VSL call.

[26.05.24, 23:34:35] ~ Mohamed Feki: Hey guys, what's the usual price for gateway insiders to remove a hold? I have 20% on hold with Shopify Payments
[26.05.24, 23:35:47] ~ Joshua: Interested in this too
[26.05.24, 23:40:01] ~ Bretten Hadley: Yes 20% hold is standard + you’ll be in a monitoring program for 90 days. After that period they review your account and determine to release your funds or put further limitations on your payouts.
[26.05.24, 23:41:57] ~ Joshua: My review period should be up pretty soon… is there anything extra I should be doing to make sure they release the hold?
[27.05.24, 0:47:19] ~ Mike Ramsey: These holds can vary and change per region, product you’re selling, AOV, scaling %’s month over month plus factor in your dispute and chargeback levels.  

It’s not always required to have a 20% reserve and you can get those lowered based on your overall business strength.

Also, your Shopify plan can allow them to be more lenient in some cases.

We work with reserve recovery / reduction often with Shopify payments, Stripe, PayPal, etc.

If you have questions feel free to DM and we can provide insights. ‎<This message was edited>
[27.05.24, 0:50:28] ~ Bretten Hadley: Signing up for chargeback prevention programs like Midigator is a good option, also increasing support staff and having better refund policies are all good ways to increase your chances of releasing holds. 

If your metrics improve before the 90 days you can request an early review and they’ll consider releasing most of the funds.
[27.05.24, 1:15:01] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: What CS response times should I aim for? How many VAs should be working CS? We have 100 e-mails per day, and we do 10-15kUSD per day in revenue currently. 

We only have 1 VA on CS, and she works 6 hours per day currently. We don't measure CS score or response times however, because we do it all through Zoho E-mail, not Zendesk or anything. 

Is this urgent to fix, and if so, how should I proceed? This is my first ever ecom store

[27.05.24, 17:56:57] ~ Mikael: Anyone got some best practices to follow for a bulletproof Stripe account?
[27.05.24, 18:09:25] ~ Wouter Akika: Don't use stripe
[27.05.24, 18:10:15] ~ Wouter Akika: That's the best practice for 90% of e-commerce companies
[27.05.24, 18:10:33] ~ Mikael: I´ve Heard otherwise tho
[27.05.24, 18:10:53] ~ Wouter Akika: What's the argument for using stripe?
[27.05.24, 18:11:27] Bob: What do you recommend instead?
[27.05.24, 18:12:02] ~ Wouter Akika: Checkout.com, Reach, Braintree (Enterprise), ISO's, Finnix
[27.05.24, 18:12:04] ~ Mikael: 1. more payment methods.
2. You can talk to the customer support when having holds.
3. If stripe burns, you wouldnt burn your store as shopify payments can do.
4. etc etc.
[27.05.24, 18:12:30] Bob: Thanks man!
[27.05.24, 18:12:58] ~ Wouter Akika: @⁨~Mikael⁩ You should never have holds, holds only happen because Stripe is wholesaling MID's to 1000s of merchants such as yourself instead of you having your own MID
[27.05.24, 18:13:34] ~ Wouter Akika: A normal processor would do a review every 90 days & maybe give you a 5% hold for the next quarter
[27.05.24, 18:13:45] ~ Mikael: hmm sounds interesting
[27.05.24, 18:13:49] ~ Wouter Akika: True, you do have more options for international! But Checkout.com does that too brother
[27.05.24, 18:14:07] ~ Wouter Akika: I would never use stripe / shopify payments, they are also one & the same, they use stripe on the backend
[27.05.24, 18:14:49] ~ Mikael: How does checkout.com look at new businesses? are they accepted? i mean i just started new Companys, also some new websites
[27.05.24, 18:15:50] ~ Wouter Akika: They have a monthly minimum of 1M through credit cards now, which sucks, you were able to get in more easily before, but I would engage & negotiate whether you meet it or not & then sell them the vision of your company, they want to grow just as you do!
[27.05.24, 18:22:17] ~ Wouter Akika: When getting payment processors you need a few levels of negotiation

1. Payout frequency (Daily is best)
2. Payout Times (T+1 is best, means next day payout)
3. Fixed Reserve (You want this to be 0)
4. Rolling Reserve (You want this to be 0)
5. Underwriting / Instant access (You want underwriting to happen, stripe does not underwrite and that's why you get fucked in the ass, they never did due diligence so they pull the plug the moment you get any disputes / sales increase)
6. Interchange + X (go for 0.1-0.4%)
7. Price per transaction (go for 0.05-0.15 max)
[27.05.24, 18:24:58] ~ Wouter Akika: DM me & I can intro you to 2 brokers that can hep you
[27.05.24, 20:25:45] ~ Mikael: Btw, doed anyone have any stripe insider? Or personal manager?
[27.05.24, 20:26:05] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Yes - I work with ~10 different account managers
[27.05.24, 20:26:13] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Feel free to DM me

[27.05.24, 20:45:37] ~ Joshua: Does anyone have a good way to get post IDs? There are so many ads I'm having a hard time finding the ones I want to duplicate and scale.
[27.05.24, 20:59:48] ~ Arad Khazabi: i most likely go to the section with all the post IDs
[27.05.24, 20:59:55] ~ Arad Khazabi: and see the ones i am looking for but with the most engagement
[27.05.24, 20:59:58] ~ Arad Khazabi: and just use them
[27.05.24, 21:00:22] ~ Arad Khazabi: but generally if you test ad creatives, you should use post ids right away otherwise it gets an hassle with finding the right ad with all those different post ids as you're struggling with right now
[27.05.24, 21:06:54] ~ Maxi: Dynamic or static ?
[27.05.24, 21:08:01] ~ Joshua: Dynamic… I think that's what's making it difficult
[27.05.24, 21:09:54] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: Steps to Easily Extract Post IDs:

Navigate to the ads level in Facebook Ads Manager.
Select and preview the ad with the highest number of Facebook comments, then open it.
Click on the post's date, which is clickable.
From the URL, copy the "pfbid" (e.g., facebook.com/brand_name/posts/pfbid13s..............).
Reuse the extracted post ID.
[27.05.24, 23:01:59] ~ Malik: Guys I'd like your advice on something please : 

I have 3 campaigns (2 CBOs and 1 ASC+) for the same product but with different creatives. Some VSLs, some shorter and quicker ads, different hooks... Some days one campaigns works better than the other, sometimes all 3, it really depends. I’m eager to just add all the creatives in one new ASC+ and just have one campaign to simplify everything. What do you think about it ? Do you use a lot of ASC+ ? Thx

[28.05.24, 0:24:49] ~ Matt: Judge always
[28.05.24, 1:44:15] ~ Ignasi: Easier way for regular ads is edit the ad, then under “create ad” replace with “use existing post”. When you do that FB will show the postid next to the creative preview in the left pane. Copy it and discard the edit ‎<This message was edited>
[28.05.24, 6:07:50] ~ Lachy Waldon: anyone know whether customers can see your payment methods after “adding to cart” but before “Checking out"

My ATC rate on shopify is 3x compared to checkout
[28.05.24, 6:28:39] Yaniv: I assume its for new user, I still see it as 299 on my end
[28.05.24, 9:33:35] ~ Sonu Duhra: You can still use Loox but without sending review requests, that’s what it makes so expensive, and use Klaviyo to send out review requests.
[28.05.24, 9:36:37] ~ Sonu Duhra: ASC+ work best right now. I also turned of my retargeting campaigns and have my warm audience included in the ASC+ with 10% cap. ‎<This message was edited>
[28.05.24, 10:42:50] ~ Ignasi: What daily budget?
[28.05.24, 10:42:57] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys curious to know your creative process for analyse part,

I'm currently improving the analysis part

We test over 500 ads a week, here is our actual process:
- We currently report the new winners on a sheet every week
- the good winners we set up a fake comment process under the ad (Facebook only)
- then we dispatch to the creative department to create ad level, translation etc.
- we analyze what worked and what didn't so we can learn from it

Curious about your process?
[28.05.24, 10:53:34] ~ Sonu Duhra: now offseason is not much, but normally we had 1k per market + ABO
[28.05.24, 10:57:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Do you only put the winners in a sheet? Or do you put them all in and give them tiers?
[28.05.24, 10:58:16] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Lets say the losers are not interesting, but BE ads could be improved to winners right.
[28.05.24, 10:58:59] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Only winners yes
[28.05.24, 11:00:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Wouldnt it make more sense to put everything in thats around BE + the winners and give them tiers? C tier = BE -> Note (whats wrong, hook/hold/ctr/cvr) -> Action (improve whats wrong)
[28.05.24, 11:00:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: B tier is profitable but could be better or something like that
[28.05.24, 11:00:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Maybe with 500 ads weekly that it gets a little too much
[28.05.24, 11:23:24] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We analyse all before but is to long actually, but seem good ways to do curious about other
[28.05.24, 11:24:56] ~ Sam O: We only see Caps on Existing customers, how do you put a cap on warm audiences??
[28.05.24, 11:49:39] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes for existing customer you add your retargeting audiences
[28.05.24, 11:50:00] ~ Sam O: Oh I see.... lol

Anyone running subscriptions on Shopify with Stripe? I’m launching subs in Mexico where I have Stripe and Paypal as payment processors, and only Paypal is showing up as option for subscriptions. I wonder if any of you has had the same problem with Shopify subs and Stripe

Thanks!!

[30.05.24, 11:43:26] ~ seth: much more complicated than funnelish

[30.05.24, 12:23:11] ~ G M: Are you doing VSL?
[30.05.24, 12:40:22] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hello Guys, need your help

We have 1 domain where who has a lower page score on Facebook. First week always 0.8 on all new page and after 1 month 1.7-1.9 max 

We tested to run on another domain a test and the page score is 3.2 and another test 3.4

While everything we run on our main domain the page score is 0.8-1.9

We've paid for over 7500 score pages from different providers and no one can get us to unlock the score.


We've trademarked and run on several channels, so we can't open a new domain

Any advice on how to unlock this?

We've already asked an insider and the score page agencies don't understand.
[30.05.24, 13:02:57] ~ Ignasi: Have you tried using another facebook page to advertise?

[30.05.24, 13:40:49] ~ Harout: when you guys run dog pics/positive quotes to lower ad rejection rate for FB ads, does it matter if it's a Page likes/Engagement campaign or a conversion one with a lander in your experience?

[30.05.24, 17:47:43] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: I have just bought yesterday
[30.05.24, 18:23:46] ~ Ignasi: Another option that I’m not sure if it still works is to use a custom conversion for purchases and create a page that is not ecomerce. In theory the surveys didn’t show up. This was like this a year or so ago. I haven’t tried it since so I don’t know if this still works ‎<This message was edited>
[30.05.24, 19:14:29] ~ Sonu Duhra: Is there any upsell app for Shopify that can deal with, not showing offer when customer checks out with other currency then default currency? How does Funnelish handles that? @⁨~Harvey⁩ @⁨~David B⁩

[30.05.24, 19:16:08] ~ Sonu Duhra: So Funnelish has no problems with that?
[30.05.24, 19:16:19] ~ Mukhtar: No problem
[30.05.24, 19:16:32] ~ Mukhtar: We have 3 upsells now there
[30.05.24, 19:26:22] ~ Ignasi: I believe you can do it with aftersell

[30.05.24, 20:19:31] ~ Alessandro Sassi: It's a Shopify limit, no app can fix that unluckily
[30.05.24, 20:21:22] ~ Sonu Duhra: So the only option is to change default currency or Funnelish I guess?
[30.05.24, 20:26:11] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Yeah think so

[30.05.24, 20:57:23] ~ Powa: When did you notice this issue?
[30.05.24, 20:57:37] ~ Ecomcesar: since the new update was release
[30.05.24, 20:57:41] ~ Ecomcesar: about 2 days

[30.05.24, 20:58:14] ~ Ecomcesar: because of failed payments
[30.05.24, 20:58:25] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Data from us last 4 days, we are doing 10k a day: 

2 failed payments on average per day, so we are totally fine after the new update my friend
[30.05.24, 20:58:35] ~ Powa: What is your payment success rate? Mine is 85%
[30.05.24, 21:29:56] ~ Y: Hey guys, anyone facing failed payments or bad authorization rates on Stripe or Funnelish, can message me directly with the acct_ and funnelish account email, I will look into their account and provide any action steps to fix any issues they might face.

Overall, since our update (~ 4 weeks ago) the authorization rates on Stripe improved significantly and our processed volume on stripe with same amount of traffic jumped by 20%+.

If you had auth or 3DS issues in the past with Stripe and are not using Stripe anymore can also reach-out.
[30.05.24, 21:30:53] ~ Y: send me the checkout url pls
[30.05.24, 21:58:59] ~ Zain Ahmed: Any of you guys doing a custom contract with a stripe rep? I got an offer but it doesn’t look good enough to sign
[30.05.24, 22:19:48] Matán Intsuper: @⁨~Qi (Chargeblast)⁩ might be able to connect you if you’re doing over $100k per month
[30.05.24, 22:20:27] ~ Y: If you use funnelish with stripe, and process at least 3M annually, we could get you an offer from Stripe
[30.05.24, 22:22:10] ~ Zain Ahmed: I already got an offer to stripe its like 10 cents a transaction its not really worth thinking about
[30.05.24, 22:23:15] ~ Y: What’s the rate they offered? ‎<This message was edited>
[30.05.24, 22:26:37] ~ Zain Ahmed: Current Rate: 2.9% + $0.30
Fees Paid per transaction: $1.46

Discounted Rate: 2.67% + $0.25 + $0.05 (Radar Fee)
Fees Paid per transaction: $1.36
[30.05.24, 22:27:20] ~ Zain Ahmed: We are on track of processing more than 3M this year
[30.05.24, 22:32:28] ~ Y: if you are not on Stripe already, we could have a better chance of negotiating a 3-month free processing for you + a competitive rate, also depending on where/what you sell.
[30.05.24, 22:33:03] ~ Y: message me your details
[30.05.24, 22:39:09] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thanks for this tips I will try, but I think problem is external to survey
[31.05.24, 3:46:26] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Happy to help connect to our stripe account executive as well - she’s been there for 4 years and has helped several of our clients out
[31.05.24, 9:58:57] ~ Powa: Hi everyone, how do you set up an order confirmation email on Funnelish? Does anyone know someone who can do this for me? I really appreciate any help!
[31.05.24, 12:56:51] ~ seth: the UI is horrible, and if you not have a good dev who understand CC it will cost you a lot of time
[31.05.24, 13:38:52] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Guys selling in Europe, what is your average CTR? I find it hard to get it above 1.25%, average is 0.80% but the ROAS is still great. But I never had like more than 3% CTR
[31.05.24, 13:56:30] ~ Arad Khazabi: on some products pretty much 2.20-2.50% and on other products 4%+ ‎<This message was edited>
[31.05.24, 13:57:42] ~ Maxi: To be honest, we have been scaling with low CTR aswell
[31.05.24, 13:58:11] ~ Maxi: It does not matter, there are no absolutes.

As long as ROAS is good
[31.05.24, 13:58:21] ~ Maxi: You will even get cheaper clicks with lower ctr
[31.05.24, 13:58:26] ~ Arad Khazabi: absolutely agree
[31.05.24, 13:58:35] ~ Arad Khazabi: i had products working with over 2$ CPC
[31.05.24, 13:58:37] Matán Intsuper: You just need to connect it to Shopify and Shopify will send the confirmation email
[31.05.24, 13:58:39] ~ Arad Khazabi: and 1% CTR
[31.05.24, 13:58:46] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Okay thanks guys
[31.05.24, 13:58:50] ~ Maxi: We scale some creatives with 0.3% ctr
[31.05.24, 13:59:00] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Yeah same 😂
[31.05.24, 13:59:06] ~ Erik Pecovnik: With like 0.15 cpc
[31.05.24, 13:59:11] ~ RS: What is your average CPM in US market in beauty niche? Mine is 60-100$ for image ads
[31.05.24, 13:59:14] ~ Maxi: It’s just some guru bs they say
[31.05.24, 13:59:37] ~ Maxi: Image ads should definetly be lower
[31.05.24, 14:00:07] ~ Maxi: You maybe do some clickbait with text etc. So you force high CTR and they make you pay
[31.05.24, 14:00:16] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I thougt ROAS is probably good because of the product itself and if we could like double the CTR would be even crazier
[31.05.24, 14:01:01] ~ Maxi: If you double CTR, what probably will happen is, double CPM & CPC and higher conversion rate.

So it will be the same
[31.05.24, 14:01:15] ~ Maxi: Rather optimize your funnel AOV & CR
[31.05.24, 14:04:18] ~ Ignasi: ^ this!
[31.05.24, 14:07:27] ~ Erik Pecovnik: okay will focus on the AOV, appreciate it
[31.05.24, 14:18:58] ~ Sonu Duhra: In Europe lower CPM = lower CTR. We had Italy 2 Euro CPM and 0.60% CTR but with very good ROAS
[31.05.24, 14:59:40] ~ Malik: For Italy, only CC is enough?
[31.05.24, 15:00:35] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Wow 2 Euro CPM is very good. What makes CPM go that low ?
[31.05.24, 15:01:33] ~ Sonu Duhra: CC?
[31.05.24, 15:01:43] ~ Malik: Crédit card
[31.05.24, 15:01:46] ~ Sonu Duhra: Competition
[31.05.24, 15:02:53] ~ Sonu Duhra: yes for us it did, but probably better with COD, but never tried it.
[31.05.24, 15:03:45] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: You mean low competition? And good creatives too I assume
[31.05.24, 15:07:04] ~ Sonu Duhra: yes also creatives, but you can have the same creative in the US and you pay 50 Euro CPM. So yes lower competition lower CPM
[31.05.24, 15:08:24] ~ Sonu Duhra: and probably also in which niche you are selling in
[31.05.24, 15:13:29] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Makes sense thank you! I was just surprised by Italy having such low CPMs because I have a product running on a low budget in Hungary and CPM is 8-9 Euro. Maybe over time it would also lower
[31.05.24, 15:14:46] ~ Maxi: A GEOs CPM is also affected by its GDP per Capita
[31.05.24, 15:14:59] ~ Maxi: More disposable income = higher cpm
[31.05.24, 15:15:24] ~ Sonu Duhra: 8-9 is still good man. It depends actually on many factors but the main are competition and niche
[31.05.24, 15:15:48] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Great, thanks a lot!
[31.05.24, 15:44:52] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Guys any reason to use checkoutchamp over funnelish?

[1.06.24, 13:06:14] ~ David B: Yeah Harvey nailed it. It has good advantages fpr subscriptions. If you're running consumables eg skincare it might be a good play. But in house dev seems to be a must.

[2.06.24, 20:01:04] ~ RS: Guys who live in Phuket, what is the best area to live in Phuket? Where are the most Europeans, richer people etc.
[2.06.24, 20:13:05] ~ Rick: ‎This message was deleted.
[2.06.24, 21:52:59] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Simprosys is the best - paid but really cheap

2nd option- google and youtube app , free but not ideal for multiple countries 

3rd option is manual feed - not recommended because it won't be dynamic. You will have to keep maintaining a lot feeds

This one seems to be able to do it, yay.
[3.06.24, 7:23:16] ~ Lachy Waldon: Top one is US, we just have viral creatives and it makes CPMS dirt cheap
[3.06.24, 11:07:37] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Can someone connect me with Romanian accountant? 🇷🇴
[3.06.24, 11:10:31] ~ Facundo: hey guys, anyone doing COD here?
[3.06.24, 11:21:11] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Me
[3.06.24, 11:33:47] Topi: Anyone have proven agency to get your brand published in magazines? Would appriciate connection
[3.06.24, 12:09:38] ~ Alexander Sundström: I have a supplier in china and their system does not support funnelish. The products are customized, is there a way to sync funnelish to Shopify? Or any other solution you might suggest?
[3.06.24, 12:09:57] Topi: Yeah just press intergrations
[3.06.24, 12:10:01] Topi: connect your shopify to funnelish
[3.06.24, 12:10:10] ~ Alexander Sundström: Oh, that simple :)
[3.06.24, 12:10:12] ~ Alexander Sundström: Thanks
[3.06.24, 12:10:13] Topi: Then with product when you create it in funnelish
[3.06.24, 12:10:16] Topi: Just click “create automation”
[3.06.24, 12:10:24] Topi: and map it to sync with shopify
[3.06.24, 12:10:32] ~ Chris Koh: @⁨~Kike 🚀⁩
[3.06.24, 12:10:43] ~ Alexander Sundström: Perfect! I got worried for nothing again :)
[3.06.24, 12:10:48] ~ Alexander Sundström: Thank you!
[3.06.24, 12:10:59] Topi: If you have multiple order bumps / upsell, do not forget to “enable bundling” and add like 15 minutes time for there. Also we use “over ride price” as well as track quantity
[3.06.24, 12:11:37] ~ Alexander Sundström: I appreciate your quick response!
[3.06.24, 15:05:43] Topi: Anyone using checkout champ together with shopify store and cart?
[3.06.24, 16:53:39] ~ Joshua: What do you guys use for tracking? last month Facebook only tracked 70% of purchases
[3.06.24, 17:39:47] ~ Wouter Akika: I recommend Converge, they are great, inexpensive vs hyros and allow you to track 95-99% of sales in the facebook ads manager directly
[3.06.24, 17:41:40] ~ Mark: wetracked.io can definitely help you with this
[3.06.24, 17:48:14] ~ Robert Gonzalez: How much is Converge? They dont have the price on their website :/
[3.06.24, 17:53:06] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I use Triple Whale 🐳 works great for me
‎[3.06.24, 17:54:30] ~ Alex Noghreh: ‎image omitted
[3.06.24, 18:03:03] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Triple whale is arguably one of the best options atm from what we are seeing on our end. Hyros is great too but a bit expensive. Free other options would be - UTMs , Google Analytics and Tags manager. A bit technical to setup but worth collecting the data
[3.06.24, 18:05:28] ~ Joshua: Giving wetracked a try… didn't plan on happening on the most expensive to start
[3.06.24, 18:35:57] ~ Shay Sabag: ‎~ María Clara Busca-Sust added ~ Shay Sabag
[3.06.24, 18:26:56] ~ Mark: It is super good for reading data and other functionalities, but it does not send data back to ad platforms, and so the platforms have less data to optimise your ads and target / retarget the right people
[3.06.24, 19:35:01] ~ Mikael: Does anyone have a Shopify insider? Our stores are getting closed down for some random policy violations which makes no sence.
Or anyone that might be able to help or have been in the same situation? ‎<This message was edited>
[3.06.24, 19:37:41] ~ AJ: Fellas, is anyone experiencing sea shipping delays? Shipped out mid April from China and it still hasn't arrived to port of LA. What's going on?
[3.06.24, 19:57:07] Amit Wadhawan: Do wetracked or hyros send the data back to the ad platform?
[3.06.24, 20:01:52] ~ Bony Ghadiya: I agree, but what we usually do is collect data on Google Analytics and/or Tags Manager and send it back!
[3.06.24, 20:02:09] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Hyros does. Not sure about wetracked
[3.06.24, 20:02:45] ~ Bony Ghadiya: pls dm me full info, we can look into it
[3.06.24, 20:06:15] Amit Wadhawan: Ok cool. Thanks!
[3.06.24, 20:32:01] ~ Mark: Yes it does
[3.06.24, 20:36:53] ~ Nils: Lachy would love to speak with you more about these types of viral creatives
[3.06.24, 20:56:28] ~ Mikael: Any woocommerce expert here or anyone who run their store on woocommerce?
[3.06.24, 21:43:32] ~ Alex Noghreh: Does switching over to agency account help improved the CPM’s / CPC’s ?
[3.06.24, 21:44:08] ~ L: It didn't for us
[3.06.24, 21:44:11] ~ L: Only thing that helped was focusing on creative
[3.06.24, 21:48:04] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Same here!
[3.06.24, 21:55:02] Amit Wadhawan: +1
[3.06.24, 21:55:06] ~ Nils: For those of you who are successful with advertorials, do you do video ad -> Advertorial page -> cart -> checkout?

Or do you do landing page/product page as well. 

Essentially how do you like to structure the funnel if you run advertorials
[3.06.24, 21:58:40] ~ Richie: Advertorial-> sales page (regular product page when testing) -> checkout page
[3.06.24, 22:06:27] ~ Nils: thank you!
[4.06.24, 0:19:45] ~ David B: Hey guys. The Copy call is on tomorrow.

3pm UK time / 10am EST. 

I've heard through the grape vine, a few of you might be struggling with writing ad scripts. 

Join me tomorrow and I'll share some of my formulas that make it a lot easier and we'll come up with some hooks for your videos live on the call. 

PLUS!

I have some insanely good examples of pages to share to give you some inspo! 

See you on the call TOMORROW!
[4.06.24, 4:06:27] ~ Joshua: When you guys have to scale down, what's the most aggressive you can be without completely ruining the ads?
[4.06.24, 5:15:42] ~ Santi Roa: Just set a different standard of performance and kill everything under that
[4.06.24, 5:16:08] ~ Santi Roa: Then optimize on a lower CAC, kill ads earlier, launch less, be more strict with your spent
[4.06.24, 5:17:08] ~ Santi Roa: If you typically cut ads at $60 no purchase, start doing it at $40. And aim to lower CAC. This will undoubtedly reduce scale
[4.06.24, 8:20:18] ~ Zain Ahmed: Anyone funnelish users getting a ton of 400 errors through paypal API?

[4.06.24, 14:10:28] ~ Malik: Hi guys
[4.06.24, 14:10:39] ~ Malik: For the guys running ASC+ campaigns at high spend per day
[4.06.24, 14:11:10] ~ Malik: Do you add all the awareness stage in the same ASC+ ? I heard it might be good
[4.06.24, 14:11:24] ~ Malik: From top of funnel to bottom of funnel
[4.06.24, 14:11:33] ~ Malik: videos + images ads all in the same campaign

[4.06.24, 23:03:50] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: Are there ways to pay them on the platform itself? Or do you reccomend a different processor?

[5.06.24, 14:33:40] ~ Malik: Hi guys, I need help to get in touch with FB Support. Do you have an email please ? 
My real FB profile got blocked for no reason (Or maybe because I used a VPN)
I sent my ID card, my passport and did the Selfie thing but the bots keep refusing my application
[5.06.24, 14:33:58] ~ Malik: I have a ticket ID and I would like to speak with a real human as it is my real profile that I have for more than 10 years now
[5.06.24, 14:34:07] ~ Malik: Can someone help please ?
[5.06.24, 14:41:49] Topi: In my experience they do absolutely nothing, you should rely on insider but it might be costly. +2000 for unban. If you need one, please reach out, have several.  @⁨~Malik⁩
[5.06.24, 14:42:38] ~ Malik: I did use an insider one time and it worked but my profil was restricted from advertising. Now it's complete BS lol

[5.06.24, 17:31:05] ~ Nils: hey man! from my experience agencies have never been able to perform as good as our inhouse creatives, but maybe other people have seen different results

[5.06.24, 17:32:43] ~ Nils: ahh gotcha makes sense
[5.06.24, 17:33:05] ~ Sonu Duhra: We had somebody posting but the account is not growing

[5.06.24, 17:33:59] ~ Nils: but from what ive heard its tough to grow organically
[5.06.24, 17:34:30] ~ Nils: we get a lot of organic followers through our conversion ads just because of our scale and impresssions

Can I really sign up on the link for this service?
[5.06.24, 19:46:14] Alex  Fedotoff: Hi @⁨~Mercédesz Lajos⁩ yeah those are pretty basic websites :) but good enough to sell in less competitive markets. The delivery is usually taking few minutes, we use software to make them on a scale
[5.06.24, 20:00:03] ~ Mike Ramsey: Hey All -

On today’s payment call, I am going to review KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) compliance processes that payment providers are mandating and becoming more strict on.  Global regulatory environment is tightening in 2024 and things that worked in the past don’t work any more; particularly for fast scaling ecomm biz.  

I had a chance to attend a risk / fraud payments webinar with some compliance execs at companies such as PayPal, Stripe and Airwallex so can give you all the inside track on what they are looking for so you can prevent your accounts from getting disrupted.

You are invited to a Zoom webinar.
When: Jun 5, 2024 04:00 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)
Topic: Payment Processing - BBA & ESS - Michael Ramsey

[6.06.24, 10:15:20] Radek: I think your problem starts in creative. CTR to CTR outbound drop is too high, which from my experience means click bait or irrelevant hook. This usually results in low CR.

[6.06.24, 12:48:54] ~ Alex Noghreh: We have a BM that we used in past. Haven’t used it in 9 months till last week. Rebranded a company with new domain, IG and FB fan page. Started it up again last week and our CPC CPM are sky high. Thinking about getting a new BM and fresh pixel and starting from scratch or going to an agency account. $10 CPC isn’t sustainable for us. Curious to know what thoughts are. If we get a new BM I’m assuming will need new llc , domain , bank account info , IG and FB page. Complete pain in the ass. Theoretically switching to agency would be easier and avoid having to take the above mentioned measures.
[6.06.24, 14:28:49] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Our advantage+ sales campaign w 1 promo ad for 65% off is doing nicely - how do you guys do promo campaigns for sales promotions? Seperate campaign or load ads into your standard BOD ad sets/campaigns

[7.06.24, 4:07:21] ~ Gedion: Hey guys does anyone have a Shopify insider? Or a way to accelerate add account ban/disabling?

 I got a random ban for not following whatever adv policy.. which has never happened before. I’m in the reviewing process now, but want to get on with it asap, and not loose the add acc
[7.06.24, 4:07:32] ~ Gedion: Anybody know what to do ?
[7.06.24, 8:12:30] ~ Lachy Waldon: Anyone ever had this happen:

Was operating on a new stripe account duue to shopify and old stripe getting paused. 

My stripe account get banned after using for 2 days ( a little over 10k in it)

Now stripe have emailed to say they’re gonna refund all the payments to customers as they were unauthorised. 

So i’ve already shipped these orders out and our cogs are high.

They were all completely authorised and they purchased through my site. Our brands been operating for 6 months. Bit of a fucked situation
[7.06.24, 8:16:23] ~ Firass: Yes, it actually happened to me last week. Also because of „unauthorized“ payments and they now refunded like 20% of the balance amount. I am still trying to get that shit fixed…
[7.06.24, 8:17:31] ~ Mikael: This sounds like a nightmare… is there anyway to prevent these kind of "unauthorized payments"?
[7.06.24, 8:18:03] ~ Firass: All orders are also fulfilled btw so yeah will see how I can get the money back that is left but the account probably is gone for sure
[7.06.24, 8:19:38] ~ Firass: tbh I dont really think its because of an „unauthorized payment“ but more of a scaling reason so its most likely you get your account banned if you scale too hard within a couple of days like out of nowhere
[7.06.24, 8:20:10] ~ Mikael: man w t f... yea this sucks. how are you gono scale a seasonal store than..
[7.06.24, 8:20:13] ~ Firass: stripe just gives you any reason so they can legitimize there action steps
[7.06.24, 8:21:21] ~ Firass: seasonal is tricky but probably the best way is to warm up the account with at least some sales until season starts
[7.06.24, 8:30:44] ~ Lachy Waldon: the other stripe account i was using was 4 years old and i had never had an issue and then all of a sudden they banned that as well
[7.06.24, 8:32:36] ~ Firass: they are ruthless with these things like they dont really give a f how long you been operating with them
[7.06.24, 8:33:25] ~ Firass: best solution is always to have a different payment processor which is not Stripe that you can get in place when things like that happen
[7.06.24, 9:38:10] ~ Erik Pecovnik: good apps for A/B price testing?
[7.06.24, 9:39:30] Topi: Intelligems but expensive  @⁨~Erik Pecovnik⁩
[7.06.24, 9:39:59] Topi: If youre doing volume its good, price testing can have big impact
[7.06.24, 9:42:51] ~ Erik Pecovnik: will use that free trial
[7.06.24, 9:44:06] ~ Erik Pecovnik: not such a big volume, 5-7k/day but we make product ourself so its hard to put a price on it
[7.06.24, 10:55:07] Topi: Hey guys anyone in bali?
[7.06.24, 10:57:30] ~ Kamal: Will be there in 2 weeks

[7.06.24, 12:43:11] ~ Erik Pecovnik: where do you guys find trending songs without scrolling
[7.06.24, 14:44:55] ~ Gedion: ?
[7.06.24, 15:50:39] ~ P: Someone who has a creative strategist ?
[7.06.24, 18:40:25] ~ Mikael: anyone who can help? we launched stripe today. We got 1 order, they asked us to verify identidy which we did. then right after they told us they will close our account Because of too many high risk orders going trought without verication? (we got 1 order)
[7.06.24, 18:42:36] ~ Y: Check if you have not been hit by card testing bots! Those could cost you your stripe account easily without noticing!
[7.06.24, 18:42:50] ~ Mikael: whats card testing bots?
[7.06.24, 18:47:20] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: how to avoid?
[7.06.24, 18:47:36] ~ Y: Fraudsters use your stripe page to test stolen card numbers until the find the right cvc number! Usually they send thousands of requests on short period of time and it’s hard to see them as stripe doesn’t show failed api calls except under developer logs
[7.06.24, 18:49:37] ~ Mikael: can you see this in transactions? Because there arnt any transactions showing this
[7.06.24, 18:50:03] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: I think I am seing something exactly like this through shopify payments currently is there a way to avoid this?
[7.06.24, 18:50:39] ~ Y: https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-prevent-card-testing-attacks?locale=en-GB

In the past weve seen these in our platform then we had to implement rate limiting and some verifications to prevent them, 

If you are seeing that issue then you could add captcha using cloudflare to your domain, or simply contact the platform to stop it, it’s the responsibility of the platform
[7.06.24, 18:51:15] ~ Y: Weird 😐 i think shopify might have good filters against them but in case it doesn’t get to their support when you see that happening
[7.06.24, 18:53:17] ~ Y: Go to developers > logs that’s the only place to see them then filter by failed POST requests.

If you are using funnelish, it’s easy to detect, just pay attention to any sudden spikes in purchase attempts, usually the attack lasts 20mins max!
[7.06.24, 18:55:09] ~ Y: The good news is, if stripe had banned you in the past due to this (they will not tell/confirm to you , you will have to find out yourself!

You can appeal it, then stripe risk team would ask you to confirm what you have done to avoid that happening again, if you did what the recommend here https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-prevent-card-testing-attacks?locale=en-GB or similar, they will reinstate your account.

[7.06.24, 19:03:41] ~ Mikael: Can someone help? this feels impossible atm lol. 1 sell and the account shuts down
[7.06.24, 19:13:49] ~ Y: Click on status and filter by failed! If its a bot you would see hundreds of those 400 ERR within a short timeframe
‎[7.06.24, 19:22:36] ~ Mikael: ‎image omitted
[7.06.24, 19:31:31] ~ Y: Then card testing bot was not the cause! Try appeal the ban
[7.06.24, 19:32:11] ~ Mikael: They want tons of evidence of shit I dont have Because this Company is new and we got 1 sell lol
[7.06.24, 19:32:45] ~ Y: Lol i know maybe they thought you were someone else
[7.06.24, 19:33:06] ~ Mikael: yeah maybe. As I am not the owner. the owner lives in China
[7.06.24, 19:33:08] ~ Y: Or you had some past shady dealings with them
[7.06.24, 19:33:51] ~ Y: They should try airwallex stripe hates when the owner is abroad with no local rep
[7.06.24, 19:34:44] ~ Mikael: hmm
[7.06.24, 19:35:39] ~ Mikael: we have Airwallex but airwallex dont have clearpay/afterpay, Does airwallex have integration to funnelish?
[7.06.24, 19:43:33] ~ Y: Yes it’s invite only atm send your details to our team and will add you to the invite list
[7.06.24, 19:44:31] ~ Y: Airwallex can be a good backup but stripe has better auth rates if you can keep an account
[7.06.24, 19:44:46] ~ Mikael: if I can start an account xD
[7.06.24, 22:36:59] ~ Mikael: Anyone know how and if stripe are strict with device logging in, ips etc? Especially when verifying ir creating account
[8.06.24, 3:26:28] ~ Farhat Godil: Any contacts that could help get my merchant center revived. They suspended me for misrepresenting but I am not sure what I am doing wrong: have been using that account past 4 years
[8.06.24, 5:47:18] ~ Zain Ahmed: Does anyone have tiktok shop insider?
[8.06.24, 10:11:54] ~ Lachy Waldon: whos using airwallex to accept payments hree?
[8.06.24, 10:19:29] Topi: Pm
‎[8.06.24, 11:01:22] ~ Alessandro Sassi: ‎image omitted
[8.06.24, 12:30:55] ~ G M: No problem, is not the common ban restriction
[8.06.24, 13:17:42] ~ Mikael: Are stripe okey with a UK business and the owner is chinese? Or is this high risk to them? Does anyone know?
[8.06.24, 15:09:23] ~ Y: It counts as a risk factor, but still doable if you keep the account clean, home website being legitimate, avoid aggressive scaling, try to get an account manager as soon as the volume justifies it…etc
[8.06.24, 15:16:50] ~ Mikael: Well. The sub account got banned after 1 sell and sttaight after id verification they banned
[8.06.24, 15:17:10] ~ Mikael: Would it count better if a swede or spanish person is the owner of the UK company?
[8.06.24, 15:49:38] ~ Mikael: Have anyone experienced payment provider bans? And how did you resolve them?
[8.06.24, 16:15:04] ~ Y: I’ve seen another merchant, Italian with a US LLC getting banned similarly, generally Airwallex is more open to foreign owned entities as i said before especially Chinese/HK/SG.
[8.06.24, 17:12:55] ~ Alessandro: Airwallex works also with an uk or USA company?
[8.06.24, 18:15:19] ~ Davi: Has anyone ever experienced issues with the Funnelish to Shopify integration? In my case, the orders are imported correctly. However, I notice that Shopify analytics are not being reported accurately. The conversion rate is incorrect, and the same issue occurs with the sessions (the domain used on Funnelish is a subdomain of the one on Shopify). Is this a common problem, or is there an error in my integration?
[8.06.24, 18:23:32] ~ Y: Sessions and similar cannot be imported to shopify we only import orders
[8.06.24, 18:24:01] ~ Y: As far as i know they launched recently in the US not sure about the UK
[8.06.24, 18:47:30] Topi: Anyone has lots of experiene with native ads? Started recently, are already spending decent, +10k day, would love to ask few questions how these platfroms behave usually
[8.06.24, 18:47:47] Topi: Taboola, outbrain, baiduu

Let’s see
[8.06.24, 18:54:25] ~ Mike Ramsey: They work with both US and UK
[8.06.24, 22:17:36] ~ Santi Roa: Started recently with an Agency

[8.06.24, 23:35:04] ~ Mukhtar: Dm me
[9.06.24, 1:22:12] Matán Intsuper: Have you tried talking with an outbrain rep ?
[9.06.24, 2:10:59] ~ Zain Ahmed: interested as well
[9.06.24, 10:23:02] Topi: Hey matan, yeah we do have reps for all platforms. They are somewhat helpful, our media buyer is in weekly calls with them.
[9.06.24, 10:37:46] ~ Mukhtar: Hey, do you guys work with any casting agencies in the US? ‎<This message was edited>
[9.06.24, 12:56:50] ~ Arad Khazabi: how do you guys a/b test advertorials?
[9.06.24, 12:57:08] ~ Mikael: Anyone worked with these before or similur? https://remoove.agency/
[9.06.24, 12:57:09] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Funnelish 50/50 split
[9.06.24, 12:57:22] ~ Arad Khazabi: what about the campaign structure on facebook?
[9.06.24, 12:57:41] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Keep it the same, the URL stays the same with split testing on funnelish
[9.06.24, 12:57:55] ~ Jeremy Leppink: It redirects
[9.06.24, 12:57:59] ~ Arad Khazabi: gotcha, its fine when i use pagebuilder? + i have 3 advertorials to a/b test
[9.06.24, 12:58:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You mean like pagefly?
[9.06.24, 12:58:20] ~ Arad Khazabi: yea exactly
[9.06.24, 12:58:47] ~ Jeremy Leppink: With pagefly its a little different i believe, but there should be some apps for Shopify where you can split test
[9.06.24, 12:59:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So you dont have to make seperate adsets or campaigns for split testing
[9.06.24, 12:59:15] ~ Arad Khazabi: okay thanks brother, appreciate
[9.06.24, 13:00:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Not sure if this app helps but try and search AB test Trident on Shopify app store
[9.06.24, 13:00:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Might be only for price split test but not sure
[9.06.24, 14:09:52] ~ Sonu Duhra: check Intelligems
[9.06.24, 16:10:12] ~ Allan L: Hey boys.
Finaly got the EIN number for my US LLC.
Now moving on, I need to setup a bank account for the company and adding my partner to the LLC.

Any suggestions for those tasks here? :)
[9.06.24, 16:12:33] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: For bank account I’d recommend Mercury, works great for me
[9.06.24, 16:52:21] ~ Jacobo Uribe: A/B Convert or Intelligems if you're on Shopify brother
[9.06.24, 17:15:04] ~ Allan L: Will have a look, Thanks.
[10.06.24, 0:57:25] ~ Yusuf: i use vwo.com for split testing on shopify
[10.06.24, 12:49:27] ~ Kevin Krieg: we do too, its really good
[10.06.24, 16:34:38] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: how does it compare to intelligems
[10.06.24, 17:11:07] ~ Erik Pecovnik: and you can pick a specific product and test only price?
[10.06.24, 20:17:06] ~ Yusuf Business: never used intelligems but free plan has always been enough for me in vwo and it’s pretty easy to use
[10.06.24, 20:18:26] ~ Yusuf Business: yes, you can do split url tests, you can create extra product on shopify and do it that way

It saves cookies, so if person goes to the same page from same device again, will see the same price as last time

when i do price tests, I remove the prices in collections
[10.06.24, 20:34:01] ~ Jacobo Uribe: If you wanna do price tests, A/B convert is the cheapest option ($49/mo whereas Intelligems only offers price testing at their $499/mo plan)
[10.06.24, 20:34:13] ~ Jacobo Uribe: + it doesn't work in a URL split format which IMO is cleaner
[10.06.24, 20:44:36] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Thanks this information was much needed
[10.06.24, 21:44:57] Yaniv: Price test is actually $2000/monthly
[10.06.24, 21:49:11] ~ Gabriel B ♠️: Do
You know if this app let's you play with multiple discount codes? For example:

BOGOFREE Vs BOGO50%Off?
[10.06.24, 23:17:19] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: ‎‪+63 994 610 9401‬ removed ~ Matteo Pellegrini
[11.06.24, 8:41:51] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: Guys some days, we do like 40% margins like today and some day we do like 5%, so I tried to scale ads mid day today and it might have worked as CPA stayed the same anyone knows if scale surfing is working on fb as well?
[11.06.24, 9:40:18] ~ Malik: I do that quite often when Roas is high before 10am and it works
[11.06.24, 9:42:46] ~ Mikael: How much do you usually scale with?
[11.06.24, 10:20:16] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: can you explain your process of scaling?
[11.06.24, 10:51:35] ~ Lachy Waldon: sick of shopify, what’s everyone else using as alternatives?
[11.06.24, 10:53:03] ~ RS: What is wrong?
[11.06.24, 10:55:26] ~ Malik: I double the budget and see how it goes. If it stays profitable I might double again at like 4PM then at midnight I go back to the initial budget or 50% higher.
[11.06.24, 10:55:43] ~ Malik: But I need to see a high ROAS in the morning
[11.06.24, 10:58:13] Bob: Is this on an A+ campaign or something different?
[11.06.24, 10:59:05] ~ Lachy Waldon: we’ve got close to 300k on hold with them for no reason and we can’t use shopify payments anymore
[11.06.24, 11:00:24] ~ RS: You should talk with Michael Ramsey about payment processors. He will help you
[11.06.24, 11:03:07] ~ Lachy Waldon: thanks bro
[11.06.24, 11:16:09] ~ Mukhtar: How many campaigns do you have
[11.06.24, 11:17:05] ~ Mukhtar: What do you do if the roas is not good before 10am
[11.06.24, 11:18:58] ~ Malik: I don't surf
[11.06.24, 11:19:16] ~ Malik: I have a lot of campaigns and it's a mix of CBOs and ASC+
[11.06.24, 11:22:10] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: so you don’t touch the budgets at all or you lower them
[11.06.24, 13:21:32] ~ Santi Roa: What volume are you doing with this fluctuations?
[11.06.24, 13:25:54] ~ Santi Roa: It's super common, but you should aim to close that gap between great days and bad days. I believe it can be different things
1) Competition. If you are in a very competitive niche with lots of competitors, and everyone is doing kinda the same thing, it can be part of why this happens.

2) Media buying strategy: you might have a non solid strategy that's messing up the algorithm by changing too many things, or bidding for the same people accross accounts/campaigns

3) Creatives and offer: if this is not good enough, you might have days where Fb can reach the ideal audience that matches your creatives and days that they don't. For this, you should diversify angles/creative styles, actor demographics, etc
[11.06.24, 14:11:55] ~ Erik Pecovnik: do you guys add new creatives into active CBO?
[11.06.24, 14:12:26] ~ RS: All the time. Testing creatives in ABOs, and winner creatives duplicate into scaling CBO’s
[11.06.24, 14:13:18] ~ L: How’s the CBO structured? Do you have 1 adset for each ad ?
[11.06.24, 14:13:52] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I have 5 broad adsets with same creatives in all of the adsets
[11.06.24, 14:14:16] ~ Erik Pecovnik: so there are just 5 adset copies
[11.06.24, 14:14:31] ~ RS: Some of my CBO’s have 1 adset with over 10 ads in it. Some CBO’s have 5 adsets. I always have multiple ads inside adsets
[11.06.24, 14:14:57] ~ Erik Pecovnik: so when you have CBO with 5 adsets, and add new creative, you add it in all 5 adsets right?
[11.06.24, 14:15:13] ~ RS: Yep
[11.06.24, 14:15:20] ~ Erik Pecovnik: okay thanks
[11.06.24, 14:15:54] ~ RS: You just rotate in New ads periodically and turn off bad working ads from your adsets. This is how you keep consistant results
[11.06.24, 14:16:23] ~ Erik Pecovnik: in my case is that one ad that is super winner have all the spend
[11.06.24, 14:16:38] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I should probably create CBO without this ad
[11.06.24, 14:17:01] ~ RS: Thats good. Performance will drop for this ad eventually and FB starts spending on other ads that it thinks its good
[11.06.24, 15:06:18] ~ Yusuf Business: Do you have just one scaling cbo in this case or having multiple for each selling angle etc. ?
[11.06.24, 15:13:43] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: have tried this but new creatives almost never pick up budget, we have tried also min ad set budget within a CBO but this didn’t work as well, so now we doing ABO and then move into CBO.
[11.06.24, 15:14:14] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: not much 50-100k per month in this period
[11.06.24, 15:15:00] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: what’s your strategy for media buying and creatives?
[11.06.24, 17:20:05] ~ Santi Roa: Ok, I also think that at this revenue it is common to see fluctuations. You will have to look at groups of 3 days for example, to have a better understanding of performance
[11.06.24, 17:20:51] ~ Santi Roa: Try to group by 3, 7, 15 days, and see patterns this way. If you see that all the 3 day groups are consistent in general, then start looking and worrying about it in that way. If it's 7, then use 7 instead
[11.06.24, 17:21:19] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: how do you test creatives mate? What budget, how do you decide on winners or killing an ad, how much time you give them?

[11.06.24, 18:54:17] Matán Intsuper: Maybe wise
[11.06.24, 18:57:43] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I use Nord VPN, they’re the best IMO. It’s not the cheapest option but the quality is excellent. I’ve heard of people using Proton VPN too, it’s free for Mac and IOS

Also make sure the phone where they post from is reseted to factory settings. It won’t work otherwise, I got a new phone just for this lol
[11.06.24, 19:01:14] ~ Zain Ahmed: Oh thats an interesting thing to try
[11.06.24, 19:06:39] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: For sure, you definitely should because otherwise TT will detect that they’re in their countries and push the content there. Just using a VPN is not enough for it

[11.06.24, 20:54:44] ~ Mike Ramsey: You need to apply for an ITIN - takes 10 weeks to get it

[12.06.24, 0:34:24] Matán Intsuper: In person in the USA or using an agency in your home country ‎<This message was edited>

Cause in the past I’ve try with a xiaomi and was not working
With an iPhone is working

[12.06.24, 13:03:56] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Yes MP
[12.06.24, 13:04:52] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Anyone now how to de shadow ban domain for tik tok account?

We are banned instantly for each tik tok ads account that we open
[12.06.24, 15:40:10] ~ Malik: Hey guys, did some of you not use Funnelish but directly build Advertorials on Shopify ? With Gempage, PageFly or any page builders?
[12.06.24, 15:40:30] ~ Malik: I will test to do that and would like to know if some of you have tested it too. Thank you
[12.06.24, 15:53:40] ~ Allan L: We did a test. But split testing and stuff is much harder. + you need external tracking software
‎[12.06.24, 16:22:11] ~ L: ‎image omitted
[12.06.24, 16:48:21] Topi: Guys VSL call going live in 15. (10:00am - EST)

Let’s make it as good as last time.

Today some of you sent me crazy good VSLs 1on1. Nice work. 

Join here ---> https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FSRGS4DcTFiyUObhYScC_g
[12.06.24, 17:27:00] ~ Yusuf: i did from theitin.com didn't need to send passport and process was smooth, i had 50 usd off code, START50
[12.06.24, 17:27:37] ~ Allan L: How Long did the process take?
[12.06.24, 17:27:52] ~ Yusuf: i think around 2-3 months but not sure
[12.06.24, 17:27:57] ~ Yusuf: it's been a while
[12.06.24, 17:28:59] ~ Allan L: Arh okay
[12.06.24, 17:30:00] ~ Yusuf: actually i first did with gempages, then tested funnelish, had better performance with gempages and kept that running
[12.06.24, 17:32:23] ~ Malik: crazy
[12.06.24, 17:32:33] ~ Malik: Thx for the answer
[12.06.24, 17:32:35] Matán Intsuper: I did it personally in IRS offices in Miami. It took about 2 weeks to get the ITIN. You need to file a personal tax form with 0 profits.
[12.06.24, 17:38:58] ~ Sonu Duhra: I also use Gempages, you now can even create a complete sales funnel with Gempages new feature, didn’t tried that yet @⁨~Malik⁩
[12.06.24, 17:40:35] ~ Erik Pecovnik: And checkout by shopify?
[12.06.24, 17:40:55] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes
[12.06.24, 17:54:17] ~ L: How do you guys track the advertorial cr?
[12.06.24, 18:02:45] ~ Sonu Duhra: With Clarity and Intelligems
[12.06.24, 18:08:04] ~ Facundo: hi guys, just by chance, does anyone know a cosmetic lab in mexico?
[12.06.24, 18:08:38] ~ lengjoo: has anyone submitted a PCI DSS document to Stripe before?
[12.06.24, 18:55:21] ~ Nils: Yo guys! We are looking to hire a person/agency that has experience in putting together offers. Like creating bundles, digital products, funnels etc.

If you recommend someone we end up hiring we can pay you $ amount or consulting call :)
[12.06.24, 19:07:35] ~ EasyGloss (Anela): Hi Nils, happy to do that for you! I have a conversion rate optimization background and the biggest part is building offers that sell! as well as high converting product pages, checkout pages, funnels, ads, etc. Let's chat!
[12.06.24, 22:09:38] ~ Harout: what kind of employee benefits have worked great for you to boost motivation/productivity? or any other practices for culture building
[12.06.24, 22:48:35] ~ Zain Ahmed: i feel like our VA’s arent receptive to incentivizing performance. We offer a small performance bonus but honestly i think the best thing is just making their job easier with SOP’s
[13.06.24, 7:51:30] ~ Mikael: Is it safe to export ALL products and import them to a new store which is owned by another email and another company? 

Or will shopify automatic recognize and suspend the store for copying?
[13.06.24, 7:51:52] ~ Mikael: Have anyone experienced this or is all good?
[13.06.24, 8:27:50] René Crooijmans: Hi guys - how can I track the conversion of my advertorial when using Shopify?
[13.06.24, 8:30:44] René Crooijmans: Always used Funnelish up to this point
[13.06.24, 9:15:08] René Crooijmans: Adding a 14th week of salary every quarter if quarterly KPI is met. You’re basically offering the same incentive as a 13th month but devided over the year, so you keep a consistent flow of motivation
[13.06.24, 9:24:17] René Crooijmans: Recently been experimenting with giving new VA’s a base salary and a performance based salary too. Let’s say they ask for $10 per hour, I’ll offer them 60-80% of that as their base salary. They’ll get the other 40-20% if they met their KPI over the past 2 weeks
[13.06.24, 10:01:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I did this when i was general dropshipping to duplicate my store to multiple countries, i used Shopify shark (external Chrome extensenion) never had issues with it
[13.06.24, 12:18:48] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone here knows where to get a good creditline? Its on a dutch company
[13.06.24, 12:33:27] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: Has anyone used a Shopify Expert before? We’re having issues with a slow site speed, and they’ve quoted us $1K to fix it. This seems a bit high but I’ve never used a Shopify expert before so maybe it’s not?
[13.06.24, 12:39:01] Topi: We use regular dev and cost $100 and done in few hours.
[13.06.24, 12:39:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: i can send you one, getting your page speed done perfectly
[13.06.24, 12:39:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: for 25 bucks
[13.06.24, 12:39:48] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: yes please! that would be amazing
[13.06.24, 12:39:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: not done in a few hours though, will take aprox 24 to max 48
[13.06.24, 12:40:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: hours*
[13.06.24, 12:40:22] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: That’s fine, as long as it gets fixed

[13.06.24, 13:58:42] ~ Powa: Hey guys, Alex often mentions the gethook ads library, which I believe is similar to Foreplay. I couldn't find the website URL for GetHook. Does anyone know it?
[13.06.24, 13:59:20] ~ RS: https://www.gethookd.ai/gethookd
[13.06.24, 14:01:33] ~ Powa: Thank you!

[13.06.24, 15:49:05] ~ Arad Khazabi: to be honest, ill always hired someone from fivver for like 50 bucks and that worked great
[13.06.24, 15:49:18] ~ Arad Khazabi: unfortunally not forever. needs to be refreshed every now an then
[13.06.24, 15:49:20] ~ Arad Khazabi: and*
[13.06.24, 15:55:37] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: ok thanks. I’m working with a guy from Fiverr now. I’m so glad I asked because $950 seems insane for a small project like this.
[13.06.24, 17:25:01] ~ Arad Khazabi: Yea lmao that’s way to much
[13.06.24, 20:13:45] ~ L: For those who work with advertorials using page builders (gempages or pagefly) how do you split test an advertorial? Do you use any app?
[13.06.24, 20:22:06] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I think ABConvert is good for split testing
[14.06.24, 3:15:59] René Crooijmans: For those who use advertorials and Shopify, how do you track the ctr of your advertorial?
[14.06.24, 11:26:39] ~ Sonu Duhra: You can do a URL AB test with Intelligems and choose objective CTR
[14.06.24, 12:10:57] ~ Viktor Metodiev: Based on several thousand split-tests, I’d only choose Convert or VWO and only optimize for CVR/RPV
[14.06.24, 12:16:35] René Crooijmans: Thanks - will test this out
[14.06.24, 15:07:48] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Waddupp guys, 

anybody has a decent copywriter to recommend who knows about advertorials, is very good in writing things kindergarten simple and knows what he or she is doing?
[14.06.24, 15:50:17] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I have a guy a decent guy who works for me and build structure for landing pages and does copywriting + email
[14.06.24, 17:11:46] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Guys anyone used captions.ai for AI spokeperson? How does it perform
[14.06.24, 17:27:53] ~ Ecomcesar: Not bad but recommend rask
[14.06.24, 17:28:00] ~ Ecomcesar: Performs better
[14.06.24, 17:51:37] ~ Gedion: Guys what is good Clarity drop off percentage on and after above the fold?
[14.06.24, 18:13:53] ~ P: Yo guys - anyone using Chase payments here? Would love to ask couple questions.
[14.06.24, 18:43:25] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Hey guys, having some issues with our ads rejection rate (we all ready launch engagement ads to up the approval rate) 
Any recommendations as far as  other solutions/management regarding this? 
This is a beauty brand and we do focus on body parts especially close shots on faces.
@⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩
[14.06.24, 18:54:49] ~ Wouter Akika: Try launching conversion image ads to up your approval rate
[14.06.24, 18:55:01] ~ Wouter Akika: Then after that, do the same with conversion video ads
[14.06.24, 18:55:35] ~ Wouter Akika: Then use the ones that got approved to keep on duplicating inside your ad sets to keep increasing that approval rate using conversion video ads ‎<This message was edited>
[14.06.24, 18:56:02] ~ Wouter Akika: We found that nothing beats  conversion video ads to increase your ad account strength
[14.06.24, 18:56:45] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Okay that makes a lot of sense actually @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩
[14.06.24, 18:56:52] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Thanks for the head up 🫡
[14.06.24, 19:11:55] ~ Thomas Dolcini: So after doing this, for all ads  that got disapproved do you then just relaunch it and it goes through? Or do you pay an insider to get push it through? @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩
[14.06.24, 19:35:49] Matán Intsuper: We used to have all our video ads rejected for our beauty brand, we are launching lots of image ads as well and since then almost 0 rejections so maybe that would be the solution
[14.06.24, 19:36:30] Matán Intsuper: Try relaunching and if it doesn’t work pay an insider. We never paid an insider to approve ads
[14.06.24, 20:14:28] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Tranks @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩ yeah we do pay an Insider but ist Starting to be expensive. $50 every time and an and when duplicating with post ID stuff still gets disapproved.
[14.06.24, 20:20:21] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Also we are expecting very high CPM’s in the USA in the beauty vertical. Like $120 to $150 our AOV being $180. That seams very high wonder if that has to do with our rejection Rate being high.
[14.06.24, 20:21:14] ~ Wouter Akika: You can also click on the AI adcopy recommendations from meta when an ad gets rejected & publish after that, works 90% of the time for us
[14.06.24, 20:23:25] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Interesting @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩ will try that as well
[14.06.24, 20:27:32] ~ Santiago: Is anybody here going to AWC in Budapest?
[14.06.24, 20:29:56] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Yeah @⁨~Santiago⁩
[14.06.24, 20:30:19] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Going with @⁨~Eric R⁩
[14.06.24, 20:30:45] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I’m coming too!
[14.06.24, 21:01:03] Amit Wadhawan: Hi all! I'm trying to hire a video editor for VSLs. What is a good sample task to test the initial applicants that has worked well for you?
[14.06.24, 21:05:21] ~ David B: Are you using video ads at the moment?
[14.06.24, 21:05:59] Amit Wadhawan: Just launched my first video ad sets yesterday.
[14.06.24, 21:08:21] ~ David B: Congrats! You won't have any data yet so you have a couple of choices I like. 

You can choose your favorite or the one you would bet on to become the winner and have them try and improve in it and explain what they changed and why. 

Or you can send them an ad you like and have them make a version of it for your product.
[14.06.24, 21:09:08] ~ Mukhtar: Send the video editor a test to edit a 90-second video. Just provide them with 1 or 2 inspiration videos and very minimal details. 

This task will make it very clear how creative they are and how you would be dealing with them in the future.

Then pick the top ones, do interviews, and send out a second test. 

This time, pay them for the test and provide instructions to edit the full video.
[14.06.24, 21:10:21] ~ David B: I'd be looking for pace, smooth transitions, speed, communication, and creativity. 

Personally, I always pay people for test. Time isn't free but everyone operates in their own way. Hope that helps.
[14.06.24, 21:11:09] Amit Wadhawan: Awesome! Thank you @⁨~David B⁩ @⁨~Mukhtar⁩ 🙏🙏 That's really helpful. Will give these a go!

[14.06.24, 21:14:22] ~ Mukhtar: The fewer materials you give them, the more you see their skills and creativity.
[14.06.24, 22:54:37] ~ Ignasi: I will
[15.06.24, 10:32:18] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey Guys,

Hey guys I need your 🧠

We are struggling with a problem for a brand, we create tons of new ads, the metrics are good, but we have 1 big problem CPM increase a lot.
In April we was profitable at more 1M per month and now not profitable.


CPM went from 22 to 40 in the space of 2 month

Country CPM
🇺🇸: 22 > 43 (CPC 0.8 > 1.26)
🇬🇧 : 13 > 26
🇦🇺 14 > 27


We have tested new page 
New ad account
But nothing change

What is your advices?
[15.06.24, 10:33:30] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Potential issue Score page at 2 frozen, we have tested 3 differents agencies and no body can increase

Ultra competitor: each day we have tons of copycat
[15.06.24, 10:58:49] ~ Maxi: How many ad accounts did you test ?

I tested in the last 3-4 days about 6 new ad accounts and 2 out of 6 got around 40% lower CPMs and CPC

And each account from different source / agency  

We dropped from $125 to $42 CPM

and some dropped even to $15

*US
[15.06.24, 11:15:23] ~ Ignasi: Wow! What level of spend?
[15.06.24, 11:21:24] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: 4 new ad accounts
Different agency
[15.06.24, 11:21:56] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: You mean for the test of ad account?
[15.06.24, 11:32:17] ~ Ignasi: Sorry. I meant for @⁨~Maxi⁩ - I had no idea there could be such a difference in CPM based on ad account
[15.06.24, 11:56:08] ~ Maxi: I didn’t know either 😂
[15.06.24, 11:56:26] ~ Maxi: Each ad account has been tested with 2-3k spend per day to get some data
[15.06.24, 11:57:11] ~ Maxi: Top ads via CBO & A+ and some ABOs to check every possible combo on each account
[15.06.24, 12:32:01] ~ Ignasi: That’s amazing
[15.06.24, 12:44:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: And you just launch the exact same bunch of creatives on each ad account for best comparison? Interesting
[15.06.24, 12:56:42] ~ Maxi: Yes, ofc you might break even or loose some money that way on a few  accounts but once you identified which has lowest CPM you stop the others
[15.06.24, 13:04:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jep very nice
[15.06.24, 15:52:08] ‪+1 (336) 312‑4191‬: Hey, anyone know how I can get a banned personal FB account back? My account got permanently restricted a year ago for leaving the US. No policies broken.

Shopify plus
Charging for shipping on orders under 80
[16.06.24, 0:54:25] ~ Santi Roa: We do a lot of proper AB testing + surveys to customers 

Also building and behaving like a real brand helps.

[16.06.24, 11:29:31] ~ Luka: What type of questions do you find most valuable to ask in a survey?
[16.06.24, 11:31:28] ~ Luka: One thing we added in our checkout page (can also be done in the cart page too) is something like "Congratulations, you're one step away from {benefit}". You can test multiple word variations. We split-tested a while ago, and it was a winner
[16.06.24, 11:32:58] ~ Luka: Adding custom-made icons below the checkout button also helped us: money-back, free shipping, free returns (or you can use something related to customer support, warranty, etc depending on your offer)

[16.06.24, 15:44:51] ~ Anvar: Imo all my scripts and edits are rather soft — but bans are still brutal

[16.06.24, 16:04:52] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: Medellin was the best. I was there last Spring and have yet to see somewhere with the best co-working, food, and scenery. And everything is so reasonably priced. 100% recommend
[16.06.24, 16:19:19] Radek: can’t compare it to standard accounts but even with agency accounts, rejections are common.

We’re in health space and for us there are 2 factors causing bans…focus on body part and personal attributes policy.

One problem is in script writing and second in content sourcing. If you can identify the problem, it’s easy to resolve…works for us in 100% cases.

[17.06.24, 10:36:52] ~ Malik: Hi guys, quick question please : where do you get your video editors ? I'm tired of online PH because even if they can do some great work, they very bad at communicating with. They take hours or days to respond, always have the same excuses (they all the same grandma lol) I feel like I should hire people in eastern europe or anywhere els and pay more. I'd love to get your opinion on this thx
[17.06.24, 10:40:37] Topi: @⁨~Malik⁩ onlinejobs, upwork, facebook communities
[17.06.24, 10:41:16] Topi: you have to create funnel that filters them with as little effort as possible so you only end up talking with the G’s
[17.06.24, 10:41:58] ~ Maxi: I aggree with Topi.

One of our best editors is from onlinejobs
[17.06.24, 10:42:06] Topi: I have now covered this last 2x VSL calls, since everyone has this same question maybe I can do short training about this and add it to skool
[17.06.24, 10:48:08] ~ Malik: I see, thank you Topi I'll check the recordings
[17.06.24, 13:21:01] ~ Santi Roa: I hire on linkedin. The problem with these websites (Onlineph) is that people there are mentally framed to be freelancers, not fulltime workers. Although you might find some that have good potential and end up being fulltime workers, many of them are jumping from job to job kind of freelancing for periods of time.

One way to solve this is just hiring people full-time and treat them like real employees. And do what big companies do to retain, train and motivate talent. The problem is: then you need weekly meetings, management systems, and a lot of bs ‎<This message was edited>
[17.06.24, 13:23:04] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: What type of monthly salaries you pay for people hired via linkedin?

[17.06.24, 13:31:25] ~ Santi Roa: Again, there are millions of factors. A solid editor in Colombia might be between 700 and 1300usd
[17.06.24, 13:32:46] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: Got it, when hiring how do you make sure that you hold the video-editor accountable, because as you said a lot of people are in this freelancing mindset
[17.06.24, 14:06:42] ~ Erik Pecovnik: how do you pay them to get expenses?
[17.06.24, 14:09:43] ~ Santi Roa: It's just a different kind of play.
I model what bigger companies do. They hire using a method like Topgrading (check the book), they build a culture, they offer them benefits. At the end is all about making them feel they are truly part of something
[17.06.24, 14:10:35] ~ Santi Roa: It's the same as building a brand. It's all about the perception and there is no magic trick or one thing to do to get there.
Is just being consistent with a big set of things, and improve it along the way
[17.06.24, 14:10:36] ~ Erik Pecovnik: also its nothing better than having a team that works in harmony
[17.06.24, 14:10:56] ~ Santi Roa: To get expenses? I didn't understood the question
[17.06.24, 14:11:15] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Do they give you an invoice?
[17.06.24, 14:11:45] ~ Santi Roa: In my case I hire fulltime, I pay them a monthly salary.
[17.06.24, 14:12:07] ~ Erik Pecovnik: oh okay
[17.06.24, 14:12:19] ~ Santi Roa: Then the legal stuff idk is handled by my team but yeah they make an invoice or something and we pay that plus healthcare plus some stuff

I currently live in Canada but am considering moving permanently to either Dubai or Spain with my family.

I've heard that there is no income tax in Dubai. Is it true that I can transfer my money from my US-based LLC to Dubai without having to pay any taxes?

The second option I'm looking into is Spain. Are there effective tax rates for overseas income in Spain?

Thanks for your insights!

https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83714028249
[18.06.24, 19:57:10] ~ Yusuf: from what i know yes you dont pay income tax in uae but imo they can introduce income tax in near future

i was considering spain too, couldn't find 100% legal way to avoid taxes or paying low when you live there 180 days + in calendar year

if you find a way, let me know
[18.06.24, 20:02:37] ~ Kim Romanov: I’m not looking for a way to avoid taxes. I hope to pay around 20% to get my money and live in a nice place. There was so-called Beckham Tax Law in Spain, that fixes 24% personal income tax for overseas incomes but in this case I think I’ll also pay a corporative tax in the US. 
I’m looking for someone who lives in Spain or Dubai now and knows for sure
[18.06.24, 20:15:55] ~ Yusuf: Again, just will share my idea, someone from spain can answer better, hope this helps

Beckham law has criterias, one of them is not owning more than 25% of a company that you're getting payments from (if you give ownership to someone else, this could work)

but doing beckham law with single member US LLC is tricky because US LLC is disregarded entity by default (you can setup tax structure as c corp and pay corporate taxes to US)

For disregarded entity, whatever it makes, it goes directly to owner and owner is responsible for paying income taxes wherever they are registered, so technically you will not only responsible for the money you bring to spain but will be responsible for total profit you make from your company

if it's not single member llc, then it automatically needs to pay corporate taxes in the US
[18.06.24, 20:35:25] ~ Ignasi: They’re working on an Mbappé law in the community of Madrid but I believe it hasn’t passed yet. It will almost certainly pass if it hasn’t already. It’s similar to Beckham’s but applies to residents of Madrid. You can fix your legal address there and live elsewhere in Spain
[18.06.24, 20:57:36] ~ Bilel: Guys anyone knows if a single member LLC can get permanent establishment in other countries given that it’s not a corporation and is a passthrough entity? If we take the example of being resident in Dubai, would you pay 0% on your single member LLC or 9%?
[18.06.24, 20:58:31] ~ Bilel: Unlikely that they will introduce personal income tax anytime soon. They were clear it’s a policy they are very strong on.
[18.06.24, 21:29:52] ~ Davi: hi everyone, has it ever happened to you that when the ad budget increases, sales collapse completely? Despite the fact that we are using advertorials? Does anyone know how to fix this?
[18.06.24, 22:24:53] ~ Thomas Dolcini: I would try to grow the spend horizontally across more adset/campaign even as accounts, maybe you have a sweet spot in you ad account
[18.06.24, 22:26:02] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Question for all you guys what’s your internal system for customised comments on your winning post ID’s. How often do you post?
[18.06.24, 22:32:00] ~ Davi: It happens precisely in that case, when I add adsets or campaigns for further tests
[19.06.24, 6:38:07] ~ Kim Romanov: Very interested in this question too
[19.06.24, 10:49:25] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Did anyone test “Learn more” vs “Shop now” button on fb ads

[19.06.24, 12:53:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Trying to get a dutch business phone number on a LLC. most services require a business in the netherlands to sign up though.

[22.06.24, 17:51:22] ~ Sonu Duhra: If you can increase reached checkout  you increase CVR. We had reviews and a FAQ on our cart page, we had a drop off like you have, we removed everything and now see an increase in reached checkout of 20%
[22.06.24, 17:52:26] ~ Sonu Duhra: CVR was 2,60% now 3,25%
[22.06.24, 17:53:24] ~ Joshua: On Funnelish?
[22.06.24, 17:53:43] ~ Sonu Duhra: Shopify
[22.06.24, 17:54:06] ~ Joshua: Interesting
[22.06.24, 17:55:24] ~ Sonu Duhra: I want to try next cart drawer or sending customers direct to checkout. If anyone has tried let me know, curious…
[22.06.24, 17:58:39] ~ Joshua: slide cart works great for me… I don't have the exact data of when I switched but it gave me a positive pump in CRV. I like the way it presents upsells
[22.06.24, 18:20:58] ~ Nils: Hey @⁨~Lachy Waldon⁩ what actions did you take to get these results?
[22.06.24, 18:54:47] ~ Erik Pecovnik: low ticket, 40€ AOV
[23.06.24, 15:12:11] ~ Lachy Waldon: $180
[23.06.24, 15:13:04] ~ Lachy Waldon: it is a new brand but nevertheless it’s a brand. You’ve got to treat it like that and as if you’ve got a storefront with your face on it! Treat it properly and customers respect it!
[23.06.24, 17:02:43] ~ RS: How do you usually transfer adspend from one ad account to another New ad acc? You just make New similar campaigns to your best performing campaigns that were in your previous ad acc? And you start with high budgets from the start?
[23.06.24, 17:09:11] Topi: Yes
[23.06.24, 17:09:12] Topi: exactly
[23.06.24, 17:09:17] Topi: but not high budgets
[23.06.24, 17:09:51] Topi: Just gradually upgrade but if something is working very well on account 1 you can increase pretty aggressive usually
[23.06.24, 17:10:11] ~ RS: Thanks for the tips bro 💪🏻
[23.06.24, 17:24:11] ~ Nils: Nice @⁨~Lachy Waldon⁩ , would you be able to define what you mean by brand, and what impact do you believe that had on the results of your advertising?

Because just thinking logically I have a hard time believing that just having a brand would be the determining factor. There are lots of people who have beautifully branded websites with fast shipping who dont get nearly as good results.

I imagine your great results might come from the fact that you know your customers better than any of your competitors perhaps, and then your branding, fast shipping etc might be a +.

Let me know if you disagree :)
[23.06.24, 17:34:23] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Guys I replicated my landing on Funnelish for my beauty brand and the conversion rate was awful compared to Shopify. I've seen other people here complaining about the same issue. Has anyone actually had a better CR on Funnelish over Shopify? Could it be something related to the product itself, or perhaps Funnelish works better for older audiences?
[23.06.24, 17:34:57] Topi: Is your offer in the checkout?
[23.06.24, 17:35:13] ~ Alessandro Sassi: yes
[23.06.24, 17:35:14] ~ Maxi: Are you profitable or are you purely comparing CR percentage ?
[23.06.24, 17:35:43] Topi: We see every time we do this the conversion rate dies
[23.06.24, 17:35:49] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I didnt get a conversion with hundreds of dollars spent honeslty, only optins. Placed test orders and checkout works fine
[23.06.24, 17:36:50] ~ Alessandro Sassi: oh this is interesting. How is your checkout page on funnelish? Did you try to make it look the same as Shopify?
[23.06.24, 17:44:50] ~ Maxi: The best thing for funnelish new brands:

Try your funnel 1:1 as it’s in Shopify (which you probably did )


Try 1-3 top converting funnel templates and add your copy and images ‎<This message was edited>
[23.06.24, 17:45:28] Topi: Yes if you dont have variants and youre able to do it like in shopify its the same usually than with shopify
[23.06.24, 17:58:04] ~ L: Do you have any template to share/recommend ?
[23.06.24, 18:09:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: You show offer + price on salespage always?
[23.06.24, 18:11:59] ~ Alessandro Sassi: thanks bro. No variants only bundles. I guess showing the price at checkout works best for lower priced products. I have high aov, 180$+
[23.06.24, 18:59:44] ~ Joshua: Has anyone been able to figure out how to use funnelish when you have a bunch of variants?
[23.06.24, 19:00:45] ~ Richie: Make specific 1 product skus to connect for automations and hide them on shopify store.

[24.06.24, 7:06:16] ~ Sonu Duhra: We have Gempagea, it’s nice but has its limitations. The developers we worked with most of them recommend pagefly
[24.06.24, 7:16:59] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Awesome to know, thanks. Have been diving into PageFly today and am seeing some great result. Happy with it so far

[25.06.24, 14:18:44] ~ Joshua: The best way I have found is when you're making your ad, you just have to pay attention to the dates your DCT was created.

so if you launched your DCT June 1st, when you create the new ad and select the post ID just scroll to June 1st and find the ad with the most engagement and whatever thumbnail.. really the only way I've found to do it

I have an advertorial (listicle) performing well - i want to make some variations to it to see if i can improve performance.

Would you run it as a split test on funnelish side or launch them as new ads on facebook?
[26.06.24, 9:21:34] ~ Mukhtar: Split test on Funnelish or some other split testing softwares
[26.06.24, 10:30:16] ~ Filip: i am recommending VWO, if you have advertorial and checkout on same domain it’s free
[26.06.24, 10:30:32] ~ Filip: and you can do split test url or even split test of elements using vwo editor

[26.06.24, 20:11:10] ~ Alexander Sundström: I have a question regarding funnelish and Shopify. My domain provider is simply.com and I only have dns service from them. So if I try and add a subdomain it gets messed up. I am thinking about getting another domain similar to the one I am using and use that for funnelish, would that work or just use the original funnelish domain? Thanks guys
[26.06.24, 20:23:51] ~ Allan L: Anyone experienced that their Mercury account was just gone from one day to another?
When I log in it just says "Looks like you don't currently have access to any mercury accounts."
[26.06.24, 20:26:45] Matán Intsuper: Whatttt
[26.06.24, 20:26:52] Matán Intsuper: Did you have money there
[26.06.24, 20:28:01] ~ Santiago: Yep maybe you didn’t submitted documents from past revisions
[26.06.24, 20:28:05] ~ Santiago: Just email them
[26.06.24, 20:28:34] ~ Allan L: yup.. nothing much, like 8k or something
[26.06.24, 20:28:50] Matán Intsuper: Sounds extreme
[26.06.24, 20:28:53] China Bigboss: im using the account daily i didn't notice nothing tbh
[26.06.24, 20:28:58] ~ Allan L: I did email them, just wanted to hear here first if anyone had experience with it before enganging in the support case.
[26.06.24, 20:30:08] ~ Allan L: No requests, not even a email about the account being closed
[26.06.24, 20:30:16] ~ Allan L: Hoping its just a bug.
[26.06.24, 20:31:30] Matán Intsuper: Doesn’t sound like a bug
[26.06.24, 20:31:33] Matán Intsuper: It’s your bank account
[26.06.24, 20:32:02] ~ Santiago: 2 months ago it happened the same to me, i was going to pay a big shopping spree and the card kept getting declined lol i checked mercury and I didnt have access ‎<This message was edited>
[26.06.24, 20:33:13] ~ Allan L: yea we just did a transaction today for the fb agency accounts we be using, that got declined. 
But not the biggest transaction done on the account tho. (Its a new account)

What did you do to solve that? Just wierd they dont send any email saying that your account is closed or anything ‎<This message was edited>
[26.06.24, 20:33:58] ~ Santiago: Weird cause almost immediately they sent an email advising on what was going on
[26.06.24, 20:34:20] ~ Santiago: I had to provide proof of address and operations in the us
[26.06.24, 20:34:57] ~ Santiago: I sent them an email asking for access and got access again immediately ‎<This message was edited>
[26.06.24, 20:35:45] ~ Allan L: Okay, I hope thats the case here as well. Really appreciate the information man!
[27.06.24, 0:23:37] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey, guys.

Need some advice. After June 15, right after Father's Day, the price per purchase in meta ads rose sharply by $25 from $35 to $55-60 and is still growing (AOV $85), although before that everything worked well for 5 months and there was a constant growth. 

The end of February and March were similarly stormy. 


We haven't managed to stabilize the results yet.  Reducing the budget doesn't help. We restarted all the campaigns from 0 - it didn't help. 
Today, we turned off advertising altogether because the CPM increased by $13 (from $20 to $32-33), the cost per click increased by 3 times. 


Is it a slow season and we need to wait it out after the holidays or is the problem so severe in creative?
[27.06.24, 1:58:27] ~ Jacobo Uribe: How many creatives have you tested in that time frame? Have you found other winners? 

Are you split testing offers/landing pages?
[27.06.24, 2:19:56] ~ Kim Romanov: For the last 2 weeks we’ve tested around 6 new creatives, for the previous period I need to count
[27.06.24, 2:21:36] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Test more then, brother. Especially if your hit rate is not very high and your CPA is rising
[27.06.24, 2:21:58] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Testing should be at least 10% of your budget, you can go higher during periods where performance is dropping
‎[27.06.24, 3:44:17] ~ Santi Roa: ‎image omitted
[27.06.24, 3:44:36] ~ Santi Roa: Anyone is aware of anything related to this? ‎<This message was edited>
[27.06.24, 3:45:22] Matán Intsuper: i use mercury and did not receive such mail
[27.06.24, 3:46:16] ~ Santi Roa: It might be based on the deposits amount
[27.06.24, 3:46:32] ~ Santi Roa: Maybe it only affected some clients
[27.06.24, 3:46:37] Matán Intsuper: probably
[27.06.24, 3:46:41] Matán Intsuper: but doesnt sound serious
[27.06.24, 3:47:20] ~ Santi Roa: But the FDIC sent a few letters to Evolve
[27.06.24, 3:47:30] Matán Intsuper: In a post on social media platform X, Mercury said Evolve's security breach included some account numbers and deposit balances associated with the fintech company and that affected customers have been notified of preventative steps.
[27.06.24, 3:47:55] Matán Intsuper: this is interesting: according to a Bloomberg News report, which also said the hackers had given the Fed until Tuesday afternoon to meet its ransom demands in exchange for not posting sensitive data from an alleged hack of the central bank.
[27.06.24, 3:48:03] ~ Santi Roa: I mean the data breach is a problem, but I'm scared of a bank run towards Evolve, leaving Mercury funds empty
[27.06.24, 3:48:25] Matán Intsuper: you are insured by the FDIC. I used SVB bank and I got all my money back
[27.06.24, 3:49:08] ~ Santi Roa: Was it over 1m?
[27.06.24, 3:49:38] ~ Santi Roa: FDIC have been sending letters to other fintecs about their use of "expanded FDIC insurance"
[27.06.24, 3:50:41] ~ Santi Roa: Hopefully nothing happens. This gives me hope. Still doubting if the FDIC will really cover the total sum if things go south...
[27.06.24, 3:50:44] ~ Mike Ramsey: They’ll get gobbled up by big bank or feds will bail them out (again)
[27.06.24, 3:51:03] Matán Intsuper: So split your deposit in different banks
[27.06.24, 3:51:07] Matán Intsuper: If you’re worried
[27.06.24, 3:51:44] Matán Intsuper: In my case no but even deposits above $1m got refunded in the svb case
[27.06.24, 3:52:25] ~ Mike Ramsey: Always keep good deposit balance in big bank - you should never have big balances in neobanks.  Diversify balances
[27.06.24, 9:50:53] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Hey guys, any recommendations on reviews app? I noticed only loox is getting us submited reviews when we send out request others are not so good. But loox can be expensive
[27.06.24, 10:01:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: That might be the reason i got bumped from my Mercury account then lol
[27.06.24, 11:20:50] ~ Alexander Sundström: Is it possible to duplicate a meta pixel?
[27.06.24, 16:28:20] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: Does anyone have a suggesting for a good US accountant for ecom stores? We’re not super impressed with ours
[27.06.24, 16:29:26] ‪+1 (336) 339‑7107‬: So I switched to Judge.me and I’ve been happy. At first I thought it slowed my loading speed down but it turned out to be something else. I would just make sure you split test it for a week or two but they’ve been good for me
[27.06.24, 16:47:21] Yaniv: Expensive? If you think this expensive then look into okendo or yotpo
[27.06.24, 17:04:56] ‪+1 (306) 262‑1967‬: Or trust pilot
[28.06.24, 8:05:31] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey boys,

[28.06.24, 18:25:16] René Crooijmans: Someone I know just got banned from Stripe for using that 2/3 days ago
[28.06.24, 18:25:59] René Crooijmans: Checkify didn’t sync about 2% of orders to Shopify so orders weren’t getting fulfilled, the guy didn’t notice and it triggered a Stripe ban
[28.06.24, 18:49:14] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Oh damn I didn't even take this in account.
I was mainly worried because I noticed a drop in conversions since using checkify compared to the standard Shopify checkout, and I am not the only one. Did this person you know had his problem as well?
[28.06.24, 19:03:22] ~ Matt: ‎‪+34 622 73 20 52‬ removed ~ Matt

[29.06.24, 18:46:26] ~ Sonu Duhra: they sound pretty confident about this, maybe worth the try
[29.06.24, 18:47:21] ~ Richie: I’ve tried it, worth the 2k credit but not much more
[29.06.24, 18:52:40] ~ Jacobo Uribe: A large majority of the traffic goes to your website so it ends up being like $1k-$1.5k in ad spend for free
[29.06.24, 18:57:01] ~ Richie: Usually a much higher cpc as well , I always see around a 20-40% lower roas with those campaigns
[29.06.24, 18:59:20] ~ Jacobo Uribe: True, the CPMs are higher. I think they put you in a different tier with these campaigns due to it being a free credit
[29.06.24, 19:38:59] ~ Sam O: Just like YT, now FB want some of that TTshop style money
[29.06.24, 19:39:19] ~ Sam O: A day late and a dollar short 😂
[29.06.24, 19:40:30] ~ Sam O: FB could have smashed it with FB Shop when they launched it like 5-6 years ago.... But they did nothing with it 

So now they are trying again it seems based on what I suspect was TTshop doing well
[29.06.24, 19:43:05] ~ Adonis A: That’s facts! FB shops & marketplace w the shipping option for US based merchants had so much potential but they couldn’t sustain it. We were doing decent organic numbers there but nothing compared to what TT shop is doing
[29.06.24, 20:44:39] Matán Intsuper: They basically give you $2k to test for free, what is there to think about?
[29.06.24, 21:07:29] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Tell me about it bro… that’s how I got my start in Ecom. Made good money with personal Marketplace and was stoked when they announced Shops. 

After the first honeymoon months it flopped so hard. No idea why Meta didn’t go all in on it, they could be at the scale Tik Tok Shop is on now.
[29.06.24, 21:08:48] ~ Sam O: If FB did it proper like 5-6 years ago .... They would be 100x the size of TTS now
[29.06.24, 21:09:14] ~ Sam O: FB could have been the second biggest ecom platform to Amazon .... zuchs missed that trick ‎<This message was edited>
[29.06.24, 21:12:45] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Yep. Would’ve opened a massive revenue stream for them, too. No more just relying on ad spend.

[30.06.24, 4:29:11] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Is there any way to remove a Facebook post, inside a facebook group made for sharing experiences with buying products online? 

Someone made a thread that then proceeded to get 100+ comments, they basically dig as much on my business as possible and post tons of info like my address, pictures of my home etc.

Anyone ever dealt with this? Not really sure how to proceed, never had it happen before:/

[30.06.24, 5:56:49] René Crooijmans: Outbound CPC is cost per link click
[30.06.24, 5:59:26] ~ Adonis A: Ah ok thanks. So rn I cut 1/3 because cpc was very high

[30.06.24, 19:13:10] ~ Mukhtar: Hey, 
Wonder how do you guys deal with copywriters for landing pages. 

Should they beat the control or they will just write a copy that's it
[30.06.24, 19:57:19] ~ David B: The ultimate goal is always to beat the control but that doesn't always mean rewriting the same page. 

Look through your customer insights, post purchase surveys, and heat maps.

Sometimes you need a complete rewrite and tp test an entirely new angle of the copy is underperforming.  

If the copy is strong, it might be more of a conversion copywrting job where certain sections need to be improved an optimised.
[30.06.24, 19:57:52] ~ David B: FYI, I can't text for shit. sorry for the typo. 😂

[1.07.24, 0:45:25] Amit Wadhawan: Not sure. Will check the logs once I get to a computer. But it’s strange. Had 4.5 ROAS yesterday. 0 sales today so far.
[1.07.24, 6:24:32] Amit Wadhawan: So it's interesting. I checked the logs and there's nothing for today in there. Not the creation of a customer, payment intent or anything. The customer called back again saying that they had tried several times to pay but keep getting an error. Definitely seems like a issue with Funnelish.
[1.07.24, 7:08:39] ~ Y: Can you pm me their email and checkout page url! And do you have any idea what error they were seeing?

[2.07.24, 1:09:22] ~ RS: Do FB bots also crawl next pages after the lander, or it just crawls the first page in funnelish? I tested different type of advertorial (with less aggressive copywriting and without before after pictures) and for this adv CPM to US is 230$ 😀 with previous adv it was still high - 120-160$ to us. Maybe fb also crawls the next page and checkout page in Funnelish so they see some before after pics etc?
[2.07.24, 1:10:08] ~ RS: Btw profitable even with so high cpms but I want to lower them. Picture ads
[2.07.24, 3:16:09] ~ Patrycja: Hi everyone! Does anyone have a recommendation for a good graphic designer for static images?
[2.07.24, 3:59:43] ~ Jeb: @⁨~RS⁩ in my experience fb only crawls one URL deep
[2.07.24, 4:29:53] ‪+7 985 367‑53‑18‬: Yes, it does. Do a test: add a cloaker to the pages that are in the subsequent stages of the funnel. When launching a campaign, even before the ad is approved, you will already be able to see many Facebook user agents on the pages that are ahead
[2.07.24, 4:35:58] ‪+7 985 367‑53‑18‬: But I think using a less agressive lander can indeed offer some advantages. It’s not just that Facebook might have difficulty crawling the subsequent page, but it also strategically manages the flow of user interaction. A lander can soften the initial impact of aggressive copywriting. If an aggressive copy were placed directly on the next page, it could immediately raise flags within Facebook's review system, as their crawlers and algorithms are designed to detect and flag such content early on. However, by placing a more neutral or compliant copy on the lander, you reduce the likelihood of triggering Facebook's scrutiny at the first touchpoint. Furthermore, from a psychological perspective, users who encounter aggressive marketing messages on the second page are more likely to perceive it as part of your website rather than associating it directly with Facebook ‎<This message was edited>

I didn't increase the segmentation. 
And I didn't do anything to the list...

How many offers do you test per week?
How do you make a product last 1M+ per month with Facebook ads only?
[2.07.24, 18:46:35] Carlos Leeseman: Are you using advertorials? And is it the offer that expires or your creatives? By myself continuously thought that my offer was not strong enough, but after a master VSL I found out that my offer was good enough but it was my creatives that continuously bled to death after a few weeks.

[5.07.24, 22:53:30] ~ Harvey: Pain in the ass to set up and you defo need a good dev on your team but it’s miles ahead of Shopify IMO

[8.07.24, 10:55:50] ~ Malik: Hey guys, what are the good stats that an anbandonned checkout flow must have in terms of open rate, click rate and placed order please ? Like the industry average "good" stats. And how many emails in that flow you guys have ?
[8.07.24, 10:59:42] ~ David B: Between 30-40% open rate. And a 20% CTR. 

Most brands use a 3 email sequence. 

1. Did you forget something? 
2. Reminder/ stock is limited/ social proof
3.  Final reminder. Some people add an additional discount to the final reminder if they buy right now but this depends on your margins.

[10.07.24, 18:12:01] ~ RS: Hey, do you know is it bad if I have 2 seperate stripe accounts (under the same email and company) for one website? I have one stripe acc for my main store but I also want to remake my other stripe account and put the same website for the other stirpe. So I will have 2 stripe accounts for one website - one acc for US/CA funnels in funnelish, and another acc for other geo funnels. I just dont want to keep all eggs in one bag, because if there are some problems with one acc, then all my 7 day revenue is on hold
[10.07.24, 18:22:05] ~ Y: it’s fine to have multiple Stripe accounts under the same entity/details (actually trying to change the same entity details would cause problems), having multiple Stripes under the same entity does not lower your risk by much at all, if one is banned the other one gets flagged too.
[10.07.24, 18:27:19] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): This is true. If you’re doing meaningful volume, I can connect you to an AE at Stripe so your accounts are overseen by a human and won’t get auto shut down
[10.07.24, 18:28:53] Matán Intsuper: Not necessarily true. I have 5 stripe accounts under the same entity, one is banned and it did not affect the others. Only if they flag the whole business
[10.07.24, 18:29:56] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey Guys, who do great results with tik tok shop?

We need mandatory stock in us?
[10.07.24, 19:05:03] ~ Y: I think it depends on the cause of ban! though certainly other accounts get flagged regardless as higher risk, even if they do not get banned yet.
[10.07.24, 19:13:21] ~ RS: Yeah I had many stripe accounts under the same entity and email for 4 years already. Some have been banned years ago but the others are still ok. I was just wondering if there is nothing wrong if I remake one of my older accounts with the same website as my current main stripe acc

Does anyone have experience switching Shopify Payments from Canada (or another country) to the US?

I'm currently waiting for the EIN for my new US-based LLC and have requested to switch from Canadian Shopify Payments to US through support. They have asked me to provide proof of operational presence in the US.

Here's the email I received from Shopify:

---

Hi there,

Kait here from the Merchant Verification team at Shopify. We understand that you are looking to use Shopify Payments United States. In order to make this change successfully, we require some information. Can you please describe what kind of business operations you currently have in the United States?

Shopify has to follow regulatory and contractual obligations which require that we only provide financial services to merchants who are physically located in a supported region. Shopify’s standards for this requirement mean that registering your business in the region and obtaining a bank account is not enough.

To be eligible for Shopify Payments, you must meet one of the following criteria:

- If you are a Sole Proprietor, the business owner must personally live in the country.
- If you are a Company, LLC, or similar business type, you must be registered with the government of that country and also be able to provide evidence of substantial operations physically happening there.

If you believe your business meets these requirements, please reply here with a detailed description of your operations in the United States.

Some examples of operational presence could include (but are not limited to): You rent or own warehouse space and ship your orders from there, you have an office there with employees consistently occupying the space, or you have retail location(s) there. You may have other examples of operations you have in the country which you’d like to provide: If you can respond with as much detail as possible, that is helpful for our review.

If you operate the business entirely from outside of the United States, you can confirm this also.

Please only provide written details and do not send documents over email - if we require documents to confirm these details, we will provide you with a secure portal to upload them.

Your payouts will be paused until this review is completed.

---

Has anyone gone through this process or have advice on how to provide the required information?

Thanks!
[13.07.24, 0:08:35] ~ Jeb: Hi, does anyone know how to counter bad press/ comments in Reddit?
[13.07.24, 0:27:23] ~ Jacobo Uribe: There's a method called Astroturfing which is pretty grey hat. Basically it creates threads about your brand or product and then puts your brand in a very positive light. That may overshadow the bad press and could rank higher in the search. 

You can also hire some shills to respond to comments/post or address them yourself as a brand. If you're going to address them yourself be very careful of what you say lol. Although if you do it right it may have a larger impact.

[13.07.24, 4:50:32] ~ Jeb: Thank you
[13.07.24, 18:12:23] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys,

My store was averaging a 25-30% profit until last week. I even launched a new advertorial that boosted our ROAS to 3 throughout the weekend.

However, since Monday, everything’s dead. Profit has dropped to -15%, so I am losing money.. only one profitable day. The ATC rate has dropped, and the very few people who add to cart are not proceeding to checkout. I’ve checked users recordings and looked for technical issues but can’t pinpoint the cause.

CVR went from 1.4% to 0.7%.

We’ve also increased creative testing recently, but all the creatives are performing poorly.

I know in summer sales drops for my product despite not being seasonal, but I doubt this is the only reason.

What do you usually do in these cases?
[13.07.24, 20:03:08] Yaniv: Try reduce budgets by 20-30% daily until your performance gets better.. keep doing it day after day until your results are getting better. Good luck
[13.07.24, 20:31:09] Matán Intsuper: Run more products
[13.07.24, 20:34:34] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I am scaling down already
[13.07.24, 20:34:39] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Will launch a new offer soon
[13.07.24, 21:01:27] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We got the same issue 900k with 1 offer in one month and not profitable next month 

How is your score page ?
Did you have tested news angle and news concept?
[13.07.24, 21:03:40] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Did you solve it?

I have tested a few different concepts, but around the same angle.

I should try some new ones but I should edit the offer page as it is specific
[13.07.24, 21:04:14] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Score page is 3.3
[13.07.24, 21:04:40] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Also this ad account is pretty new, like 3 weeks old
[13.07.24, 21:07:39] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Only by launching new market
And for my winning market that was USA only new offer but results was not the same
Still trying to solve

[13.07.24, 23:33:31] ~ Jeb: Hi everyone, I’m new and trying to figure out how I can add value to the group. Recently we made a switch from using 3PL’s and 3rd party manufacturing to doing it all ourselves under one roof. I was originally terrified by the idea and thought it would take my focus off marketing etc. But if anyone has any questions or is thinking about making and fulfilling their own products hit me up
[14.07.24, 3:34:58] ~ Jeb: I’m realising I didnt give the benefits, overall I was very anxious about the costs of leasing a warehouse in Los Angeles and hiring labor to manufacture and fulfill orders but once I got into it I wish I made the jump much sooner, overall I’m saving about 40% on my 3PL bill by fulfilling orders in house, we cut out fed ex 2 day pak rates from $13 down to $9.86 which is most of our orders and even beat our 3PL’s rate of $10.75. And overall cut shipping supply cost by 60% I was shocked at how much 3PL’s nickel and dime you for everything. 

In terms of managing inventory I never worry if we’re going to run out anymore because I have everything stored there and we can make product very quickly and we don’t have to wait and we overall have a lot more control over quality all around. Overall I’d encourage other people to do it if it makes sense, it was a scary but very fulfilling jump to take, one I never saw myself doing in the beginning
[14.07.24, 3:37:26] ~ Jeb: Also cut product manufacturering cost about 35%
[14.07.24, 9:02:06] ~ Sam O: The USA is fucked

[15.07.24, 14:18:10] ~ RS: Is it possible to add PayPal Express checkout in funnelish? With regular PayPal payment option customer still need to enter their email and other details in the checkout form. And many customers leave checkout because they are used to PayPal Express checkout when they dont need to enter any other info on the website. Many customers have contacted my live chat and told about it
[15.07.24, 15:48:51] ~ Erik Pecovnik: custom code
[15.07.24, 15:49:24] ~ Erik Pecovnik: app called “section store” has very good video section avaliable

Courious how people max out their days.

You might want to look into *time boxing* to avoid Parkinson's Law...

Parkinson's Law is the idea that work expands to fill whatever time you give it. 

Without a time limit, it will just keep going. 
 
Instead of: todo - write a Full VSL...  

Try: write a full VSL - 2 hours - 9am-11am.

This is insanely effective. 

Hope that helps. 

@⁨China Bigboss⁩ makes a great suggestion too. Covey Matrix helps you realise how much sh*t you are doing that should be completely removed or delegated.
[15.07.24, 19:12:08] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: @⁨~David B⁩ @⁨China Bigboss⁩ Thanks for the tips, will definitely be trying this!
[15.07.24, 19:13:51] ~ David B: I write over 210 emails per month across 8 different ecom brands. It would be impossible without deep work and time boxing.
[15.07.24, 19:14:40] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Wow good job!
[15.07.24, 19:16:16] ~ David B: Everyone here is a machine because we don't accept mediocrity. 

That's for regular folk... 

And poor people... 😂
[15.07.24, 20:24:38] ~ Sonu Duhra: Do you guys separate your ad sets by angles or do you put all angles in one ad set?
[15.07.24, 20:24:58] Carlos Leeseman: Separate 100%
[15.07.24, 20:28:06] Victor: https://refer.virtualpostmail.com/l/1M8SE28CC/
[15.07.24, 20:32:16] ~ Sonu Duhra: What about new winning creatives, you add them to the existing scaling ad set or create new one?
[15.07.24, 20:34:00] ~ Ignasi: What level of spend?
[15.07.24, 20:36:38] Carlos Leeseman: Depends on your strategy. We create new adset for each new variation.
[15.07.24, 20:37:09] Carlos Leeseman: From the beginning. If you test 1 concept with 5 leads (each different angle), you create 5 different adsets
[15.07.24, 20:38:18] ~ Ignasi: Got it
[15.07.24, 20:40:14] ~ Sonu Duhra: I meant when scaling not when testing
[15.07.24, 20:41:38] Carlos Leeseman: If you use CBO or ASC+ you can put them in 1 campaign. But with abo’s I would do it separately and scale each ABO separately based on performance
[15.07.24, 20:43:01] ~ Kim Romanov: Thanks but are there any other options that doesn’t cost $3600 per year to get approved once on the Shopify Payments?
[15.07.24, 20:43:24] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes we use CBO with 5 ad sets all same creatives. Means all the angles in same ad set
[15.07.24, 20:46:32] Carlos Leeseman: Yeah the I would do all angles in same adsets
[15.07.24, 20:46:47] Carlos Leeseman: But you could also do seperate CBO per angle. Just test it
[15.07.24, 20:47:05] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes that’s what I was thinking of
[15.07.24, 20:48:43] ~ Sonu Duhra: I was thinking of one CBO with ad sets per angle. Like if 5 angles then 5 ad sets
[15.07.24, 20:49:13] ~ Sonu Duhra: But within the same CBO
[15.07.24, 20:50:17] Carlos Leeseman: Hmm then your CBO will probably spend to only 1 adset and then you don't give your other angles a chance when they might have scale potential.
[15.07.24, 20:53:13] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yes that maybe could happen, but even now when I have them all in same ad set only 2-3 getting most spend, and sometime there are just to much creatives in there
[15.07.24, 20:53:40] ~ Sonu Duhra: But I would definitely try CBO per angle as well 👍
[15.07.24, 21:40:37] ~ Santi Roa: Hey Jonathan! I used to assign myself the same amount of tasks, but now I reduced it to max 3. Trying to leverage big big needle movers.
I separate my weeks time into blocks, and then organize my weekly tasks every friday and review it every sunday. I assign tasks per day on Clickup based on the type of task and time I have each day.

I try to experiment with my blocks to make the most out of them

[15.07.24, 21:44:21] ~ Wouter Akika: ;)
[15.07.24, 21:46:33] ~ Ignasi: I do something similar but compressed 

I analyze the previous week on Mondays and make the week’s plan 

I do deep work every day from 8-12. 3 big needle moving tasks 

Immediate team meeting time reserved from 12 to 1

External meetings 1 to 2

Then I’m done. 

For deep work I use pomodoro technique. In my case 40 minutes deep work, 20 minute break
[15.07.24, 21:46:57] ~ Ignasi: If no meetings then I’m done earlier
‎[15.07.24, 21:47:03] ~ Ignasi: ‎image omitted
[15.07.24, 21:47:29] ~ Ignasi: My calendar only shows up free from 12 to 2
[15.07.24, 21:47:38] Matán Intsuper: First of all, biggest effect for me was to cut by 90% all distractions possible (social life, scrolling fb/ig, girls). Recently I'm back watching the ESS videos (Alex, Serhii, Topi) which are very valuable, give ideas and motivation. Also, I'm reading self-development and business books again (also Alex is recommending them recently on his video calls) to get more ideas for the business and in life in general. Also have started meditating daily at least 10 minutes (gives me me focus and understanding of what I need to do, ideas for the business).

Regarding technical stuff and tasks: I used to have 3 top tasks to do daily but I stopped doing that. Now I have days that I am very productive and doing bunch of stuff. If I don't know what to do, I take a break reading/studying/watching videos (alex/course/podcasts/etc).

Even though I actually do LESS in terms of sitting in front of the computer and working, the results are better, because I feel like I KNOW better what I need to do.
[15.07.24, 21:55:01] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Thanks for the answers very valuable! Will implement this and try for myself!🙏🏼
[16.07.24, 2:37:59] ~ Adonis A: Anyone here using gems pages or pagefly on Shopify? Been testing with Shopify product pages first and then transitioning to advertorials. Do you guys test immediately with advertorials ?
[16.07.24, 3:44:59] ~ Kevin kreative: @⁨~Chris Koh⁩
[16.07.24, 3:53:15] ~ Chris Koh: Yes of course, at GemPages team we ship advertorial templates bi-weekly, feel free yo check it out
[16.07.24, 3:53:43] ~ Adonis A: Will do! Thanks guys

[16.07.24, 5:07:57] ~ Kamal: Health niche
[16.07.24, 5:10:09] ~ Jeb: Ok gotcha, interesting, I’m in the high risk health space and I haven’t had any issues
[16.07.24, 5:10:53] ~ Jeb: High risk like CBD
[16.07.24, 5:16:30] ~ Kamal: I see, how long have you been selling? We’ve been on TT shop for 2 months so far and this is the first time we hear anything
[16.07.24, 5:21:06] ~ Jeb: Not that long, but before that I have run ads on TikTok to my shopify without any issues for a year. Our TikTok rep knows what we sell and everything Maybe their terms of service are more strict on tt shop then their ads

[16.07.24, 8:13:09] ~ Sonu Duhra: Andrew Carnegie: 8 hours, sleep 8 hours work and 8 hours opportunity time. I used to do work work work all the time, but now i am doing less work but getting more things done since I am doing more opportunity time. Opportunity time could be anything like reading, watching valuable content, team meetings or meditation
[16.07.24, 8:13:46] ~ Sonu Duhra: @⁨~Jonathan Lindberg⁩
[16.07.24, 11:54:43] ~ RS: Hey! Can you suggest or give Contacts of funnelish funnel editors who can just clone other funnels for me?
[16.07.24, 12:24:55] ~ David B: Hey guys. There will be no copy call today. I'm in the Philippines traveling. 

If you have a copy question or need copy advice, DM me and I'll get right back to you.
[16.07.24, 12:25:28] ~ David B: Cc. @⁨~Thomas Quinteros⁩
[16.07.24, 13:05:04] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Hey guys, urgent question. 

Our stripe just got shut down for a bullshit reason "payments without consent".

Anyway to stop stripe refunding all cc payments?
[16.07.24, 13:11:16] Yaniv: you used funnelish?
[16.07.24, 13:11:42] ~ Jeremy Leppink: yes
[16.07.24, 13:25:08] ~ Henry: Hi everyone! I'm new to ESS but this place already feels like one of the best communities to be in already. Here to work hard, listen and hopefully provide my own knowledge to help others as well once I gain more experience ❤️
[16.07.24, 13:29:44] ~ Sonu Duhra: https://www.fiverr.com/muhammad_osman He is very good and fast
[16.07.24, 13:44:29] Yaniv: funnelish checkout pages are non-compliant thats the main reason behind it
[16.07.24, 13:45:19] Yaniv: and upsells very sketchy, it comes with a “price” of risk of getting banned from Stripe.
[16.07.24, 13:46:17] ~ RS: Not 100% sure. I had 2 bans from stripe and I was able to unban it both times. Every time ban occured when I scaled. Used only funnelish and I even gave stripe my funnelish page explaining that it is sales funnel
Not main website. Also, a week ago stripe did a big review for my another store where Also I use funnelish. And again everything is good
[16.07.24, 13:47:08] Yaniv: it also depends on the product too, you got lucky but many others don’t keep that in mind.
[16.07.24, 14:17:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Oh really? interesting
[16.07.24, 14:17:19] ~ Jeremy Leppink: never heard that before
[16.07.24, 14:17:44] ~ Jeremy Leppink: @⁨~Y⁩ you have some tips & tricks on this perhaps?
[16.07.24, 14:17:47] Yaniv: Think about it , it make sense you are customize it yourself right? its wild wild west.
[16.07.24, 14:17:52] ~ Jeremy Leppink: ofcourse
[16.07.24, 14:18:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: but then again, what is there to consent to
[16.07.24, 14:19:11] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Filling in some info and paying through a secure payment processor
[16.07.24, 14:19:17] ~ Jeremy Leppink: some checkbox before hand that they consent?
[16.07.24, 14:19:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: maybe some added legal pages
[16.07.24, 14:19:44] Yaniv: My ban was very similar “non authorized payments processing of the clients” legal pages won’t help in this case.
[16.07.24, 14:20:00] ~ Jeremy Leppink: So basically a "i agree to the terms" checkbox
[16.07.24, 14:23:40] ~ Maxi: How about not using stripe
[16.07.24, 14:23:58] ~ Maxi: You can focus on growing you biz and not wether you are getting paid or not.
[16.07.24, 14:25:59] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Would be lovely
[16.07.24, 14:26:13] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Tried getting into a MOR, didnt allow me
[16.07.24, 14:26:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: HK is a another option on the table right now, or opening a sub entity under my main company
[16.07.24, 14:27:05] ~ Maxi: HK will be probably a pain in the ass with the fees + approval rates
[16.07.24, 14:27:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: yes sirr thats why thats last option for me hahah
[16.07.24, 14:27:28] ~ Jeremy Leppink: MoR is the preferred way
[16.07.24, 14:27:32] ~ Jeremy Leppink: For me at least
[16.07.24, 15:00:05] ~ G M: Which gateway are you using?
[16.07.24, 15:03:14] ~ Lachy Waldon: people using airwallex. What are you using for currency conversion?
[16.07.24, 15:17:18] Topi: Anyone running supplements in europe? Would ask about payment processing
[16.07.24, 15:18:15] ~ Mikael: The currency conversion doesnt convert in shopifys checkout which is abit sad. but atleast it converts in airwallex when they are gono pay
[16.07.24, 16:39:26] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey brand builders, I’ve had a TON of ppl asking me about advertorials, how to write the copy for them, build them out, etc. Just out of curiosity… if I had my internal team personally write and build you a fully done-for-you advertorial from start to finish, would this be something you’re interested in? If so, just emoji this message!

If there's any interest in this at all, I'm only gonna open 5 spots for this because the quality of these advertorials will be top notch. They will be written personally by one of my own A-list copywriters, and we'll build you a fully functional funnel for you on funnelish too.

Again, if you're interested, just emoji this message and I’ll reach out with details!
[16.07.24, 16:59:43] ~ Y: Funnelish checkouts are compliant! After all they are custom pages you can build them to be compliant or non-compliant.

Funnelish itself is partnered with Stripe.

If a certain page was the cause of the ban, share more details about the page will review it and see what we can do to help from our end.

I would urge anyone that’s collected SEPA debit or similar in Europe that they should add mandate text to their upsells or checkout, (eg. By clicking xyz you agree to our…etc)
[16.07.24, 17:20:04] ~ RS: Do you turn off “Multi advetiser ads” for you scaling campaigns?
[16.07.24, 17:57:37] ~ Santi Roa: Oh this happened to me once. I called them up. They stopped it but i don't remember what I told them or what proof they asked me
[16.07.24, 18:27:16] ~ Allan L: How did you Call them?
[16.07.24, 18:48:33] ~ Jeb: Hi everyone, curious. Can your credit card processors even tell if you’re using funnelish in any way since it’s a sub domain of your Shopify’s URL? I’m wondering if i should ask my credit card processor first or just do it without asking?
[16.07.24, 19:31:35] ~ Santi Roa: Idk they had the support phone somewhere it was very very easy
[16.07.24, 19:55:27] ~ Allan L: Hmm okay.
[16.07.24, 19:56:30] ~ Lachy Waldon: i think they’ve been cracking down. Same thing happened to me with an established business of over a year ago
[16.07.24, 19:56:38] ~ Allan L: Can you check if you Can see their number? I cant find anything about it
[16.07.24, 19:56:39] ~ Lachy Waldon: 60k as well

[16.07.24, 20:00:59] ~ Allan L: I only get Email option there :/
[16.07.24, 20:01:31] ~ RS: If your acc is banned, you cannot call or Get in live chat
[16.07.24, 20:01:39] ~ RS: You have only email as an option
[16.07.24, 20:01:50] ~ Allan L: hmm that would make sense I guess.
[16.07.24, 20:03:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: and then they dont respond to the email
[16.07.24, 20:03:07] ~ Jeremy Leppink: how nice
[16.07.24, 20:03:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 😂
[16.07.24, 20:03:39] ~ Allan L: yup.. not even informing about how long the hold is anywhere..

[16.07.24, 20:49:58] ~ L: Is ADS Manager loading slowly for you guys - it's taking ages for me to load every page
[16.07.24, 23:00:51] ~ Patrycja: Hi does anyone know how to connect funnelish with authorize net gateway?
[16.07.24, 23:23:40] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, I’m running into a problem and hope there is someone here who has experienced this before. 

Currently I am doing business from Europe (Netherlands) and using Stripe. This year I will move to Dubai and am working on a payment processing structure. Now I am going to open a UK LLC for collecting, on which I will run Stripe in European countries. Only with this I cannot run in UK itself, as I will have to pay UK TAXES. Also I have a problem that I cannot open PayPal on my EU entity, as I am permanently blocked here. So I don't know what options there are. I hear a lot around me to open a HK entity on a nominee, but I also hear a lot of stories that this does not always go well. 

Anyone experience with this and what are the options?
[16.07.24, 23:41:10] Matán Intsuper: Depends where are your main clients
[16.07.24, 23:41:29] Matán Intsuper: In terms of PayPal there’s an insider that can unblock your PayPal
[16.07.24, 23:42:06] Matán Intsuper: Or just create a new PayPal under your new entity
[16.07.24, 23:52:43] Carlos Leeseman: Still in Europe
[16.07.24, 23:53:04] Carlos Leeseman: Hmm will this be a short term solution or long term? Could you connect me with a insider?
[16.07.24, 23:53:20] Matán Intsuper: I don’t know I never tried this service
[16.07.24, 23:53:28] Carlos Leeseman: They will still regonize my name and brand name I think
[17.07.24, 1:20:18] ~ Joshua: Does anybody have a way to do price testing that isn't $500 a month from intelligems?
[17.07.24, 1:37:21] ~ Jacobo Uribe: A/B Convert is amazing, it starts at $49/mo
[17.07.24, 8:19:49] ~ Y: Currently not possible, pls request it from chat support to be prioritized in our roadmap
[17.07.24, 11:34:22] ~ Allan L: Is it possible to custom code with something like Airwallex and funnelish?
[17.07.24, 11:44:38] ~ Y: It would be very hard to custom code especially when it comes to tracking orders etc, just request it from support, the more merchants that request any feature the sooner it’s done
[17.07.24, 11:45:30] Carlos Leeseman: Okay let’s request it everyone 😂
[17.07.24, 11:49:08] ~ Allan L: Let the power of ESS avail !
[17.07.24, 14:42:11] Topi: Hey team,

Today was supposed to be a VSL call.

Unfortunately it’s canceled due to high fever.

Send me any questions privately please.

Cu next week!
[17.07.24, 16:47:20] ~ Santiago: Hey guys, do you know any good company that helps with getting ITINs ?

[17.07.24, 19:36:08] ~ Mikael: Anyone who recently split tested the Shopify native checkout 1 page vs 3 page? Whats the results?
[17.07.24, 19:39:22] ~ Santi Roa: I did it a long time ago. 3 page was better
[17.07.24, 19:39:49] ~ Mikael: Still running 3 page? What was the difference in your opinion?
[17.07.24, 19:40:39] ~ Santi Roa: Still running 3 page yeah. I don't remember exactly because my team does that, but I remember the difference was significant (like 20% or something)
[17.07.24, 19:40:53] ~ Santi Roa: I have a crazy day today but will try to find the data later
[17.07.24, 19:41:29] ~ Mikael: yeah.. I just made a small test now but My sales are abit too low and not enought stable to make a real decision I feel.

At the same time I feel like the 3 page was better. but dont know for usre
[17.07.24, 19:44:49] ~ Mikael: Atleast it "feels" like the 3 page is not worse than the 1 page. which is weird.
[17.07.24, 20:02:11] ~ Alex: same for me
[17.07.24, 20:04:29] ~ Mikael: Anyone who recently tested the checkout?
[17.07.24, 20:10:07] ~ Ignasi: Same here
[17.07.24, 21:19:35] ~ Natasha Iris: Friendly reminder for today’s payments call!  

Hey everyone, look forward to chatting on today’s payments call!  

Having issues with Stripe / PayPal / Klarna, etc? Recently, we helped save a Stripe closure and stopped them from refunding 18k worth of transactions within 2 business days for an ESS member!  Also a locked PayPal account for 2 years we got up and running today 🙏🏼

We will also discuss recovering after a large chargeback hit. 

See you all on the payments call! 🚀

[18.07.24, 10:35:41] ~ Malik: Hi guys, what is your best setup to use PayPal at high scale ? open a HK company ? Your own and accept the % on hold ? Rent a PayPal from HK ?
[18.07.24, 10:35:43] ~ Malik: thank you
[18.07.24, 10:41:24] Matán Intsuper: You just need to contact an accountant in the uk
[18.07.24, 10:41:38] Matán Intsuper: He will do the process for you
[18.07.24, 12:46:31] René Crooijmans: Who has fulfilled orders through Amazon while waiting for the first batch of stock for a new offer?

Don't want to pause my ads & the product can't be dropshipped, only bought in bulk.

Is it doable?


[18.07.24, 12:56:57] ~ Santi Roa: What's your lead time? Last Q4 I run out of stock and was selling about 5k units per day.
I slowed down advertising (definitely do it, otherwise you will have a bigger problem in a few weeks). And then we switched to FBM and shipped orders from our US warehouse
[18.07.24, 12:57:18] ~ Santi Roa: Because amazon was taking about a month to process an inbound order. They also lost me about 2k units
[18.07.24, 12:57:24] ~ Santi Roa: So it was CRAZY
[18.07.24, 12:57:53] ~ Santi Roa: We eventually had to turn off ads. Doing 250k/day profitably 🥲🥲
[18.07.24, 12:58:44] ~ Santi Roa: So just be careful and forecast correctly. Maybe it's better to just slow down on sales and not risk the amazon account, customer reputation, etc
[18.07.24, 13:02:01] René Crooijmans: The lead time is around 25-30 days 
[18.07.24, 13:02:05] René Crooijmans: Crazy. That sounds like an intense period
[18.07.24, 13:03:14] René Crooijmans: What do you think about leaving the ads on on a minimal budget (let's say just $100 a day) and fulfill from a competitor listing? This way we can at least continue optimizing the funnel while waiting for the stock.
[18.07.24, 13:13:33] ~ Santi Roa: And you have 0 product to ship? 30 days to get the products made in china right? Plus 30 day freight or well, 14 days via air?
[18.07.24, 13:14:58] ~ Santi Roa: I’m not an expert on this topic anyways so I don’t know what to say about it. Maybe it works without any problems… But you’ll probably be losing money purchasing the product from a competitor, and giving his listing more relevance
[18.07.24, 13:15:02] ~ Santi Roa: idk
[18.07.24, 13:15:42] ~ Santi Roa: Personally, I would take the hit, turn everything off, feel dumb for not calculating inventory properly, cry for a while, learn the lesson, build a stronger logistics/forecasting system, and come back stronger.

You can also try to find other supplier with stock of the product on hand ‎<This message was edited>
[18.07.24, 13:18:23] René Crooijmans: Yup - 0 as it's a new test, only started it a few days ago
[18.07.24, 13:18:48] René Crooijmans: All good thank you for the input. Going to dig deeper to see if there are other suppliers with stock on hand first

[18.07.24, 17:27:17] ~ Ecomcesar: Have you experienced higher CPMs during last 2 days ?
[18.07.24, 17:27:24] ~ Ecomcesar: I have an increase of about 50%
[18.07.24, 17:27:38] ~ Ecomcesar: Anyone also facing high cpms?
[18.07.24, 17:27:41] ~ Ecomcesar: In USA
[18.07.24, 17:28:17] ~ RS: My cpms are high in US for the past month 😀 120-180$
[18.07.24, 17:43:27] ~ Thomas Quinteros: It's a common phenomenon due to the political situation that has been going on
[18.07.24, 17:46:46] Radek: probably due to Prime day sales
[18.07.24, 19:18:09] ~ Adonis A: Hey guys 
 Do you usually test new products in big 4 or just 1 country.  I see in phase 6 of the course they recommend not to run ads to multiple countries from the same ad account. But our product is also very competitive with 1 competitor spending over 2m/mo
[18.07.24, 20:13:46] ~ Henry: Yep I am too
[18.07.24, 20:15:39] ~ Henry: It affects all niches?
[18.07.24, 21:15:56] ~ RS: Are orders for you generating in shopify from funnelish now? Orders stopped generating in shopify 2hrs ago. For my other store, orders were generated with a delay

[18.07.24, 22:20:05] ~ Y: Not aware of any issues at all, orders sync just fine. Seen in the past where Shopify does not update their dashboard for up to 6h, and then orders come in suddenly all at once, very rare though and happens on individual accounts rather than all.
[18.07.24, 22:26:32] Amit Wadhawan: Same for me. They synced all at once after a 2 hour lag.
[19.07.24, 12:50:54] ~ Luka: Anyone experienced with IP Protection? What should we look for when deciding on an IP firm? 

We have a guy from China file a patent of our exact logo 7 days before we did (it'll take a while to approve either of us) and we will be filing an opposition to it plus probably we will engage in legal action for copyright (literally ripped our logo, packaging, images etc) just to add extra pressure, which actually is jail time for up to 6 months in my country so can use that as leverage for them to drop the patent claim. They seem to have an operation here locally so that's an option as well.

Basically when choosing IP firms, we have 2 brackets
A) Hire a big IP Firm that's global and has an office locally 
B) Hire a local firm specific to our country
[19.07.24, 13:25:05] ~ Santi Roa: I would work with a Chinese lawyer directly. Not an international firm
[19.07.24, 13:26:58] ~ Ignasi: It might be cheaper to buy in from them. In our case, that’s what we did

In this last Period I am testing a lot of creativity on Facebook but still the campaigns are very unstable. Do you also have the same feeling?
[19.07.24, 13:38:17] ~ Luka: It’s not in China though. It’s a Chinese person registered the claim in my country so it’s in my country’s law
[19.07.24, 13:38:58] ~ Luka: That’s an option as well. Was thinking of that, or a rebrand if we have no legal claim. Costly but an option as well

Now i need to fix score for some of my pages too. 

Can anyone recommend someone to fix feedback score for reasonable price?

[21.07.24, 22:46:07] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Have you tried Vitals upsells? Or do you mean post-purchase?

We actually do not use any post-purchase, only on our funnels, but on our store, no post-purchase yet:/
[21.07.24, 22:46:22] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Isn't this like the main selling point of the shopify plan upgrades?

[21.07.24, 22:47:00] ~ Lachy Waldon: costing us 15k+/ month

[21.07.24, 23:40:54] Topi: @⁨‪+47 973 16 810‬⁩ drilling into root cause why this happens
[21.07.24, 23:41:26] Topi: Short term fix buying feedback or new page but it just keeps happening if people are not happy
[21.07.24, 23:41:39] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: This was from before when we had really bad customer support and no branding on the product, but post-changes, we use this page that is at 3.3 score, this is the issue.
[21.07.24, 23:42:25] Topi: So you improved customer experience and score got better?
[21.07.24, 23:42:35] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: We make customer return the product to China, if they want to return it, maybe that is the reason?
[21.07.24, 23:42:44] ~ Santi Roa: Yeah feedback score really afects how Facebook treats your account.

I really can’t believe how some people is spending money to buy feedback or doing some crazy set up with 20 fanpages to solve the feedback score problem.
Feedback score is a metric, not a problem. You’re getting measured on how good you’re doing as a company/brand. If you suck, be grateful FB is telling you before the market tells you. So now you have time to act on it
There’s usually a big foundational problem but is easy to solve:

Sell better products
Ship faster
Improve Customer Support
[21.07.24, 23:43:46] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: I dropship from China, but using a sourcing agent. Maybe that is why? The shipping with Yunexpress to my country is 2 weeks though, and that is the fastest possible they can do, and any other agent can do that I have tried.
[21.07.24, 23:43:52] ~ Santi Roa: Improving Customer Experience (support) is more than just replying quick to emails. Is actually solving their problems, fast, and leaving people very happy about the experience with the brand. 
there are tons of reasons why people can be unhappy. Just start listening to them, surveying, and prioritizing solutions to the issues
[21.07.24, 23:44:43] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: wow, never thought about it this way actually, understood, thank you Santi
[21.07.24, 23:44:46] ~ Santi Roa: Don’t feel bad for not having an extremely great CX for now. Just make sure you act on that, you plan long term on how you will slowly improve these things
[21.07.24, 23:45:44] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: exactly, will start by improving product quality more, it is fine for now, but it can be better, we have custom packaging and user manuals all native as well, but the 2 week shipping i think is a problem, but we let them know on all our funnels and on our shopify store of this, we also let them know in post-purchase e-mails
‎[21.07.24, 23:45:52] ~ Santi Roa: ‎image omitted
[21.07.24, 23:47:02] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: But you only run from one page? ‎<This message was edited>
[21.07.24, 23:47:12] ~ Santi Roa: It took us a few years to slowly nail all the “wish to have” things. Such as faster shipping, great product experience, good marketing, solid team, etc etc
[21.07.24, 23:47:17] ~ Santi Roa: yeah
[21.07.24, 23:47:39] ~ Santi Roa: Well actually we do have some other “fake-pages” to test stuff under our brand. Let me check those
[21.07.24, 23:48:42] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: can you explain what you mean by "good marketing" and "good team"? 

More in depth, so I can learn please.
[21.07.24, 23:48:55] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Ok, understood!
‎[21.07.24, 23:49:45] ~ Santi Roa: ‎image omitted
[21.07.24, 23:51:00] ~ Santi Roa: I just wanted to generalize a TON of things haha but I meant to have the best marketing we could imagine having. To be like the brands we admire. 
To have the best ads, to have the best website, to do the best organic marketing, to run the best offline campaigns, etc

And good team goes together with everything else. It evolves in each stage
[21.07.24, 23:51:23] ~ Santi Roa: At some point for me having “a good team” was to have 10 people, fully delated all my operational things (video editing, media buying, copy, etc)
[21.07.24, 23:51:24] Amit Wadhawan: YunExpress has a faster shipping line you can you for a few more dollars that gives you 7-10 day shipping. Ask your agent about that and make the switch. Makes a big difference in CX.
[21.07.24, 23:52:31] ~ Santi Roa: Now having a “Great team” is more about having a senior team of directors and strategists that lead the rest of my people. Having a solid team that can execute on the level I want to be (let’s say as brands like Glossier, Hexclad, Ridge, Allbirds, etc)
[21.07.24, 23:53:14] ~ Santi Roa: What I meant before is that be patient but make sure you are moving all the levers, leveling up in different parts of your biz. Not just ads/LPs.
[22.07.24, 8:30:49] ~ Henry: Hey guys, for advertising to different countries, is it recommended to sell only 1 country per ad account? I want to run to all English speaking countries and not sure if I should have them all set up in the same account
[22.07.24, 8:35:21] ‪+39 328 838 6044‬: Hi! What do you use to check the score?
[22.07.24, 9:50:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: In your BM, go to business support home
[22.07.24, 9:50:51] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Then click your page
[22.07.24, 10:47:28] Radek: You've mentioned Hexclad and Ridge, so I can highly recommend this weekly podcast, where CEO's of RIdge, Hexclad, Simple Modern discuss daily stuff, but also long term strategy, vision etc. It's really valuable to see how they think, evaluate things and make decisions. https://www.youtube.com/@Operators9/videos
[22.07.24, 12:33:09] ~ Allan L: Anyone got a guy for pagespeed? Shopify/PageFly
[22.07.24, 14:29:47] ~ Santi Roa: Oh yeah, it's one of the best ecom podcasts out there.
Matt Bertulli mentors me 1-1 since January. He's not taking more people, but I highly recommend being suscribed to his newsletter
[22.07.24, 14:45:56] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Any ways to put upsell orders on same order on Funnelish?

We got like 3-4 order and when customers open a disputes that increase a lot
[22.07.24, 14:47:14] Topi: Bundling time 15 minutes
[22.07.24, 14:47:14] Topi: Works for us @⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩ , 90% come in 1 order
[22.07.24, 14:53:24] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Thank you very much bro
[22.07.24, 15:01:59] ~ Maxi: Is it also 1x credit card charge only for the customer  ?
[22.07.24, 15:04:41] Topi: Im not 100% sure, I think with credit card the gateaway stays open like 15 minutes (depending on processor) and all purchases within that timeframe go into one order. But im not 100% sure, someone wiser can correct me
[22.07.24, 15:06:20] ~ Maxi: @⁨~Y⁩ Could you help us out here and clarify If the customers get billed in only 1x credit card charge even if they buy multiple upsells but we set the timer to 15 minutes bundling time

[22.07.24, 18:26:28] ~ RS: For me from what I have seen, every upsell order counts as a seperate transaction in stripe (the same should be for other payment processors), so the customer can file a dispute for each transaction
[22.07.24, 18:26:52] Matán Intsuper: thanks @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩ for sharing, good value here

[22.07.24, 21:05:05] ~ Y: send me your upsell and checkout url, my guess, is that perhaps some of the upsell YES buttons are pointing to wrong products or not setup properly
[22.07.24, 21:08:18] Carlos Leeseman: How do you guys track your your monthly expenses and and team expenses? I have a really good P&L sheets for my daily weekly and monthly profits of my revenue etc, but I need something to keep track of my daily expenses, montly expenses and team expenses. for example, my agency costs, the people in my team, subscriptions, stuff like that
[22.07.24, 21:11:41] China Bigboss: i use money manager and its work for me perfect

[23.07.24, 6:24:57] ~ seth: Hi guys, does anyone know a good way to build analytic dashboard with checkout champ? their analytic is not very visable and if I want a metric it would take me 2-3 click to get it which is annoying.
[23.07.24, 9:34:19] Bob: When you guys decide to start with branding of your products, is this something you usually just talk about with your agent in China or do you try and contact other suppliers/factories yourself on like Alibaba to be able to negotiate more and get better options?
[23.07.24, 11:18:23] ~ Maxi: Guys anyone here who has contact to mercury rep ? 

They want to close our mercury bank account we need to fix it asap
[23.07.24, 12:51:49] ~ seth: Anyone successfully edit their order confirmation email on shopify? I tried myself with chatgpt but it's not work
[23.07.24, 13:00:29] ~ Powa: Edit it on klaviyo then export to shopify
[23.07.24, 13:01:07] ~ seth: Thanks man I'll try it now
[23.07.24, 13:53:38] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: Anyone running advertorials,listicles any pre sale page on gempages? How do you track the results? Looking to start testing.
[23.07.24, 15:45:38] ~ Kevin Krieg: We use Triplewhlae for it. Good for live overview of all these expenses. But they also have great exports. So can build nice Sheet dashboard really simple with it. I love it
[23.07.24, 16:17:55] ~ L: Guys, have you noticed that using a US LLC to sell in Europe via Stripe/Shopify Payments leads to a significant number of declined payments?

Is this something we should worry about now that we're testing, or later before scaling?

I don't want to create the whole structure for the EU without being sure the brand is scalable there

[24.07.24, 19:34:30] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Some noob questions: 

I am hiring my first ever media buyer, is 25USD per hour a good hourly rate to offer him, and increase it based on his skills / experience as a media buyer? 

In addition, how do I give him access to the FB ads manager? Must I give him access via FB business manager?
[24.07.24, 19:43:43] ~ Nils: Personally I would just do a monthly retainer and KPI’s to hit for bonuses. Hours worked is a vanity metric in my opnion, results are what matters
[24.07.24, 19:44:23] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: But for monthly retainer, how do I know what to pay him?
[24.07.24, 19:45:06] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: For KPIs to hit for bonuses, do you mean like what ROAS he should be achieving, based on our marketing budget?
[24.07.24, 19:45:50] ~ Nils: align your incentives
[24.07.24, 19:46:19] ~ Nils: calculate how much you are willing to spend to aquire customers at different spend levels
[24.07.24, 19:47:45] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: As for monthly retainer, do you think 3k USD per month is good for a media buyer? @⁨~Nils⁩
[24.07.24, 19:48:10] ~ Nils: and reward him if he hits those numbers that is scaling the business profitably
[24.07.24, 19:48:28] ~ Nils: its depenss on the spend level and experience i’d say
[24.07.24, 19:49:02] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: we spend 1.5k USD per day, so quite a low spend
[24.07.24, 19:50:13] ~ Nils: okay yeah 3k i’d say should be sufficient. in my opinion 80% of the results come from creating really good ads/advertorials/vsls/ copywriting so dont place too too mich emphasis on the media buying part ‎<This message was edited>
[24.07.24, 19:50:54] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: for sure, i understand, it's mostly because I do not want to allocate my own time to do MB anymore, as I can get much higher ROI for my time with, as you said: ads/advertorials/vsls/ copywriting
[24.07.24, 19:51:11] ~ Nils: yessir thats the right way to think
[24.07.24, 19:51:27] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Thank you so much for the help man, jumping into the interview now:)
[24.07.24, 19:51:34] ~ Nils: 👍👍
[24.07.24, 19:52:43] ~ Nils: i would love to create a split test with 1 brand in the future, no media buyer VS media buyer. And see if the fb algo can outperform. Just doing 1-2 campaigns and giving all freedom to fb
[24.07.24, 21:04:52] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: When you hire for your companies, how do you generate employee contracts, or do you at all? Like when you hire for a monthly retainer, because I have never made something like this before.
[24.07.24, 21:08:07] ~ Santiago: Chatgpt it
[24.07.24, 21:08:41] ~ Santiago: I once paid my lawyer 2k to come up with different agreements
[24.07.24, 21:08:55] ~ Santiago: Then compare with chatgpt output and is pretty similar
[24.07.24, 21:09:05] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: @⁨~Santiago⁩ But do you do this when you hire any individual in your company? Like I cannot even enforce this contract if the person I am hiring is abroad, which they always are anyway
[24.07.24, 21:09:26] ~ Santiago: I now use chat gpt and then put a lawyer assistant to proofread it ‎<This message was edited>
[24.07.24, 21:09:45] ~ Santiago: From what i understand you need to have a jurisdiction clause ‎<This message was edited>
[24.07.24, 21:16:49] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: ok i see, i will do this then, so just tell chatgpt to generate it then paste it into an app where the person can sign, then good to go? hiring a media buyer, my first one, so this is what its for really

[24.07.24, 21:20:10] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: "jurisdiction clause" do you mean if the employee does not do the work they are paid to do? As in, to enforce them having to follow the agreement, you would need a contract?
[24.07.24, 21:20:31] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: They are from 3rd world countries anyway, so how would I even legally enforce the contract if the person is so far away?
[24.07.24, 21:20:44] ~ Santiago: Ah okay for that you would need to add an specific clause
[24.07.24, 21:22:04] ~ Santiago: @⁨‪+47 973 16 810‬⁩ send over a draft of what you need, obligations, etc

[25.07.24, 22:45:15] ~ Richie: ATC when someone visits sales page and IC when they hit checkout page
[25.07.24, 22:45:34] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Is this done via software? I will watch the course actually, thanks Richie!

[25.07.24, 22:56:07] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: have you used this as metrics to judge for a long time?
[25.07.24, 23:00:14] ~ Richie: Yes always. If I know 1 in 10 people that hit the checkout convert and my target CPA is $50 then I’m shooting for no less than a $5 cost per initiate checkout

[26.07.24, 11:01:51] ~ Erik Pecovnik: anyones meta ads performing weird last fed days?
[26.07.24, 13:15:24] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Yep, no idea why:(
[26.07.24, 13:16:16] ~ Tom: Yeah mine have just randomly stopped spending
[26.07.24, 13:25:06] ~ Alex: Happened to me with adtiger yesterday

They said meta are restricting a lot of stable accounts to 0 daily spend
[26.07.24, 13:31:47] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Hey guys!

What app do you recommend for post purchase upsells on shopify? Our shopify store does not have any post purchase upsells yet. 

We tried aftersell, but since we have Klarna as a main payment processor, customers never get to see their post purchase upsells, as they are not compatible with Klarna, only with card / paypal.

Same goes for Zipify OCU.
[26.07.24, 15:00:05] ~ Nils: Yo! Any good resources on hiring and retaining talent?
[26.07.24, 15:10:08] Topi: Theres no solution for this afaik expect funnelish or checkout champ. Have tested countless of apps
[26.07.24, 15:10:41] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: So you do not upsell your customers when they pay with Klarna on your shopify store man? :((
[26.07.24, 15:10:55] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: So my best bet is aftersell then? So I can have a custom thank you page?
[26.07.24, 15:12:46] Topi: Checkout champ
[26.07.24, 15:13:27] Topi: Yes, thank you page works but obviously take rate is lower than ocu
[26.07.24, 15:14:10] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: checkout champ, is this not like funnelish? what does it have to do with upselling on shopify?
[26.07.24, 15:14:28] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: So OCU > aftersell if 70% of your sales are via Klarna?
[26.07.24, 15:17:07] Topi: Checkout champ lets you build custom checkout and upsell sequence. You replace your shopify checkout with it. Or you can also create even sales pages and advertorials with it. But must use custom html pages, the builder way too slow. In other words, you need good developer
[26.07.24, 15:18:26] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: and this works with shopify? what is the difference between checkout champ and funnelish?

i use funnelish but we have an organic shopify store where the traffic comes from google etc
[26.07.24, 15:19:13] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: so with checkout champ, you can build post purchase upsells that work with Klarna, and it replaces the shopify checkout in your already existing shopify store, Topi?
[26.07.24, 15:19:54] Topi: Checkout champ is much more versatile, you can do much more with it. Funnelish is like the junior version of it
[26.07.24, 15:20:55] Topi: Funnelish = very easy to use, lots of issues, very restricted

Checkout champ = extremely versatile, almost no limitations, very complex and hard to use
[26.07.24, 15:20:56] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: so bascially Funnelish is for the peasants and checkout champ is for the top dogs?
[26.07.24, 15:21:01] Topi: Lmao
[26.07.24, 15:21:50] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: so once i have a massive budget and long-term plan, it's best to hire a good developer and build checkout champ long-term for both organic shopify store, and for funnels?
[26.07.24, 15:21:57] Matán Intsuper: What can checkout champ do that Funnelish can’t ?
[26.07.24, 15:21:57] ~ RS: 😂
[26.07.24, 15:22:59] Topi: Build the pages exactly how you want, rotate payment processing, connect almost any processors
[26.07.24, 15:23:32] Topi: And they assign you an account manager whereas funnelish barely has any support
[26.07.24, 15:25:12] Topi: Well, i’d see what the top people in your niche are doing. For a fashion store i’d imagine checkout champ can get way too complex (?) whereas its perfect for supplement acquisition funnel
[26.07.24, 15:34:49] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: exactly
[26.07.24, 15:38:59] ~ Sonu Duhra: Hi everyone I want to hear your opinion about this, scaling twice a day, first scale in the morning based on yesterday performance and then in the afternoon based on today's performance. Reason behind this is that scaling based on yesterday is a gamble, today's performance could go both ways, that's why checking again in the afternoon. Let me know... @⁨~Richie⁩
[26.07.24, 15:44:59] ~ Richie: In my opinion every ad account is unique. Everything is dependent on your structure and amount of winning creatives you have. If you have 10+ winning creatives you have hedged your bet and decreased the risk of everything going flat one day. That’s the only time I personally would start playing with different scaling strategies that you come up with yourself , recording the data and split tests, then optimizing from there. We test the smallest things down to what hours of the day launching our scaling campaigns work the best
[26.07.24, 15:46:48] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey guys, anyone know how to have payout with Shopify Payement US in 2 days 

I have actual 5 days
[26.07.24, 15:49:18] ~ Richie: I’ve seen some ad accounts that budgets can’t be scaled, some that work scaling 25% every 3 days, some that can scale 100% everyday. Just all about testing and seeing what works best for you
[26.07.24, 16:21:58] ~ Malik: Hello guys, newbie question here : Is it possible to pay for invoices with an AMEX card ? I can't pay for my ads as a use an agency ad account and do wire transfers but if I can pay my transfers with an AMEX account I could earn points right ? Thx ‎<This message was edited>
[26.07.24, 17:56:55] ~ Henry: Yeah that’s tough because you need to get it verified by the state here so definitely not sure if this is possible for you. Maybe you can borrow an ad account from someone living in the US
[26.07.24, 20:25:06] ~ Musawer: Hey guys have a quick question.

How much do you pay your VA's from philipines on avarage?
[26.07.24, 20:40:53] ‪+972 50‑755‑7706‬: Hey guys, looking for some senior video editors 

If you know someone I would appreciate an intro🙏🏼
[26.07.24, 22:02:03] ~ Jan: Do you know about any solution to recover the adpsend?
[27.07.24, 13:26:40] ~ Luka: When you take down a TikTok shop product for using your copyright photos... does their listing get completely deleted? Or can tehy just upload new photos and continue with their listing
[27.07.24, 20:58:28] ~ Bony Ghadiya: you can get agency accounts where they let you can add your own card!
[27.07.24, 23:38:19] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey, did you apply for the US Amex Business Gold as US LLC owner?
[28.07.24, 1:32:20] ~ Adonis A: Anyone know a tik tok shops/affiliates agency or expert? It’s for an 8 figure supplement brand
[28.07.24, 15:50:17] Matán Intsuper: C-corp owner
[28.07.24, 19:18:53] Alex  Fedotoff: https://cal.com/samhabibi/30min this guy knows his stuff
[29.07.24, 0:01:52] ~ Kim Romanov: Did they ask for SSN/ITIN to apply for a credit card?
[29.07.24, 0:16:24] Matán Intsuper: I have an itin so I used it instead of Ssn but I heard it’s possible without any
[29.07.24, 0:20:43] ~ Kim Romanov: Thanks for the reply. Last question, did you already have credit history or credit cards in the US when you applied for this card?
[29.07.24, 0:20:57] ~ Kim Romanov: I opened a US LLC a month ago, still waiting for an ITIN and don't want unnecessary hard inquiries to my credit history in the US
[29.07.24, 0:40:08] ~ Tarlan: Hey guys, @⁨~Alex⁩ @⁨~Tom⁩ @⁨~Jan⁩ have you found a solution to get ad account back to start spending again? The main agency account I’ve been using for a long time without any issues totally stopped spending since Thursday. The agency told me that they are still waiting for Meta's decision on the appeal, but I am trying to figure out if there is anything I can do to get my ad account back faster.
[29.07.24, 0:45:20] Matán Intsuper: Yes I had a secured credit card from Bank of America
[29.07.24, 0:46:43] ~ Kim Romanov: Got it. Thanks 🙏
[29.07.24, 2:12:42] ~ Alex: Nope nothing unfortunately, should have an update tomorrow

It helps to have backup accounts and build up spend on them, that’s what we are using for now
[29.07.24, 5:44:25] ~ David B: Hey everyone. There will be no copy call tomorrow. I am travelling to Boracay. 

If you have any copywriting questions or you need support, please DM me and I'll get back to you.
[29.07.24, 5:44:26] ~ David B: Thanks all.
[29.07.24, 7:57:53] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, anyone using airwallex? I have a question 🙏
[29.07.24, 8:48:18] ~ Jan: Neither here. Our agency also waiting for meta decision on the appeal. We are focusing on backup accounts
[29.07.24, 9:32:12] ~ Tom: Yeah I’m using Aurora and they said they are waiting to hear back from Meta. Still not spending at all
[29.07.24, 12:06:02] ~ Facundo: Hey guys, any tip to upload heavy files (VSL´s) faster to the fb ads manager?
[29.07.24, 12:06:23] Carlos Leeseman: Hire Media Buyer or VA
[29.07.24, 12:06:36] Carlos Leeseman: Like it takes you so much time, not worth it
[29.07.24, 12:08:17] ~ Maxi: Our editor just uploads it after he’s done
[29.07.24, 12:08:28] ~ Maxi: In Bulk
[29.07.24, 12:08:50] ~ Maxi: Just make sure the person who uploads it has good wifi
[29.07.24, 12:10:09] ~ Facundo: Thanks 👍
[29.07.24, 12:32:45] René Crooijmans: You can compress the video file size using Handbrake, you can cut it in half without losing any video quality usually
[29.07.24, 12:33:59] René Crooijmans: If you are using proxies, you can try uploading while connected to a VPN that's in the same location as the proxy server
[29.07.24, 12:34:30] René Crooijmans: Uploading max 5/6 at a time helps too
[29.07.24, 14:59:35] ~ Lachy Waldon: Anyway in here using a UK 3PL?

[30.07.24, 6:08:58] ~ Jeb: Hi @⁨~Tarlan⁩ ,  i saw your post about an ad account ban. Obviously i don’t know what happened but when you get it back i have an idea for you that may be helpful.

I had a ton of ad accounts taken down in the past so we do the following. 

We set aside one entire ad account as our “Burner ad account” an ad account thats sole purpose is to test ads/ funnels that we’re 50/50 on if they will get approved / taken down from facebook etc. 

We upload the questionable ad/ funnel onto the burner ad account. If it gets unapproved, who cares your burner ad account takes the hit. 

If it gets approved, simply turn it off and upload it to your main ad account.
[30.07.24, 9:05:19] ~ Tarlan: Hey @⁨~Jeb⁩ , it’s a great idea!

I have 3 different ad accounts from 3 different BMs. But none of them performed like my current ad account which stopped spending. So I’m still hoping to get it back. 

But using one ad account as a burner account will definitely reduce the risk of account bans, I’ll try it. Thank you for sharing!

[30.07.24, 23:55:18] ~ Davi: No way to win, same for us, even if you send tracking or dispatching information and evidence that customer never contacted you..
[31.07.24, 0:03:16] Matán Intsuper: Basically the customer says ‘my card was stolen and used without my will’. In such case, the credit card company will refund the customer and cancel their card and provide them with a new one. So it doesn’t matter if you shipped the product, and no contact evidence even makes the case stronger. But even if customer did contact you and you can prove it, highly likely that you’ll lose.

I won some fraud chargebacks in the past but it’s very rare.

I assume you win them if the credit card company doesn’t believe the customer. ‎<This message was edited>

[31.07.24, 18:42:35] ~ Malik: Hi everyone, 

After having a shop banned by shopify can you use the same stripe account for new shops?

Can you use the same domain knowing that it is an external domain not purchased on shopify. 

What can I do to avoid detection? New IP mail phone? What else can I do?

Thanks
[31.07.24, 18:48:46] Matán Intsuper: What does being banned from Shopify have to do with stripe ?
[31.07.24, 19:05:32] ~ Powa: You can use the same Stripe account, but you need to switch to a new domain. Don’t use the one connected to the banned Shopify store. 

Use a new IP address, a new mac address, and a new credit/debit card that isn’t linked to the banned store. I’ve been banned from Shopify a few times, so this is just my personal experience.
[31.07.24, 20:03:31] ~ Mikael: What email systems do you guys use for customer support to have all different emails gathered on? We have many different stores. Would be good to have something more optimized than outlook

[31.07.24, 20:07:28] ~ Firass: they have a good range of integration options (shopify included) and of course lots of automation settings
[31.07.24, 20:09:06] ~ Firass: I heard gorgias is acutally the best out there for ecom stores but it costs you way more than freshdesk
[31.07.24, 20:32:23] ~ Mikael: Is gergias and freshdeck to combine all email support i to 1? Because its email system we are looking for right now
[31.07.24, 20:51:35] ~ Malik: Because when you connect your stripe shopify can recognize the api and know that it's you.
[31.07.24, 20:51:51] ~ Malik: OK good to know thank you

[1.08.24, 0:55:10] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Hey Legends! Quick tip :::::

YouTube Shorts ads are CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED

Sofar there was no way you can specifically select Youtube Shorts as a placement, now we do!

Huge supply demand problem on there

Similar to tiktok or Reels but better opportunities to go viral

Here's how you do it:

1. Create a Demand Gen campaign
2. Chose Video Ads
3. Choose where your videos show
4. Select shorts

Does anyone know a provider for YouTube agency ad accounts? Never advertised on youtube before, but our media buyer is perma banned, i think his IP or HWID.

So: 

What are general rules for him to be able to do the media buying? Use a proxy? What else? And what type of proxy? 

Any input appreciated!

[1.08.24, 18:00:12] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Also, did i understand it correctly that google agency account is the same for youtube and google?
[1.08.24, 18:43:25] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Hey brotha! There is no such thing as a youtube agency ads account.  Google is way better at catching circumvention than any other platform. 

The long term solution is he needs to close all accounts he is associated with after solving suspension on all accounts.

Short term solution:

- get new email, new pc, new network 
- ⁠use MCC or MCC hierarchy 

Try not to use VPN or proxy ever on google.
[1.08.24, 18:44:51] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Understood, will take the long-term solution as always, thank you so much for the detailed answer Bony!
[1.08.24, 18:46:36] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Or you can use short term solution to get started and build momentum - meanwhile you are working on long term solution simultaneously.

By the time all suspensions are solved, probably a couple weeks, your account will have enough momentum to be scaled right away - hopefully by q4

[2.08.24, 4:53:23] ~ Kim Romanov: Hi there! A question on US LLC taxes.
I live in Canada and have a corporation here for my store. But because of the high fees when receiving payments from the US market (3.5% internation fee + 30c + 1.5% currency conversion fee even when receiving payment in USD and payment to Wise in USD), i.e. a total of about 5.1% on each transaction, I decided to open an LLC in New Mexico, as recommended in the E-Commerce Tax Course, so that the Canadian corporation would be the managing corporation and the US LLC would be the operating one. An ESS participant shared with me that there can be double taxation of income in Canada when owning a US LLC, he said he had to close his US LLC because of this.

Is there anyone here with a similar bundle who lives in Canada. Or what is the tax situation when receiving payments on a US LLC in your country?

- I've even tried making a Loom video of all the proof - rejected.
- Original photo without edits (+ not cropped) - rejected

Anyone had the same issue and got it resolved? We want to focus a lot more on TikTok shop but he has ~300-400 purchases (many fake) which will just get people to buy from him and not us.

Plus there's a ton of other listings who ripped our images & videos

[5.08.24, 19:37:04] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Shopify offers loans, no?👀
[5.08.24, 19:38:56] ~ Giu: The amount we need to raise is bigger than what shopify can offer
[5.08.24, 19:39:39] ~ Bestfulfill—william: how much u need
[5.08.24, 19:50:06] ~ James: ‎~ María Clara Busca-Sust removed ~ James
[5.08.24, 19:41:41] ~ Giu: at least 100k, we need to cover costs for changing our warehouse from china to 3pl
[5.08.24, 19:42:28] ~ Bestfulfill—william: so its more for inventory right ?
[5.08.24, 19:43:38] ~ Santi Roa: Don't use shopify loans, they are fucking expensive
[5.08.24, 19:43:39] ~ Giu: mostly yes, we need also to add new organic products that cannot be shipped from china
[5.08.24, 19:43:57] ~ Giu: this is one of the reasons too
[5.08.24, 19:44:08] ~ Bestfulfill—william: talk with topi maybe
[5.08.24, 19:44:15] ~ Bestfulfill—william: we can work somehting out
[5.08.24, 19:45:03] ~ Santi Roa: I can intro you to a guy at Wayflyer that helped me out with 300k about 2 yrs ago. I did it just to try it out because I was scaling up and very tight on cash. The fees were reasonable
[5.08.24, 19:46:07] ~ Giu: how much interest did you pay?
[5.08.24, 19:48:21] Carlos Leeseman: I’m using Mxney. They gave me €480.000 with 8% interest
[5.08.24, 19:50:48] ~ Santi Roa: It's tricky because they advertise those fixed fee loans
‎[5.08.24, 19:51:03] ~ Santi Roa: ‎image omitted
[5.08.24, 19:51:14] ~ Santi Roa: I read this on a private ecom community a few months ago
‎[5.08.24, 19:53:01] ~ Santi Roa: ‎image omitted
[5.08.24, 19:53:04] Carlos Leeseman: That’s correct. You have several Tranches. I was skeptical at first, but it's a great product and they also offer good service for cash flow management
[5.08.24, 19:53:44] ~ Giu: So it’s fixed but on monthly basis
[5.08.24, 19:53:52] ~ Santi Roa: Yeah it was worth it in my case but this is why I can't tell the interest rate
[5.08.24, 19:54:08] Carlos Leeseman: 1 tranche is 4 months
[5.08.24, 19:54:24] Carlos Leeseman: I have like 4 tranches. So 16 months
[5.08.24, 19:54:38] ~ Bestfulfill—william: if its monthly i feel average should be more than 12%
[5.08.24, 19:55:20] ~ L: Guys, which app do you use for post-purchase upsell on Shopify? 

I've been using AfterSell for a while now, but I’ve noticed from the analytics that it only triggers 70% of the time, and for some reason, it doesn’t show up for nearly 30% of our customers.
[5.08.24, 19:55:49] Carlos Leeseman: And you payoff the loan with a percentage of your daily revenue. In my case it’s 10%. It’s based on your revenue and profits
[5.08.24, 19:56:33] ~ Giu: Ok, many thanks we’ll research also for your suggestion
[5.08.24, 19:57:02] ~ Chris Koh: is it because Shopify does not support multiple currencies in post purchase upsell?
[5.08.24, 19:57:13] ~ Giu: and we’ll see if it fits for our case too
[5.08.24, 19:57:49] ~ L: All of my customer are from Europe and they all pay in euros, so I don’t believe that’s the problem
[5.08.24, 19:58:18] ~ Firass: Do you sell with Klarna?
[5.08.24, 19:58:30] ~ L: Only Stripe and Paypal
[5.08.24, 19:58:41] ~ Firass: Bc Afrersell wont work with Klarna
[5.08.24, 19:58:48] ~ Firass: hmm
[5.08.24, 19:59:08] ~ Firass: I use Aftersell myself but never really had that issue
[5.08.24, 20:00:02] ~ L: Ok, thank you anyway. 

it never happened to me too , but it’s been over a week and no one from the customer care seem to find an actual solution
[5.08.24, 20:03:38] ~ Firass: To be honest with these kind of issues its probably the best option if you uninstall and install it again but I believe customer support already suggested that 😄
[5.08.24, 20:04:54] ~ Firass: because debugging it with the developer tool will only be helpful if aftersell devs do it and figure out the issue
[5.08.24, 20:08:33] ~ Ignasi: After sell is not compatible  with checkout extensibility — in case you’ve upgraded ‎<This message was edited>

[7.08.24, 1:40:22] ~ Alessandro: Hi guys
Anyone of you today have problem to pay the ads using mercury?
[7.08.24, 2:18:18] ~ Santi Roa: Nope
[7.08.24, 2:32:16] ~ Alessandro: I don’t know why fail the payments for meta
And mercury have no any task to do
[7.08.24, 3:16:38] China Bigboss: Did the card fail in meta or mercury rejected the payment?
[7.08.24, 3:17:14] ~ Alessandro: The card fail in meta
[7.08.24, 3:19:36] China Bigboss: Create another card in mercury block it for FB and try again sometimes meta didn't recognize the mercury debit card the number conflict with Russian 😂😂 Debit cards
[7.08.24, 9:25:53] Marek Olszewski: Yeah, same issue here
[7.08.24, 9:26:35] ~ Alessandro: You solved bro?
[7.08.24, 9:27:06] Marek Olszewski: Not yet, reaching out to mercury about it
[7.08.24, 9:27:28] Marek Olszewski: I created new cards, they wouldn’t work either
[7.08.24, 9:27:40] ~ Alessandro: Same
[7.08.24, 9:27:43] Marek Olszewski: But they work everywhere else, just not meta
[7.08.24, 9:31:24] ~ Maxi: What fixed the issue for me:

When adding the card, make sure that you are going from an IP that matches the BM / AD Account GEO.

If your BM / AD Account is US based try an US IP before logging in and adding the card.

I’ve had several issues with EU IPs in the past none of them actually worked, but everytime I logged in from an US proxy or IP it worked
[7.08.24, 9:35:16] ~ Alessandro: I’m using also an US ip address for my bm

Yesterday night we add a wise virtual card and it was working
[7.08.24, 9:35:58] ~ Alessandro: So I think the issue it’s meta with mercury 🤯
[7.08.24, 9:40:58] Marek Olszewski: Cards with significant spend stopped working all of a sudden, and after that every single new Mercury card. Cards from different vendors work all fine
[7.08.24, 9:41:51] ~ Maxi: Try WISE or Revolut, Mercury was also an issue for us
[7.08.24, 9:50:38] ~ Alessandro: For now we put a wise card. But that have a 45k spending limit per month
How to increase?

[7.08.24, 10:36:25] ~ Luka: The original campaign I made yesterday (~12 hrs ago) still has 2 "preparing" while 1 was getting traffic

Talk in there
[8.08.24, 18:18:49] ~ Alessandro: Has anyone today noticed a big drop on the ROAS?
[8.08.24, 18:25:44] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Yes, not sure why, since when are you seeing this, and on Meta or where?
[8.08.24, 18:26:27] ~ Alessandro: Since today on meta
[8.08.24, 18:27:03] ~ RS: Today my roas is highest in 7 days
[8.08.24, 18:28:16] Matán Intsuper: All good here in the last few days
[8.08.24, 18:29:22] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Looks like meta is testing more stuff for past 3 weeks
[8.08.24, 18:30:08] ~ Tom: I have also experienced a big drop today on Meta
[8.08.24, 18:32:09] ~ Alessandro: Revenue is like 50% less than yesterday
[8.08.24, 18:49:12] ~ Malik: and elections are coming
[8.08.24, 18:50:26] ~ Gabriel B ♠️: Hey guys, for those selling in two different languages: do you have two different stores for each of the languages, or do you use a translation app?
[8.08.24, 19:02:55] Topi: We use own store and domain for all countries. We tested with translating apps but couldnt make it work.
[8.08.24, 19:18:42] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I use both. If the currency is the same I use the same store and I edit some translations directly in the theme customization (loads faster) but for product pages we use Langify translation app and its very good
[8.08.24, 19:18:52] ~ Erik Pecovnik: what didnt work?
[8.08.24, 19:19:30] ~ Gabriel B ♠️: How about same country and different language?
[8.08.24, 19:20:00] ~ Gabriel B ♠️: How do you differentiate the audience for Klaviyo? How do you setup flows in the different languages for the different customers?
[8.08.24, 19:41:38] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Oh I dont have this situation. But I would “make up” another country and market for this specfic lanugage. For example I would create Italy market even if its not Italy, just so I have a slot where I can use different language. But then you need to hide language selector and make it automatic. Thats definetly not the best way to do it but it would get the job done
[8.08.24, 19:41:46] ~ Erik Pecovnik: maybe there are some apps that solves this
[8.08.24, 19:44:04] ~ Harvey: Those of you using Shopify this update with Gempages looks like it could be huge

[9.08.24, 17:18:23] ~ Erik Pecovnik: does anyone here have their own trained callers to confirm orders or correct addresses?
[9.08.24, 17:42:47] ~ Santi Roa: Wait, what’s your wrong address rate?
[9.08.24, 17:42:57] ~ Santi Roa: I mean, is it significant enough to call all your customers??
[9.08.24, 17:43:13] ~ Santi Roa: It sounds weird, I never heard anyone doing this to confirm orders. I do have some friends that have a call center to upsell stuff, or solve questions
[9.08.24, 17:44:33] ~ Santi Roa: In my case, our CX team built an app to allow people to manually modify the order, and it stops our fulfillment process and puts it on review until they send it. That help us with address modifications. 

We also customized the confirmation email to boldly say CHECK YOUR FUCKING ADDRESS MAKE SURE IT’S CORRECT
[9.08.24, 17:44:51] ~ Santi Roa: Of course it does not say that, but it’s kind of gross and very very protagonist in the confirmation email

[9.08.24, 18:04:53] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: It’s quite common practice to do it in COD markets because the customers don’t pay upfront so it’s always good to double check and you can upsell to them at the same time. And it works really well. We don’t have this implemented yet but will soon.
[9.08.24, 18:12:36] ~ Santi Roa: Oh I thought you sell in the US. I never sold in COD markets
[9.08.24, 18:12:53] ~ Santi Roa: Good point then. Sorry for expressing that it sounded weird. I just assumed you sold to the US or T5 ‎<This message was edited>
[9.08.24, 18:37:28] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I sell with COD so it makes sense, around 10% of customers dont leave house numbers
[9.08.24, 18:38:34] ~ Erik Pecovnik: we did the same, custom build page for callers to edit the orders
[9.08.24, 18:39:38] ~ Maxi: Guys which bank accounts are best for US LLC no us residents ?

Except Mercury
[9.08.24, 18:42:48] ~ Erik Pecovnik: is it okay to change links in a live adset? I know changing budget can fck up the performance but idk about the link (new domain)
[9.08.24, 18:43:14] ~ Facundo: Fucking COD 😂
Same problem here
[9.08.24, 18:43:47] ~ Imad: Rho.co

[9.08.24, 18:59:04] ~ Wouter Akika: Yes, that's the opening, but it's really just a sales call

About 20-25% of Acquisition revenue comes from this team
[9.08.24, 18:59:28] ~ Bilel: Mercury are becoming more and more unreliable lately.
[9.08.24, 19:00:51] Matán Intsuper: I’m honestly very happy with them and never had an issue
[9.08.24, 19:01:25] ~ Maxi: Which one are you using.
[9.08.24, 19:01:47] ~ Maxi: I tried open Wise with US LLC but it does not have an USD wallet for whatever reason
[9.08.24, 19:03:24] ~ Bilel: It’s just that they are very regularized now and ask so many questions. They blocked my account for 5 days. Last week. Didn’t have access to funds, statements or anything. Couldn’t even log
[9.08.24, 19:03:43] Matán Intsuper: What was the issue?
[9.08.24, 19:03:51] ~ Bilel: They wanted proof of funds
[9.08.24, 19:04:55] ~ Bilel: With higher volumes there are other options. Can shoot an intro
[9.08.24, 19:05:57] ~ Bilel: They wanted payment processing invoices dating 3 years ago. Don’t even have access to the payment processors anymore
[9.08.24, 19:07:07] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I think it would still have an effect because Meta scans your landing page + domain and it could potentially affect it. I’d probably stop the adset at midnight, change it and then launch it again
[9.08.24, 19:09:11] Matán Intsuper: Sounds annoying
[9.08.24, 20:02:59] ~ Alessandro: Yes I’ve passed that. I’ve just provide them an invoice from an USA client
[9.08.24, 20:03:53] ~ Alessandro: Bro are u using that? It’s a good option?

[9.08.24, 20:07:26] ~ Alessandro: I just provide an invoice from an USA client that pay me
To provide them that I’m working with an USA client 
They asked me that about 6 months ago
[9.08.24, 20:07:36] Matán Intsuper: Shopify client ?
[9.08.24, 20:07:47] Matán Intsuper: Address in Europe and utility bill?
[9.08.24, 20:08:13] ~ Imad: Yes they are very good I use it myself you don’t need an itin or ssn
[9.08.24, 20:08:19] ~ Alessandro: No was guy that make me a bank transfer
[9.08.24, 20:08:41] ~ Alessandro: No, they don’t ask me an address
Just a proof that I’m dealing with an us entity
[9.08.24, 20:11:43] ~ Alessandro: I speak recently with @⁨Marek Olszewski⁩ 
He suggest me this option if you need a physical USA address: https://www.virtualpostmail.com/truresidence/

But honestly I don’t try that
‎[9.08.24, 20:19:46] Matán Intsuper: ‎image omitted
[9.08.24, 20:20:04] Matán Intsuper: Not bad, super expensive though. But you can do for one month get the utility bill and quit
[9.08.24, 20:21:58] ~ Alessandro: Yes it’s expensive

But I don’t know any other option
[9.08.24, 20:22:54] Matán Intsuper: Well it’s definitely the only option and it’s not that bad
[9.08.24, 20:25:08] Matán Intsuper: Also they have option to share the lease with more businesses
[9.08.24, 20:25:11] Matán Intsuper: And share the cost
[9.08.24, 20:31:50] ~ Alessandro: Maybe reach @⁨Marek Olszewski⁩  maybe he know something more

Thanks to him I have that option (but I don’t have try that)
[9.08.24, 22:11:08] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey Guys
[9.08.24, 22:11:25] ~ Wouter Akika: who here runs subscriptions in Europe with SEPA domiciliations / auto-debits
[9.08.24, 22:11:46] ~ Wouter Akika: or knows someone that does?
[9.08.24, 22:14:37] ~ Maxi: Sent you a dm @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩
[10.08.24, 7:19:46] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Hey guys, performance on my ads have been awful these past 2 days, have you experience this? if so what have you done to fix it? duplicate the campaign and run the new one?
[10.08.24, 22:19:54] ~ Alexander Sundström: I am testing my first few advertorials now. I have been running ads for a day and no one has opted in. I used 4 winning creatives. Kill it and go to the next advertorial?

[11.08.24, 14:08:16] ~ Alexander Sundström: How do I get the orders from funnelish to sync with Shopify? I have turned the integration on, but I don’t see the orders in Shopify. How does it work? ‎<This message was edited>

[11.08.24, 14:27:22] ~ Alexander Sundström: Thanks!!!
[11.08.24, 15:43:13] ~ Alexander Sundström: I have it setup now (I think). The orders I got before the automation is not visible in Shopify. Will that sync automatically or do I need to fulfill them manually?
[11.08.24, 16:37:26] ~ Y: Future payments (including subscriptions) will sync, past ones will not
[11.08.24, 16:37:56] ~ Alexander Sundström: Thanks, I will have to fulfill that manually then, right?
[11.08.24, 16:38:54] ~ Y: Yes past orders will gave to

[12.08.24, 15:24:08] Topi: Team, anyone knows payment processor that works with shopify and allows subscriptions? 

First time doing subs so this might be stupid question.

Appriciate any insights ‎<This message was edited>
[12.08.24, 15:25:25] ~ David B: Hey guys. I'm back from the Philippines so copywriting calls will resume from tomorrow at 10am EST.

If you have any copywriting questions, please bring them with you. 

I'll be sharing some of my favorite formulas for short form video ad scripts so you can see how easy they are to put together. 

See you there.
[12.08.24, 16:09:22] ~ Mikael: Anyone who started with a new Shopify store, new Company in a different country to where you are Selling to and applying for google ads? 

We started new store, new Company in HK. applied for Google ads to sell in UK but they missrepresentated us.
[12.08.24, 16:10:09] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Has anyone sold to the EU before while owning a foreign company, such as an UAE company? My fear is that customers will see this when checking out on payment processors, and therefore not want to go ahead with the purchase.
[12.08.24, 20:16:35] Carlos Leeseman: Is anyone looking for a customer service rep? My little brother is currently looking for a part-time customer service job.
[12.08.24, 20:21:05] ~ Wouter Akika: I Recommend Checkout Champ for acquisition brother, Shopify restricts merchants to certain processors when running subs and that grip will only increase until stripe is the only option available & maybe they even merge the companies one day. Their strategic partnership is a probable risk to you as it could leave you without alternatives. ‎<This message was edited>
[12.08.24, 20:34:17] Carlos Leeseman: Does it also work with Stripe on Funnelish? We’re currently building a whole subscription funnel lol
[12.08.24, 20:45:17] ~ Maxi: You can just build the checkout + post purchase on checkout champ and re-direct traffic from funnelish page there
[12.08.24, 20:48:10] ~ Y: subscriptions on Funnelish using Stripe do work just fine, but be careful with Subscriptions on upsells (with/out Stripe) gateways tend to consider them as high risk, I would recommend having a stripe account manager first before risking it.
[12.08.24, 21:08:02] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey! Does what work?
[12.08.24, 21:08:37] ~ Wouter Akika: Yes, we have done that too prior to the full migration, it worked perfectly!
[12.08.24, 21:08:43] Matán Intsuper: What about subscription as main product and then normal upsells ?
[12.08.24, 21:53:43] ~ Ecomcesar: do you guys have a Good CRM suggestion to integrate with funnelish?

[13.08.24, 18:29:18] Matán Intsuper: hey guys, what are the most efficient retargeting ways except facebook ads?
[13.08.24, 18:29:25] Matán Intsuper: for people who sell through funnelish and not through shopify
[13.08.24, 18:29:39] Carlos Leeseman: 100% google
[13.08.24, 18:29:50] Matán Intsuper: @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩ how do you retarget with google? pmax campaign ?
[13.08.24, 18:30:15] Matán Intsuper: display campaigns
[13.08.24, 18:30:16] Matán Intsuper: ?
[13.08.24, 18:31:19] Carlos Leeseman: Yeah and mostly brand search campaign. Definitely when you have competition in your niche
[13.08.24, 18:32:21] Matán Intsuper: i wouldnt consider brand search campaign as retargeting
[13.08.24, 18:40:27] Carlos Leeseman: @⁨~Bony Ghadiya⁩ is doing our ads. He got us profitable on Google within 3 weeks already
[13.08.24, 18:48:45] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Pmax is built in such a way that it would target TOF + MOF + BOF regardless. You can force it to pick either of those at high extent though

For Reteragetting, Pmax and YT would be the best options!

Then Display and Search
[13.08.24, 18:49:50] Matán Intsuper: And what if I have 10 different products ?
[13.08.24, 18:52:05] ~ Bony Ghadiya: same thing; just make sure your feed is dynamic.

That means if someone viewed a page for an iPhone, you retarget the iPhone, not the printer.

If your feed is dynamic, Pmax is smart enough do this
[13.08.24, 18:52:49] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Or you can make categories or diff audience signals with asset groups
[13.08.24, 18:56:22] Matán Intsuper: last question, so if 99% of my traffic is on funnelish, how do i get PMAX to retarget those people, as its only focused on shopify traffic
[13.08.24, 19:36:03] ~ seth: anyone running ads partnership before? I have some question regard the setup, why when i setup the campaign with a via at ads level it keep saying my page "Page X hasn’t given you permission to run partnership ads. Request permission in Meta Business Suite." but i already give the via full access of the page
[13.08.24, 19:39:00] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Checkout.com bro no? @⁨Topi⁩

[13.08.24, 19:40:37] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, how do you mass test creatives on Meta ads? We test a few new creative concepts per week and are ready to ramp that up a lot. But we don't have the room in our spend to give each concept a few hundred bucks to spend if we test 10+ per day. Do you know of any other way to mass test?
[13.08.24, 19:43:47] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey brother, you can use CBOs with a minimum spend / ad set ‎<This message was edited>
[13.08.24, 19:44:47] ~ Wouter Akika: This way fb still spend on everything, so it's like forcing it to search for the right people, but also not spending full budget if it notices that after $X it's clearly going nowhere (fb can tell quite fast)
[13.08.24, 20:18:36] Matán Intsuper: we run each creative in an ad-set with 3 hooks for the same creative. each ad-set $35, and we turn it off if it wasnt profitable after $50 spend
[13.08.24, 20:20:15] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Should I hire someone specifically for optimizing our funnels conversion rates, like adv, sales pages, etc? What is this position called guys?
[13.08.24, 20:27:44] Carlos Leeseman: CRO Specialist
[13.08.24, 20:28:12] Matán Intsuper: its called a cro expert, and we do it ourselves
[13.08.24, 20:29:22] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Ok, so you never hire this position?
[13.08.24, 20:29:49] Matán Intsuper: i prefer to master it myself before hiring
[13.08.24, 20:31:06] Matán Intsuper: and i plan to delegate it to my team
[13.08.24, 20:41:29] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: really smart, i think the same, how do you split test in funnelish brother? Do you have any resources such as youtube videos or anything you can link me to? Or am I being dumb and this is all explained in the ESS course?
[13.08.24, 20:42:09] Matán Intsuper: mm its pretty straighforward, you can duplicate a page in a funnel, and change something, and then do 50-50 for the traffic and see which performs better. https://docs.funnelish.com/advanced-features/a-b-testing
[13.08.24, 20:50:00] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: I honestly just split test main headline and main image, for ADV that is.
[13.08.24, 21:50:33] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Use funnelish links as landing page, setup tracking on funnelish, you can even duplicate feed with funnelish as landing page
[14.08.24, 2:16:37] Matán Intsuper: not enough
[14.08.24, 2:21:13] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: What do you recommend split testing Matan? Besides these two factors, specifically on my advertorials and sales pages?
[14.08.24, 2:33:16] Matán Intsuper: you can split test anything, but you can try comparison tables, social proof, amount of reviews, button color, button text, scarcity, guarantee..
[14.08.24, 2:41:48] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Thank you so much for this.
[14.08.24, 2:56:59] Amit Wadhawan: Hey guys… Stripe put a 35% hold on my transactions until Oct 12. Is there any way to overturn this?
[14.08.24, 8:12:48] ~ Jeb: I have a general e comm question. Does anyone have any experience with acquisition outside of ads? 

Like hiring 100 influencers to make content everyday for a brand or organically posting on TikTok/ IG and hoping to get some viral content etc. 

I see a lot of people on social media  talk about this, Mostly gurus. And I have dabbled in it briefly but I never saw any results.

If you go hard with this, is this a legit acquisition channel? Or is this a fantasy guru’s are selling? Genuinely very curious. If it is legit, does it come close to ads? Is it worth building something like this out, or better to spend your energy on building better ads etc ‎<This message was edited>
[14.08.24, 9:18:42] ~ Mikael: Does anyone know if there are any 3rd party checkouts that work with Airwallex or Oceanpayments?
[14.08.24, 12:05:39] ~ Y: Funnelish works with airwallex
[14.08.24, 12:06:28] ~ Mikael: thats good! what About any 3rd party checkout for Shopify? (i forgot to mention it was shopify i was interested to know About)
[14.08.24, 12:06:47] ~ Y: If you do 5m+ per year and use funnelish we can get you a stripe account manager to help with that
[14.08.24, 12:07:20] Carlos Leeseman: Contact @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩
[14.08.24, 12:07:25] ~ Y: Funnelish can be linked to shopify without having to go through their fees or checkout
[14.08.24, 12:08:09] ~ Mikael: So you mean using funnelish as checkout? when customers purchase Products from our shopify website
[14.08.24, 12:08:58] ~ Jonathan Lindberg: It works but only with credit card I Think not Klarna through Airwallex on Funnelish
[14.08.24, 12:10:16] ~ Y: We have Klarna, iDeal, bancontact on the roadmap
[14.08.24, 12:11:26] ~ Y: Not really, you rebuild the entire checkout and funnel in funnelish then sync orders to shopify… i don’t think shopify allows bypassing their checkout the way you mentioned
[14.08.24, 12:15:32] ~ Mikael: okey, I am looking if its possible to use 3rd party checkout for Shopify so that we can have multicurrency in the checkout while using airwallex
[14.08.24, 12:51:29] ~ RS: Do you run multiple ASC+ campaigns with the same ads in them in one ad account? Or do you put different ads in each ASC?
[14.08.24, 13:08:40] ~ Allan L: Hey boys.
Anyone promoting in netherlands who are doing good iwth upsells? If yes, what app are you using for the upsells?
[14.08.24, 16:05:03] ~ Nils: we have tried this before with 100+ content creators. was a huge waste of time and money
[14.08.24, 16:17:02] ~ Kevin Krieg: Thank you!
[14.08.24, 16:35:01] Radek: Testing the offer had the biggest outcomes for us. You can play with price, testing different offers b2g1, various quantity discounts  etc. Also increasing the value - free shipping, extended guarantee, free gifts, ebooks, courses are the biggest levers. Besides that try to capture FAQs and answer them directly (FAQ) section, or indirectly (by adding new page section addressing the objection). A huge boost is to add real customer video testimonials. Check the biggest DTC brands and get inspiration from their funnel.

[14.08.24, 21:12:34] ~ L: Guys a lot of our ad accounts are getting restricted for “unethical business practices” - 

basically we’re making too exaggerated claims. It doesn’t look like this to me, we tried to soften the message a little bit but still they get disabled.

Any of you have the same issue ?
[14.08.24, 22:10:29] ~ Kamal: How are you doing data analysis? GA or within funnelish? Or do you just change one element and look at cr %

I use clarity, ga, but I want a better dashboard to improve our cro efforts.
[14.08.24, 22:12:22] Matán Intsuper: Funnelish clarity and yes
[15.08.24, 0:45:35] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey Guys!

We are looking to hire 2X Checkout Champ web developers, any good recommendations?
[15.08.24, 0:45:53] ~ Wouter Akika: Front & Back-End skills must be strong
[15.08.24, 1:20:53] ~ Nils: yo im checking! will get back to u once i have a reply
[15.08.24, 1:31:55] ~ Wouter Akika: Thanks brother!💪🏽
[15.08.24, 2:04:09] ~ Chris: Hi guys, anyone based in Melbourne Aus?
[15.08.24, 2:34:07] ~ Bestfulfill—william: We work with a lot of people who buy inventory on monthly bases but the best way is always plan it based on the production time and your selling plan. Don’t buy too much inventory just to lower the product cost. Many cases the inventory can’t be sold out and actually affect your cashflow. But if it’s a brand already. U can try to be more aggressive to buy more inventory
[15.08.24, 2:37:17] ~ Bestfulfill—william: For example production takes 7 days so u can buy 10 days earlier to be safe
[15.08.24, 2:46:06] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: @⁨~Bestfulfill—william⁩ - in a perfect world with products that have short lead times, you are right, but for certain beauty tech devices or custom skincare products, those lead times are 30+ days.  Typically what we do with those products is track the sales with the lead times and figure out the optimal purchasing cycles so that cash flow is freed up and not tied up too much into inventory. @⁨~Jeb⁩ - it depends on your product category and then what your lead times are and how much volume ur selling per day.
[15.08.24, 2:48:31] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Perfect
[15.08.24, 8:28:04] Carlos Leeseman: Who here is working with Checkout Champ? And how difficult is it to switch to this and do you really need a developer for this?
[15.08.24, 11:25:35] ~ seth: very difficult at fist and yes you need dev for it
[15.08.24, 11:57:13] ~ Viktor Metodiev: Does anyone have a great Google Sheet template to track cashflow/inventory that they can share?

Or what do you guys use?
[15.08.24, 16:52:16] ~ Chris: Hey guys anyone recently tested regular Broad CBO vs ASC for scaling? Is ASC working for yous
[15.08.24, 18:06:35] ‪+48 508 310 599‬: hi guys, one of my 300 USD ad sets started good, and now went below BE ROAS. Do you let your similar ad sets do this and keep them for the rest of the day, or do you kill them right when the ROAS goes below BE?
[15.08.24, 18:42:25] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Hey brothers!

Does anyone have a media buyer they know, that is in need of a job? 

YouTube/Google ads only. 

Thank you!
[15.08.24, 21:31:56] ~ Bretten Hadley: Does anyone use The Hartford for business insurance? If so what policies do you coverage for?
[15.08.24, 21:50:31] Carlos Leeseman: Is reach/checkout.com working with Funnelish?
[15.08.24, 21:55:36] Matán Intsuper: Yes we use reach
[15.08.24, 21:56:07] ~ Mike Ramsey: The only limitation is partial refunds which require a manual email to Reach to complete it.  That’s a known limitation however.  In rare instances, orders may not show in Shopify, but again - those are rare.
[15.08.24, 22:47:33] ~ Jeb: Why was in the ess call earlier that wanted to talk about manufacturing themselves?

[16.08.24, 19:27:01] Carlos Leeseman: What is the best method to run advertorials trough Shopify?
[16.08.24, 19:27:33] Carlos Leeseman: Like is it possible with GemPages?
[16.08.24, 19:28:51] ‪+48 508 310 599‬: Checkout Champ
[16.08.24, 19:29:07] ~ Bretten Hadley: Yes they even have advertorial templates you can use 

And then use checkout champ
[16.08.24, 19:32:10] ‪+48 508 310 599‬: With Gempages from my experience they tend to be sluggish. I would personally prefer to do a landing page on shrine theme instead. Or use Checkout Champ Account Manager for a custom page
[16.08.24, 19:33:30] Carlos Leeseman: Okay, but it’s not possible to create a funnel in Shopify?
[16.08.24, 19:36:29] ‪+48 508 310 599‬: depends on the funnel. If it's just a listicle, you could easily do a theme landing page, same for the sales page, and then either direct it to a funnelish checkout page, or even use an app like EG Auto Add To Cart to make offers, and then boom right to shopoify checkout
[16.08.24, 23:20:09] ~ Alessandro: Someone in USA target country? What’s your cpm?
[17.08.24, 2:29:29] ~ Facundo: Hi guys, does someone have any contact of a good photographer in China?
[17.08.24, 2:43:34] ~ Bestfulfill—william: We can do
[17.08.24, 2:47:00] ‪+48 508 310 599‬: Hey William, my wire transfer is taking its time, can you give me you paypal details on skype pls
[17.08.24, 13:23:39] ~ Mikael: Anyone who applied for Google ads with new HK Company + new store?
[17.08.24, 17:57:37] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Pretty sure @⁨~Richie⁩ has one
[17.08.24, 17:58:16] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Does anyone use a certain software to plan out their inventory and make sure they stay in stock while saving on shipping costs? (Air vs Sea)
[17.08.24, 18:51:23] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Fuck it, I made a shitty but functional spreadsheet 😂
[17.08.24, 19:20:43] Carlos Leeseman: Is UK doable without PayPal?
[17.08.24, 19:24:14] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: It’s always better with PayPal, I have around 40% of the UK sales coming from PayPal. But you can still try to test it
[17.08.24, 19:25:15] Carlos Leeseman: Okay that’s pretty good actually. If you don't use PayPal you will push people to CC
[17.08.24, 19:26:54] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Yes, correct
[17.08.24, 20:29:22] Amit Wadhawan: Did you guys have to register to collect taxes/VAT there?
[17.08.24, 21:58:32] ~ Facundo: Any shopify insider to get suspended product back?
[17.08.24, 22:10:50] Matán Intsuper: Why not just duplicate it ?
[17.08.24, 22:17:44] ~ Facundo: For some reason when i duplicate the product i am not allowed to link it to gampages
[17.08.24, 22:18:14] ~ Facundo: Got a dmca yesterday so i guess thats the reason
[17.08.24, 22:19:24] ~ Nils: Anyone have good contact for opening up US LLC as a foreigner? + bank account
[17.08.24, 22:20:50] ~ Omid: If you don’t have to many SKUs delete Meta app from store and reinstall, it will sync shop for you again, you can make other listing a draft ‎<This message was edited>

My question is:

Should I create a product in Shopify that is digital and link it to funnelish? What is the best way to do it?
[19.08.24, 1:09:55] Topi: Yes this works @⁨~Alexander Sundström⁩
[19.08.24, 1:10:07] ~ Alexander Sundström: Is that the best way to do it?

[20.08.24, 19:43:18] ~ Mikael: Anyone who can explain whats going on? Or been in similur situation with META ads.

I test same products on 2 different stores. 1 of them allways gets the ball rollin and gets sales and customers.

But the second store FB say its decent link clicks but the data in shopify only shows 70% less customers. So the sales are very low aswell as customers dont enter website..
[20.08.24, 20:04:56] Matán Intsuper: focus on the store that works well

[20.08.24, 22:15:33] ~ Joshua: Does anybody have good graphic design examples of bundle offers? Like how these are presented on the product page.
‎[21.08.24, 6:17:02] ~ seth: ‎image omitted
[21.08.24, 7:52:57] ~ Mikael: The FB ads are showing way more Link Clicks than what shopify and vitals show. for example. One adset shows 33 Link clicks yesterday, but Shopify 10. What can the issue be?
[21.08.24, 8:03:13] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Have you tried looking at the unique outbound clicks?
[21.08.24, 8:04:04] ~ Mikael: Yeah its also 33, Unique link CTR 3% for this specific campaign
[21.08.24, 8:43:28] Bob: Anyone that has a recommendation on sharing team passwords for softwares? We are looking for a tool that works well where we can give them access to our softwares so they can log in but not get the real password. We have been working with Lastpass, but want to look if other people maybe use other tools that work better.
[21.08.24, 9:05:16] ~ Kim Romanov: Password managers are for keeping real passwords. Check if your software support application passwords or user accounts with specific permissions
[21.08.24, 9:05:47] ~ Kim Romanov: Or add 2-step verification for your accounts to avoid possible using on other devices
[21.08.24, 9:29:59] René Crooijmans: Dashlane works perfect for password sharing, Lastpass has had multiple breaches in the past

Like Kim said, for software applications you can create user accounts and assign them permissions
[21.08.24, 9:33:11] Bob: Perfect, thank you guys! 

Most of them do, but some don’t. It’s also easy in this way to have 1 guest account that has a standard team login and give them access to this one so they still are a guest in the account.
[21.08.24, 9:57:51] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, question. Do you use the dame Facebook page for multiple languages? Or 1 page per language?
[21.08.24, 12:28:52] ~ Tiberio: I think it’s a tracking problem due to users not accepting the cookies. It happens to me with EU users
[21.08.24, 12:35:14] ~ Mikael: Aah maybe!
[21.08.24, 13:41:28] ~ Alexander Sundström: How do you get a video to autoplay on desktop and mobile for one your product page in the product photo section in Shopify?
[21.08.24, 14:31:01] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey all, I will be travelling im the next 2 weeks. Wont habe internet so wont be here for the Creazive Sourcing calls on thursdays. Will announce once back. Talk soon guys!
[21.08.24, 14:48:36] ~ Rick: Maybe try gif file instead. Better for load speeds and overall.

[21.08.24, 18:28:03] ~ Eric R: For a few months now, we are getting hit with sometimes a thousand fraud purchase attempts per day on our funnels. The crazy part is they attempt it across different domains and products of ours that arent even related… We have no idea how to stop it and Funnelish support doesn’t appear to be able to stop it either
[21.08.24, 18:28:14] ~ Eric R: Any insights/help would be greatly appreciated!
[21.08.24, 18:31:25] ~ LA: you can use domain/sever level filtering or

CRM level filtering or 
3rd party apps that stack on to CRMs to filter ‎<This message was edited>

[21.08.24, 18:39:51] ~ LA: domain/server = eg. cloudflare filtering

[22.08.24, 4:10:33] China Bigboss: Hello Yusuf are you doing bulk orders? Or you mean dropshipping
[22.08.24, 4:18:09] ~ YUSUF: We have a warehouse in China where we keep our inventory and ship orders directly to customers in the US. We’ll have a US warehouse soon. For now, I’m just looking for a fast and reliable carrier.
[22.08.24, 4:21:11] China Bigboss: There are many to be honest I guess FedEx could be the fastest one as well Yun bulk line as well if you need any help let me know
[22.08.24, 4:24:18] ~ Bestfulfill—william: hi， we can help on this,
[22.08.24, 8:21:51] ~ YUSUF: Yes, there are a lot. We’ve tried a few, but I’m specifically looking for ones that can ship in less than 10 days from China to the US. I was just curious if anyone had a better answer. Thanks tho.
[22.08.24, 8:22:02] ~ Luka: Wise is asking for a trading address for our US business - says this cannot be virtual or the company registration office shared by others (like Delawareinc).

To non-residents US LLC owners, how did you solve it ?
[22.08.24, 8:30:27] ~ Akshay: You can rent a physical mailbox to receive mail and use that address. I use a service called anytime mailbox, there’s many similar ones.
[22.08.24, 8:33:29] Marek Olszewski: This can be literally any address (your residential address, for example), no need for US address here. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to be able to prove this address (utility bill, etc)
[22.08.24, 8:34:29] ~ Luka: Ah perfect thought it has to be a US address. Cool thanks
[22.08.24, 11:03:26] ~ Malik: Hi guys, do you also have more rejected ads than a few weeks before ? For no reasons ?
[22.08.24, 11:03:45] ~ Malik: Pre Q4 thing as every year ?
[22.08.24, 11:08:50] Marek Olszewski: Q4 + elections in the US, most likely more bans this Q4 than previous years

[22.08.24, 17:53:24] Matán Intsuper: Just put your home address even if it’s international. Don’t use any virtual mailbox. It worked for me and I was confirmed . same with mercury
[22.08.24, 17:53:45] Matán Intsuper: They are not asking to prove the address
[22.08.24, 17:55:50] Marek Olszewski: Initially they don’t, but when some compliance kicks in they might
[22.08.24, 17:56:13] ~ Santiago: Do tey give you a utility bill with this option?
[22.08.24, 18:00:13] Marek Olszewski: Not with a mailbox, utility bill + address is more expensive and usually a different service
[22.08.24, 18:52:36] ‪+46 73 029 89 70‬: Hi everyone! Does anyone know if the 'Video Average Play Time' metric counts from the very first second of the ad, or does it start counting after the hook. 
I've heard that it starts counting after the hook, but I'm not sure. Thanks!
[22.08.24, 19:38:50] ~ Nils: For me it makes more sense that it would be from second 0. I dont see how Facebook could know what a ”hook” is or not.

[23.08.24, 12:42:26] ~ Mikael: Hey, have anyone experienced this same issue. Last 07 day data. Meta show 3x roas and google show 3x roas. But store data show 2.2x roas. We are using wetracked to track this. What might be the issue here?
[23.08.24, 12:43:00] ~ Mikael: (I know there might be transaction fees and other fees etc)
[23.08.24, 13:10:12] ~ Kamal: Wetracked chat support is really good you can ask them they'll look into it
[23.08.24, 13:11:01] ~ Mikael: Yeha okey bro, I asked them before but i did not have concrete data or proof. Ill gather all data I can and talk to them again. Thx
[23.08.24, 13:13:25] ~ Kamal: Hey guys finding some of my VSL's on facebook are slowly getting rejected after months of them running fine.

I re-upload and they get rejected again. Any ideas? 
[23.08.24, 13:16:13] ~ Powa: Have you tried asking for another review? All of my VSLs got rejected, but after asking for another review, they approved it.
[23.08.24, 13:16:42] ~ Maxi: Worst case you can pay the service that re-activates your ads
[23.08.24, 13:16:50] ~ Maxi: They still can get rejected again
[23.08.24, 16:37:48] ‪+41 75 418 01 39‬: if u pay for the service of getting them reapproved and they use to run for a long time they won’t get rejected again with high certainty at least this has been the case for us
[23.08.24, 16:41:01] ~ Kamal: I did twice and it got rejected both times so I think it's best not to keep trying to review I'm worried they ban the ad account
[23.08.24, 17:44:21] ~ Santiago: Hey guys, not the subject of this group, but i got my IG page with 22k followers disabled, does anybody knows a plug to unban it?
[23.08.24, 17:45:11] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: why disabled?
[23.08.24, 17:46:19] ~ Santiago: "Why this happened?

You’re account or activity on it, doesn’t follow our community guidelines on account integrity and authentic identity "
[23.08.24, 17:47:16] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: typical insta BS... sad to hear Santiago, I hope you get it back brother! 💪
[23.08.24, 17:49:03] ~ Santiago: thanks g
[23.08.24, 17:51:07] ~ Jacob: It also can be because we are close to us elections, i had period of time like this in the past when they become super strict

But to be eligible you need to work with stripe for almost 5month
Then you can ask them to review your account and start with instant payouts

[24.08.24, 16:35:48] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hi,

I am unable to make payments with cards and transfers from my Airwallex account. I haven't received any notification in the app or via email. Could someone help with a direct contact?
[24.08.24, 17:54:08] ~ Nils: Hey! Is it needed to use Cookie banner on website? We noticed when we added it, facebook pixel was not able to track unless they clicked on 'yes' for cookies.

Anyone else delt with this problem and solved it?
[24.08.24, 18:03:31] ~ Bilel: Only for visitors from the EU to be compliant with GDPR regulations
[24.08.24, 18:05:23] ~ Nils: Okay, but the pixel won’t be able to track purchases without them accepting?
[24.08.24, 18:07:20] ~ Bilel: Yes, because of EU regulations
[24.08.24, 18:07:47] ~ Bilel: If you want to stay compliant then that’s what needs to happen
[24.08.24, 18:13:11] ~ Nico Neumann: Hey, I use wetracked.io for this. I‘m also selling in EU. It feeds the data back to fb.
[24.08.24, 18:13:56] ~ Bilel: But it’s the same thing you’re still not compliant like that so I don’t see the difference. Can you elaborate?
[24.08.24, 18:16:14] ~ Nico Neumann: Don‘t know how it works exactly. I just know it uses utm parameters to track the purchase.
[24.08.24, 18:17:30] ~ Adonis A: Hey guys what payment processors do you recommend for anyone selling nutra with funnelish in USA (stripe & air wallex  are no go)
[24.08.24, 18:29:53] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Just curious to know why are stripe and airwallex a no go? ‎<This message was edited>
[24.08.24, 18:31:09] ~ Adonis A: Airwallex flat out denied our application and stripe shut our account down saying they can’t support our business. Weirdly enough shop pay is working fine for now but need a solution for funnelish

[24.08.24, 18:53:31] ~ Joshua: So say you have a split test running in intelligems that is between a product page and an advertorial.. Facebook traffic ads are going to the product page and it's being split test between the two.

 if the advertorial out performs, how do you make the transition to the new link in Facebook ads? would you guys just edit the ads? or would you change intelligems to 100% split?
[24.08.24, 20:16:28] Matán Intsuper: How much does airwallex charge for payment processing? Is it better than stripe/checkout.com?
[25.08.24, 9:42:22] ~ Sonu Duhra: I would you just run Intelligems with 100% split, otherwise you lose social proof, for future ads new website link
[25.08.24, 9:51:47] ~ Bilel: The best thing is to create a redirection from Shopify to deploy the advertorial instead of the product page without changing the link in Facebook. To do that you need to first change the current product handle and then create a redirection from the navigation section.
[26.08.24, 7:21:49] ~ Rúben Costa: Hello guys, I use Klarna through Airwallex as a payment method, but I exceeded the dispute limit and, as a result, I can no longer use Klarna. The worst part is that all the company's funds in Airwallex, totaling 95,000 dollars, have been blocked. Does anyone here have a contact or could help us resolve this situation? ‎<This message was edited>
[26.08.24, 8:26:21] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Hey guys, is there anybody else in recurring subscriptions that has experienced over reporting in meta? We are wildy over reporting. Like WILDLY
[26.08.24, 8:38:33] ~ Sonu Duhra: But your warm audience will also be redirected to your advertorial every time not a good idea. You keep those pages separate for each stage @⁨~Joshua⁩ ‎<This message was edited>

[26.08.24, 19:13:19] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Haha good question😂 but it’s less likely than you’d think! I believe from the airport to the city center is around 35 bucks. Alternatively, the 100E bus is very convenient too, drops you off right in the center for only a few dollars.

[27.08.24, 19:13:21] ~ Jacobo Uribe: @⁨~Jacob⁩ @⁨~Michael Abovyan⁩ thanks guys. Was looking into it for someone who has a retail brand who is looking to get online. I assume black hat stuff wouldn’t be the best way to build trust online though right?
‎[27.08.24, 19:22:24] ~ Jacob: ‎audio omitted
[27.08.24, 19:25:07] ~ Michael Abovyan: ads is a much harder way to do marketing for these types of businesses. Things like influencers, TikTok shops could absolutely crush though

[27.08.24, 20:51:43] ~ Michael Abovyan: you can't assign multiple products on gem pages is the problem, so only 1 of the URLs end up working. Any idea on how to solve this?
[27.08.24, 21:06:15] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Create them as landing pages instead of product pages, I have multiple pages per product doing it this way. Alternatively you could also duplicate the product on Shopify
[27.08.24, 21:56:42] ~ Jeb: Hey everyone, random thing I stumbled upon. Offering free fed ex 2-day shipping on orders $185 or more has helped us increase our aov quite a bit ‎<This message was edited>

[28.08.24, 8:53:51] ~ Chris: Hey guys how long did it take to get accepted into the affiliate networks?
[28.08.24, 8:54:10] ~ Luka: I suggest you add the affiliate managers on Skype to get your application processed faster
[28.08.24, 8:54:15] ~ Luka: Skype/Telegram etc whatever they use
[28.08.24, 9:07:38] ~ Chris: oh ok thank bro, Do i gotta say or show anything unique to them to get in ?
[28.08.24, 9:09:10] ~ Luka: Not sure now, I used to do affiliate marketing many years ago. Basically if you don't have a connect, then just add an AM (affiliate manager), tell them you signed up & would like to get started. They may ask questions and you answer. If you have experience that helps a lot. They tend to ask what traffic source you run, how you run etc. They just want to make sure you won't do anything sketchy and the traffic will be good
[28.08.24, 9:09:22] ~ Luka: Your daily ads budget and so forth
[28.08.24, 9:10:07] ~ Luka: For your daily ads budget even if you don't run any AM don't say $20-$50/day... but rather just say $200/day to start with or something similar
[28.08.24, 9:10:24] ~ Allan L: What network?
But as mentioned, find the network on telegram or Skype and add them.
[28.08.24, 9:11:29] ~ Allan L: As Luka say, dont let them know if you are doing super low volume. They Will probably just ignore you in that case, or reject your application.
[28.08.24, 9:12:22] ~ Allan L: However, if you do get in and still do low volume they Will in most cases use you as a tester to their new offers and tell you the High performing ones are capped
[28.08.24, 9:12:51] ~ Chris: oh ok thanks fellas!
[28.08.24, 9:13:02] ~ Chris: i applied for giddyup

Has anyone got ban from backstage permanently and got their account back?
[28.08.24, 15:20:45] ~ L: Guys, if you have two (or more) products in the same store that are only related by the niche (e.g., Health), but not related by the specific problem they’re solving (e.g., one product for back pain, another for knee pain), how do you advertise them?

Two different campaigns for sure, but do you create a custom event to optimize when it comes to the Facebook Pixel?

Or do you just optimize by purchase and let the campaign handle the optimization?
[28.08.24, 15:21:28] ~ lengjoo: can keep same pixel, ads do the targeting
[28.08.24, 19:33:01] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Guys, how do you speed up your shopify store load speeds, when using heavy scripts, apps, and gempages to build your entire store? 

Our score is 26/100 when using page load speed websites.

Any input heavily appreciated!
[28.08.24, 20:22:00] ~ Jacob: Here are over 50 actionable steps you can take to significantly speed up your Shopify store, especially when dealing with heavy scripts, apps, and custom page builders like Gempages:

1. **Optimize Images**: Compress images using tools like TinyIMG or JPEGmini without sacrificing quality. Use WebP format where possible.

2. **Lazy Load Images**: Implement lazy loading so images load only when they're in the viewport.

3. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Utilize a CDN to serve assets from the server closest to the user, reducing load times.

4. **Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML**: Minimize the size of these files by removing unnecessary characters, comments, and spaces.

5. **Reduce HTTP Requests**: Combine multiple CSS and JavaScript files into a single file to decrease the number of requests made by the browser.

6. **Remove Unused CSS and JavaScript**: Delete or comment out any code that is not being used on your site.

7. **Use Critical CSS**: Load only the CSS required for the visible part of the page, deferring other styles until needed.

8. **Limit Third-Party Apps**: Uninstall any unnecessary apps, and make sure to clean up any leftover code after uninstalling.

9. **Optimize Shopify Apps**: Restrict app features to the necessary pages and remove redundant app code.

10. **Reduce the Use of Sliders**: Replace sliders with a single, high-quality hero image to decrease load time.

11. **Replace GIFs with Static Images**: GIFs can be heavy, so opt for static images or CSS animations where possible.

12. **Preload Important Fonts**: Preload the most important fonts to ensure they are available immediately on page load.

13. **Use System Fonts**: Stick to system fonts to avoid the delay caused by loading custom fonts.

14. **Implement Browser Caching**: Enable browser caching to store assets locally on the user’s device.

15. **Minimize Redirects and Fix Broken Links**: Reduce the number of redirects and ensure all links on your site are functional.

16. **Upgrade Your Theme**: Use a theme optimized for performance, with minimal CSS and JavaScript.

17. **Use Google Tag Manager**: Condense tracking codes into a single tag manager to reduce the number of requests.

18. **Optimize Mobile Performance**: Ensure your site is fully responsive and optimized for mobile users.

19. **Avoid Embedded Videos**: Use video embeds instead of directly uploading videos to your site to reduce load times.

20. **Enable AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)**: Implement AMP for faster loading on mobile devices.

21. **Optimize Liquid Code**: Clean up and streamline Liquid code in your theme to avoid unnecessary slowdowns.

22. **Remove Unused Shopify Apps**: Regularly audit and remove any apps that are not actively contributing to your store’s functionality.

23. **Use AJAX for Quick View**: Implement AJAX to load only the necessary product details when a user clicks a quick view, rather than preloading everything.

24. **Disable or Limit Pop-ups**: Reduce the use of pop-ups as they can add to load times.

25. **Preload Key Resources**: Preload the most crucial resources to speed up the rendering process.

26. **Enable Gzip Compression**: Compress files with Gzip to reduce the size of files sent to users.

27. **Reduce Image Dimensions**: Only upload images in the dimensions required for display.

28. **Limit Number of Fonts**: Use a minimal number of font variations and weights to reduce load times.

29. **Server-Side Rendering**: Use server-side rendering (SSR) judiciously, especially for pages that require dynamic content.

30. **Optimize Video Files**: Compress and optimize any videos before embedding them on your site.

31. **Reduce Cookie Size**: Limit the size and number of cookies your site uses, as these can affect performance.

32. **Use Efficient Image Formats**: Convert images to efficient formats like WebP for faster load times.

33. **Audit and Remove Excess Plugins**: Regularly audit installed plugins and remove or replace any that slow down your site.

34. **Optimize CSS Delivery**: Inline critical CSS and load other styles asynchronously.

35. **Defer Non-Critical JavaScript**: Defer loading of JavaScript that isn’t essential for the initial render.

36. **Limit DOM Size**: Keep the number of DOM elements manageable to prevent excessive processing times.

37. **Avoid Third-Party Widgets**: Limit the use of third-party widgets like social media feeds that can slow down your site.

38. **Prioritize Visible Content**: Ensure that the content above the fold is prioritized and loads first.

39. **Use a Fast Hosting Provider**: If possible, choose a hosting provider that offers fast server response times.

40. **Reduce Image Count on Pages**: Limit the number of images on each page to reduce the overall load time.

41. **Enable HTTP/2**: HTTP/2 allows for multiple files to be loaded simultaneously, reducing load times.

42. **Use SVGs for Icons**: Replace icon images with scalable vector graphics (SVGs) for faster loading and scalability.

43. **Reduce the Size of Hero Images**: Optimize the size of hero images or use compressed formats.

44. **Implement Image Sprites**: Combine multiple images into a single sprite to reduce HTTP requests.

45. **Enable Deferred Loading**: Implement deferred loading for scripts and styles that are not needed immediately.

46. **Use Inline SVGs for Critical Icons**: Inline SVGs for crucial icons to reduce the number of requests made by the browser.

47. **Compress Scripts**: Use tools like UglifyJS to compress and optimize JavaScript files.

48. **Monitor Site Performance Regularly**: Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to continuously monitor and improve your site’s speed.

49. **Reduce the Number of Plugins**: Only use necessary plugins to minimize the performance impact on your site.

50. **Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources**: Ensure that no resources block the first paint of your site by deferring them or loading them asynchronously.

By implementing these techniques, you should see a significant improvement in your Shopify store’s load times, enhancing both user experience and conversion rates. Remember that optimizing site speed is an ongoing process, so regular monitoring and updates are essential【11†source】【12†source】【13†source】【14†source】【15†source】.

If someone can help me out, i'd really appreciate it🙏
[29.08.24, 10:11:26] Radek: It’s week before labor day weekend, fb performance before sales events usually drops, so I wouldn’t be so scared.  We use ABO for testing, ASC for scaling, can confirm performance decline compared to last week.
[29.08.24, 11:11:28] ~ Luka: Anyone have a good alternative to Scalify? To easily launch LAAs, create ads, scale, interest targeting etc rather than manually doing it on Meta. We have some authentication issue with Scalify that they're taking forever to fix
[29.08.24, 11:27:41] ~ Chris: Advantage plus never really worked for me, I’ve been doing broad CBO->regular adset structure- 3 ads per adset
[29.08.24, 12:01:16] ~ Wouter Akika: Recommend running a labor day sale & ads (img & gifs)

Very profitable
[29.08.24, 14:16:25] ~ Aashi: Hey, Can anyone share the link to the notion page in the 1st VSL video of Topi (15.1)? The one I have isn't the same.
[29.08.24, 15:41:19] ~ Nils: weird question: if and when you are going to buy diapers, whats the first brand that comes into your mind?
[29.08.24, 15:42:18] ~ David B: In the UK, pampers.
[29.08.24, 15:43:04] ~ David B: But Aldi and Lidl are the GOATS for baby supplies. 😂
[29.08.24, 18:06:57] ~ Michael Abovyan: Anyone have a good app that files all of their taxes? i am in canada and need to file taxes in a couple of US states.
[29.08.24, 18:14:17] ~ Bilel: Taxjar
[29.08.24, 18:30:30] ~ Nils: this is interesting, we had a branding guy come into our company and ask this question, and like 17 out of 20 people wrote down Pampers. Even I, 22 years old with no plans of buying diapers know about the brand and think of them as the authority in the category. I wonder if its just because i have gotten served ad impressions of them for years
[29.08.24, 18:31:41] ~ Luka: Did the branding guy mention why everybody mentioned Pampers? I can't even think of any other brand on top of my head (probably would remember a few if I Googled)
[29.08.24, 18:32:29] ~ Luka: Pampers kept serving ads for many years on TV. So seeing them for a life time must play a very powerful role
[29.08.24, 18:32:30] ~ Nils: No to be honest I don't really think he did. We are gonna have 4 more 4h workshops with him where i think he'll go into more of the actual strategies
[29.08.24, 18:33:02] ~ Nils: yeah agree
[29.08.24, 18:49:57] ~ Michael Abovyan: has terrible reviews, and is paid service. Doesn't shopify have their own way of filing taxes now?
[29.08.24, 19:26:45] ~ David B: With pampers, there's also a psychological link. Most new parents don't have a clue what they're doing so the ask parents, people around them. Pampers was founded in the 1960s I think so the boomer generation grew up in them and then recommended them. Tv played a massive role in advertising before the Internet. 

People were marketed tp passively. You sat on your sofa and you were told what the best products were and what you should buy. Now, people research, look around, rely on reviews etc etc.
[29.08.24, 19:28:06] ~ Nils: impressions over time basically right
[29.08.24, 19:28:35] ~ David B: Yeah. First to market as well.
[29.08.24, 19:28:56] ~ Nils: are you sure they were the first to market
[29.08.24, 19:29:39] ~ David B: Fairly confident that they were first to market with disposable diapers. People had washable cloth ones before. But I'm not an expert in this niche.
[29.08.24, 19:30:11] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Pampers and huggies
‎[29.08.24, 19:31:29] ~ Nils: ‎image omitted
[29.08.24, 19:31:52] ~ Nils: quick google search seems like they were not, but i can be wrong as well of course
[29.08.24, 19:34:44] ~ David B: So second to market.

[29.08.24, 21:23:48] Matán Intsuper: Just arrived in Europe btw. Anyone in Madrid ?
[29.08.24, 21:48:42] ~ Nils: Any non US residents paying 0% business tax with US LLC here? Just got told by a guy that it wasn't possible, im confused now haha
[29.08.24, 21:49:22] ~ Nils: I heard some people are doing Hong kong setup as well.
[30.08.24, 0:38:45] ~ David B: @⁨~Nils⁩ still thinking about that pampers thing... 

Specificity. 

Pampers is 100% baby stuff. They don't do anything else. Johnson and johnson have their sticky little fingers in everything. 

When you think diaper brand you think pampers because all they do is baby stuff. 

Fairy > washing up liquid. 
Vacuum cleaners > Hoover. 

There are a few brands like this. 

Anyways... I can finally sleep now. 😂
[30.08.24, 1:26:28] ~ Nils: i appreciate this haha! to play devils advocate, i have no idea which brands Fairy and Hoover is

I even asked a Colombian friend (24 year olds) and she instantly said Pampers as well, its crazy hah
[30.08.24, 3:07:07] Carlos Leeseman: Is it possible to autoplay a VSL on landing page in Funnelish?
[30.08.24, 3:18:01] ~ Y: Yes you can do that using funnelish native video element or embed your own video using an html block
[30.08.24, 3:18:16] Carlos Leeseman: Awesome
[30.08.24, 3:18:43] Carlos Leeseman: Also possible that people only can see the button after a x amount of seconds/minutes?
[30.08.24, 7:35:21] ~ Adonis A: Anyone here running native ads ? Would appreciate any resources
[30.08.24, 7:45:06] Topi: Some @⁨~Adonis A⁩ - peak 30k/ day spend
[30.08.24, 7:46:04] ~ Adonis A: Nice work man, do you have a solid rep you can recommend
[30.08.24, 8:32:14] Topi: Theres many platforms, just lmk which and I can connect
[30.08.24, 8:32:37] Topi: Taboola / outbrain etc
[30.08.24, 8:37:24] ~ Maxi: @⁨~Adonis A⁩ 

I'd suggest you start out with Taboola just because their compliance is less strict and Outbrain super unpredictable regarding the advertorial they approve.

You definetly don't want to start the native traffic sources with an advertorial that got ripped apart by outbrains compliance team. Unless you already want to micro-cloak etc.

Taboola will let you keep almost 95-99% of persuasive copy and all the good stuff! ‎<This message was edited>

[31.08.24, 1:54:25] ~ Bestfulfill—william: We used them for 1-2 years overall service is bad. Especially if u want use klarna. Their system seems messed up
[31.08.24, 3:10:18] China Bigboss: To be honest they are the second best solution now for online sellers who sell out of Europe and only need CC we very close partners with them let me know if you need any help
[31.08.24, 3:13:01] China Bigboss: Hey bro I pay 70 USD include all
[31.08.24, 3:16:02] ~ Mike Ramsey: How is OP the second best option for cc payment methods within EU?  I’ve seen much stronger options for EU merchants comparatively.

Greatly depends on hq entity of the business and product, but if EU entity and EU sales I wouldn’t put them as number 2.
[31.08.24, 3:19:07] China Bigboss: Out of Europe not in Europe bro
[31.08.24, 16:02:04] ~ Luka: Will reach out to him thanks
[31.08.24, 19:08:15] ~ Michael Hoang: ‎~ Michael Hoang joined using a group link.
[1.09.24, 3:06:11] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Hey man! If I understand your question correctly, the data you feed to your account is correct. You can feed your account with data from Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, simprosys or even custom coding  etc

The data on your Triple Whale dashboard does not report back to Google! But some tracking softwares offer that feature too, like Hyros

Variations of shopping: I assume you are asking for other shopping placements or how to expand the shopping platform! A Short answer would be YouTube (yes you can run shopping ads on YT) and use Pmax to use shopping for retargeting and remarketing to utilize your feed even more.

"How to refresh Google shopping data without affecting the original data?"

A simple solution is to duplicate your product on Shopify, which means you have more than one listing of the same product on GMC. Now, you can use new/duplicated products for your testing purposes. This way, your original feed/product does not get affected, but you can still test new shopping variables like images/titles/ pricing/ offers/ promotions.

Let me know if any questions

[3.09.24, 9:43:29] ~ Allan L: I would agree with you. But Yesterday it had 25 orders and 1 one supposedly accepted cookies?
[3.09.24, 9:43:46] ~ Allan L: And i even believe i disabled coolies as well yesterday
[3.09.24, 9:43:50] ~ Malik: and removed the market from the cookies section
[3.09.24, 9:44:13] ~ Malik: yeah that's a huge difference indeed
[3.09.24, 9:44:18] ~ Malik: For me it worked

[3.09.24, 9:44:43] ~ Allan L: Will give it another a look. Maybe i didnt disabled it fully or something
[3.09.24, 9:44:58] ~ Malik: not as much of a difference but I'd say 40% less orders tracked

[7.09.24, 18:19:52] René Crooijmans: Does anyone have a working way of getting the Facebook post ID that *does not* use:

Any KPIs for how many people actually buy when they hit checkout? 

Setup: Normal shopify style funnel

1. Advertorial
2. Sales page with bundle
3. Checkout (1:1 copy of shopify checkout) 

Recently found out only 20% of people who visit our checkout end up buying.

This number used to be +40% before we switched to checkout camp. ‎<This message was edited>

[12.09.24, 8:26:05] ~ Santiago: DLocal or Mercado Pago, however Chile is heavy turning into COD as well
[12.09.24, 8:52:45] ~ Farhat Godil: Hello everyone,

I hope you're all doing well.

I'm Farhat, and I've been in e-commerce for about 5-6 years now. For the last four years, I've consistently generated 3-4M in revenue annually, but this year has been challenging, and I can't seem to break out of the slump.

I've been testing new products, but nothing seems to work. My focus over the past six years has been on trending or gifting products, but even those niches haven't performed for me this year.

I'm struggling to figure out where I'm going wrong. If anyone here has been in a similar situation, I'd love to know what helped you get through it. What specific steps did you take to overcome the challenges?

Another concern that's constantly on my mind is my age. I'm 41, married with three kids (aged 5, 13, and 16), and I often feel like I'm competing with younger entrepreneurs, which adds to my self-doubt.

I would really appreciate hearing some positive stories from others who have faced a similar situation and come out stronger.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!
[12.09.24, 9:01:55] ~ Bestfulfill—william: trending products are not working much honestly from a supplier point as well, there are some big players though, with extremely low margin and big cashflow, another opportunities or chance i feel might cause fail in the marketing way, people who use VSL or advertorial seems have better results, we work with a lot of gift sellers od Print on demand, but their sales is dropping too, Q4 christmas season should be fine for gifting ones, i would see, marketing content is the main point that makes a different. ‎<This message was edited>
[12.09.24, 9:10:04] ~ Farhat Godil: Thanks for sharing your input I have been at my wits end wondering where am I going wrong 😀
[12.09.24, 9:10:47] ~ Antonio: What countries?
[12.09.24, 9:14:32] ~ Farhat Godil: United States mostly
[12.09.24, 9:15:43] ~ Antonio: In regards to age my best friend is 43 and altough  he is older he always compensated age with different range of skills and sometimes outcompete younger people, so I guess
[12.09.24, 9:17:20] ~ Farhat Godil: I know age doesn’t matter it’s just a self doubt- specially gets worse when things aren’t a going well
[12.09.24, 9:17:50] ~ Antonio: Doubt and anxiety is sometimes good signal that you might need to change something in your system
[12.09.24, 10:37:49] ~ Sonu Duhra: Doubt and failures are signals to change. Age does not matter, I am 41. As long you are willing to learn and adapt. And don't neglect the things you already achieved, like your marriage and your children.
[12.09.24, 10:41:11] ~ Ignasi: Hi Farhat,

Thanks for being so open about your struggles—it really resonates with me. Remember, the e-commerce landscape is always shifting, so it’s okay to find yourself reassessing strategies. Your track record is impressive, and this rough patch doesn’t define your skills or diminish your past successes.

At 41, your wealth of experience actually gives you an edge—it’s your superpower, not a setback! Sometimes, connecting with other entrepreneurs can offer new perspectives and rejuvenate your approach. You’ve got this, and you’re definitely not alone in these feelings.

Hang in there and keep reaching out like this. It’s a sign of strength.

Best, Ignasi

PS: I’m 51!

[12.09.24, 15:28:58] Topi: Whats your gut feeling what it could be?
[12.09.24, 15:34:47] ~ Alessandro Sassi: In my case skipping the cart, and going directly from the offer page to checkout hurt CR. Also I didn't have GPay and Apple pay with Champ. But I don't think these were the only answer
[12.09.24, 15:55:03] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey team! We are back with the Creative Sourcing call today at 9AM EST. Talk in 5 minutes: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87654957947
[12.09.24, 16:52:16] ~ Facundo: thanks, yes I am selling CoD and its doing well but want add card/online payment as well. Mercado pago you need a RUT which is difficult to get if you are not from Chile
[12.09.24, 16:59:35] ~ lengjoo: anyon uses a cookie consent app on funnelish?
[12.09.24, 18:35:20] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hey about creative testing what work the best for you
Test 5 ads per adset with different hook or less (3-4 ads) ?
[12.09.24, 19:19:10] ~ Jacob: Guys how can i get video editors through ess? where is it in skool? or who i need to talk to
[12.09.24, 20:23:08] ~ Mikael: Hey guys. You who use airwallex for payments. Does it work in EU for customers to purchase with their cards?

Or will airwallex show up as international payment and the card issuer will decline the transaction? ‎<This message was edited>
[12.09.24, 20:26:18] Carlos Leeseman: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩
[12.09.24, 20:42:17] ~ Mike Ramsey: EU entity/business <> EU consumer transaction = higher success rate.  UK entity (or any country outside of EU) <> EU consumer transaction, success rates will be lower.  Depends on issuing bank (customer bank) and how they play with Airwallex.  This really goes for any processor.  

Cross border processing will always have lower success rates unless you transact through a merchant of record or set-up entity where client is located and route your processing through that entity.
[12.09.24, 20:46:07] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Guys, any good, reliable resources on native ads? Who should I be learning from? Never done it before so I am 100% new to them, thank you! ‎<This message was edited>
[12.09.24, 21:25:57] ~ Mikael: Hmm.. do you experience big difficulties with taking payments to HK entidy from EU? Or is it just so small that its barely noticable?
[12.09.24, 22:26:03] ~ Mike Ramsey: What do you mean ‘big difficulty?’  

If you are asking if you will have more failed transactions vs. processing EU entity <> EU consumer, then yes it will be more difficult to have higher CVR because your customers will try to check out and then the transaction will fail at a higher rate since you are routing through an HK entity vs. an EU entity for that EU consumer.  Again depends on issuing bank of consumer in EU and payment method selected!

This also depends on the product you are selling, AOV, demographic you are targeting, etc.  

Wallet payments such as PayPal have better authorization rates since it is a closed-loop payment system.  This is more card specific.  But you will pay more in fees for processing + currency fees flipping HKD to Euro for example.

Hope that makes sense.
[12.09.24, 22:26:46] ~ Mukhtar: Hey guys, we’ve been seeing a lot of incorrect customer addresses on Funnelish over the past few months.

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is this a common problem?
[12.09.24, 23:45:47] ~ Haroon: Guys ive got a sale from a shopify store, it shows one add to cart but no sales in statistic even though I got a sale. My shop viewer have drastically increased because foreign visitor I only run ads in Germany. 

What can I do?
[13.09.24, 0:23:38] ~ Kevin Krieg: We do 1 creative concept per adset, 3 variations of the creative, 2 text, 2 headlines. All inside one CBO and see if it gets spend/results.

Swapped over to this strat atound 6 months ago and super happy with it
[13.09.24, 3:00:17] ~ Farhat Godil: is $300 a good price to pay someone to make a funnel on funnelish which replicates the shrine theme + will have add to cart on sales pages and checkout replicated like shopifys?
[13.09.24, 3:05:55] ~ Jacob: 100$ cbo?
[13.09.24, 3:53:16] ~ Chris: not sure for the exact one ur after, but the funnelish team can clone anything for you if ur on their medium plan for free once, then its $150 per funnel after that

[13.09.24, 15:16:28] ~ Mikael: Hello guys. So stripe is asking us for docs like transactions. 
Contracts with supplier?
Orders from supplier with tracking codes?
Previous payment processing?

This is a brand new dyore etc. Does anybody have some samples or whatever on how these documents should look like? Because we have no idea. Thank you
[13.09.24, 15:44:19] ~ Jacob: Talk with @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩
[13.09.24, 15:53:43] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: It’s a routine review to evaluate your business.

They have most likely requested:
- agreement with your supplier (ask your supplier to provide you with an agreement reflecting the relationship between you and them)
- ⁠list of orders with tracking numbers 
- ⁠bank statements (your company)
- ⁠payment processing statement (if you have any other statement from other payment processors, please submit)
- ⁠itemised customer invoice (issued by you - not your supplier) ‎<This message was edited>

[13.09.24, 20:57:07] ~ Jacob: 📈 Gradually Increase Volume:
Start with small transactions ($100-500/day) and slowly increase by 10-20% per week. Avoid any sudden spikes that could trigger fraud alerts.

💳 Diversify Payment Sources:
Make sure different customers are making purchases. Don’t just use your own credit cards—it looks suspicious to Stripe. Spread out payments over time to keep things looking natural.

⚠️ Keep Chargebacks Low:
Try to keep chargebacks under 1%. Respond to any disputes quickly and offer great customer service to avoid complaints.

🌐 Optimize Your Website:
Make sure your site follows Stripe’s guidelines. Have clear product descriptions, refund policies, and contact details. Use 3D Secure to reduce fraud.

🤝 Be Transparent with Stripe:
If Stripe asks for any documents, send them ASAP. Also, if you have any spikes in volume, be proactive and explain why.

[14.09.24, 23:50:43] ~ Lareina: FB shouldn’t be telling you when the competitors add your pixel. Try creating an allow list and block list in FB event managers to protect your pixel. Big chance the competitor dude is messing up with u 🤷‍♀️ Stay safe amigo @⁨~Jeb⁩

It appears scammers are exploiting a vulnerability in Funnelish, allowing them to run mass fraud cc transactions. Spoke to NMI & Cloudflare, they can’t fix the problem unless Funnelish would allow you to block IP’s and allow only traffic that passes through Cloudflare…

[18.09.24, 18:38:13] ~ Eric R: Never had with this prob with Heygen, perhaps its more so whats being said in the script thats causing the issue
[18.09.24, 18:39:03] ~ RS: Yep. I had it many times. Tried uploading again and some times it worked. Its some glitch
[18.09.24, 18:39:24] ~ L: Without changing the actual script?

[18.09.24, 18:47:31] ~ Mikael: No I dont wana get dmca again. I meant. What should I do with the dmca? How should i answer it? Or not even answer it?
[18.09.24, 18:50:01] ~ Imad: You should answer but it will take like one month to get the product page live again.
[18.09.24, 18:51:03] ~ Mikael: The product or product page is not a big issue. Just the dmca itself. I dont wana risk anything ‎<This message was edited>
[18.09.24, 18:52:41] ~ Malik: You can counter it. They'll likely don't do anything as it's an image from Ali - You should get your product page back in 10days
[18.09.24, 18:53:23] ~ Mikael: What if its actually owner of the images and the aliexpress supplier used copyrighted images? Lol
[18.09.24, 18:53:44] ~ Mikael: As its actually only the images that was dmca takedown. Not the actual product page
[19.09.24, 0:29:40] ~ Bestfulfill—william: a lot of people has DMCA issues, the best way is use other platform like shopline where is the policy is less flexible, or just build your own website on woocommerce etc

[19.09.24, 4:02:54] ~ Santi Roa: Interested as well
[19.09.24, 4:05:46] ~ Santi Roa: The real best way is to not copy other's images and fucking do the work. Then you solve all the issues with DMCA and bans
[19.09.24, 4:08:36] ~ Bestfulfill—william: i am sure even some people use their own videos still got reported by competitors
[19.09.24, 4:08:41] ~ Imad: It can get more complicated than that, sometime you will get fake websites that copy all you custom content and sends you DMCA pretending it’s theirs and Shopify will keep taking your product page down
[19.09.24, 4:30:24] ~ Santi Roa: Never happened to me
[19.09.24, 4:49:42] ~ Facundo: thanks bro

Elevar vs Wetracked or Hyros?

For you what is the best?
We just switch to elevar to test and Roas A sudden drop, maybe a coincidence?
[19.09.24, 9:43:41] ~ Antonio: hey guys, do you recommend any service for fb ads positive comments?
[19.09.24, 9:47:21] ~ Luka: When you experience a sudden performance drop in FB for 3 days straight, do you decrease adspend by a lot and then once it improves, be more aggressive with increasing the adspend to its original budget or how do you guys go about it?
[19.09.24, 9:50:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Wetracked works great for me, but didnt try elevar or Hyros
[19.09.24, 13:01:17] ~ Haroon: Guys is it normal when I target Germany that I have a lot of usa visitor like almost 70% in the testing phase won’t it fuck up my algorithm for ads? How to fix?
[19.09.24, 13:47:13] ~ Adam K.: you can have USA reviewers for ads ( thats what I see in Microsoft clarity ) - but from my experience you shouldnt have USA traffic
[19.09.24, 13:50:01] Matán Intsuper: They look who’s first
[19.09.24, 13:59:50] ~ Haroon: I also think it’s only the first day or two.
[19.09.24, 14:14:32] Matán Intsuper: Definitely shouldn’t be 70% of traffic, just few hundreds of bots and that’s it
[19.09.24, 16:19:06] ~ Haroon: I have 50 visitor first day, 30 of them usa, 10 Germany, 10 Sweden?  Normal? 

I didn’t select German language, only German country
[19.09.24, 17:34:00] Matán Intsuper: What about second day
[19.09.24, 18:50:17] ~ Haroon: Let me see and I’ll tell u
[19.09.24, 19:26:28] ~ Haroon: Do you guys spend for testing max 1x CPA to see profitability or is it about 2 days always doesn’t matter CPA hit (10$ budget a day)?
[19.09.24, 19:27:10] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Guys, what is a good retainer for a Youtube ads media buyer?

What about a Google ads media buyer?

We are paying our Meta ads media buyer 2.5k USD monthly retainer, is that too high in your opinion?
[19.09.24, 20:41:50] Alex  Fedotoff: All depends on their experience and results they deliver. Even $10k is fair if they make your life easier and help you produce 20X+ the profit. As you scale the business, it becomes more about the quality of the people and whether they can make their decisions so you buy back your time than how much you are paying them. Good talent usually isn’t very cheap unless you get them early when they are just starting out or just get lucky. 
One way to look at it: Lets say you make $100k a month in profit managing ads by yourself. That’s a baseline. Then you bring in media buyer that helps getting the biz to $200k a month profit. So you just made more money and saved yourself some time to focus on bigger things in business. In that case, that person is def worth paying well to

One of our members here made $1 mil profit last month, his media buyer made $20K+ (with bonus structure put in place) while managing all the ads for many countries he’s selling products in. Was $20k too much to pay for this? I don’t think so 🙂 Overtime you can think about optimization and cutting costs etc but in active growth mode it’s more about attracting the best people possible to help you grow
[19.09.24, 20:42:59] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: So well said, thank you!
[19.09.24, 20:56:14] ~ Nils: Your overall blended ROAS/marketing efficiency ratio dropped?

[20.09.24, 11:06:22] ~ L: Guys, how many of you are running Dynamic/Flex creatives?

We’re going broad with normal post ads because that makes it easier to buy comments and likes.

I’m wondering if you see a difference in performance with Dynamic/Flex ads.
[20.09.24, 11:06:53] ~ Antonio: is the fb ads webinar active now?

[20.09.24, 12:48:40] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Yap. The only issue is the payment time, you only receive it in your bank after 7 days. However, over time, it can be reduced.

You can hold funds there and these remain segregated if the company were to suffer major losses and they are stored in accounts through banks with FDIC insurance.  They do have protections in place,  but if I were to store cash I’d want it elsewhere and only use Wise as a way to move money and convert currency.  

Relay and Mercury are considered online banks and provide FDIC insurance via their banking partners.  A safer bet to keep larger sums of money sitting there in my opinion.
[24.09.24, 3:03:03] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I need to confirm because this company structure is new to me, however, based on my research, I don’t think I have it.
[24.09.24, 3:04:54] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Valuable information, thank you for that.

[24.09.24, 13:00:57] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys, have you seen better performance on FB having a campaign for each country or consolidating them in one campaign (all ads same language)
[24.09.24, 13:08:02] ~ Antonio: If you need help in Romania let me know, I am from here
[24.09.24, 13:21:55] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Depends a bit on which metric you’re looking for. If you’re doing TOP5 in one campaign, you’ll see lower CPMs just because every country is less expensive than the US. Same story for EU countries. But that doesn’t necessarily mean better performance overall. I always separate the countries to get more accurate data for each and I’ve seen better results like this. There were people on the Mastermind event talking about even doing separate campaigns for each state in the US to target them more specifically and get better results.
[24.09.24, 13:28:11] ~ Suraj Singh: Highly recommend slash. FDIC insured and provides good cashback on card spends. Let me know and i can connect you with an account manager.

Compared to Shopify, we have days when conversion drops.

Any similar experience?
[25.09.24, 9:43:39] ~ Y: Have you tried filtering down using utm tags to know where the drop is coming from? Or is it global to all your funnels and ads?

[25.09.24, 13:29:10] ~ RS: From Alibaba its different. If I buy from Alibaba then I need to pay customs tax

[25.09.24, 14:51:03] ~ Haroon: So does that mean when I fullfill with AliExpress for testing products, every customer that I fullfill through that they pay customs? Is that bad or normal?

I received a notice saying mine will be closed by October 10th, but they didn’t mention if I can provide documents for a review. I’m wondering if it’s because I made a bigger transfer than usual today to an ad account agency. Has anyone faced this issue and had Mercury support change their decision about closing the account after sending contracts or explanations? Any advice would be really helpful! Thanks!
[27.09.24, 5:04:19] China Bigboss: Hey brother did you provide invoice for these transactions and did you transfer to which country these what might effect your account you know their main concern is ML to make an exit plan 
1- provide the needed docs
2- get another bank account asap to transfer your funds there 

Wish you pass this
[27.09.24, 7:48:16] ~ Chris Koh: Hey @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩, thanks for sharing! I want to contribute something more to the community.

I have a strong team of developers ready to turn your Figma design into a CRO-focused page.

As at GemPages, I’ve seen many poor designs that hurt conversion rates, which is why I’ve built a dedicated team to support top brands like yours. 

We don’t clone competitor pages, so you’ll need to provide your own design and content ideas.

If you’re looking for:
* Fast landing page development with GemPages
* Funnel setup with post-purchase upsells
* CRO interactions and integrations
* Reliable, done fast. ‎<This message was edited>

I want to sell my brand/store, how do I go about doing this? 

I've heard Flippa works, but any general guide for a first time seller? Never done this kind of transaction before, super scared of being scammed honestly.
[1.10.24, 5:22:35] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: My main questions are:

1. How do I evaluate the value of my store? We are purely dropshipping with a sourcing agent.
2. How do I make sure the value of my store is as high as possible right before I sell (try and sell at high point)
3. What calculations would you even make to accurately, and logically decide, based on data, that your store is in fact worth selling?
[1.10.24, 5:24:03] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Why are you looking to sell, bro? if may i know
[1.10.24, 5:24:57] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: I have hit a market cap (actual cap, not a limiting belief), as I sell to a very small country with only 4 million people that live in it. 

I want to sell it so I can move on to running new stores in other, bigger, more scale-able markets!
[1.10.24, 5:25:24] ~ Mike Ramsey: How long has it been ‘stuck in transit?’

When you say ‘scale a little too quick,’ What volume / % are you conveying?

There have been significant changes to credit and risk underwriting from Stripe and other major players recently so dramatic spikes >50-100% volume MoM will draw internal reviews in most cases. ‎<This message was edited>
[1.10.24, 5:26:33] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: Like I am sure I can continue to run my current brand/store for another 2-3 years probably, but why bother if the cap is always present.

[2.10.24, 11:37:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thats big, but most important thing to look at is FCP (First contentful paint), i would say if that one is above 2 seconds, there is some optimisation that needs to be done
[2.10.24, 11:44:14] ~ Alexander Sundström: it is almost 3 :D
[2.10.24, 12:33:22] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I would definitely recommend an optimisation. I can send you the contact of the guy who does it for me, he’s top-notch and can get mobile above 90
[2.10.24, 15:04:35] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey brand builders! If anyone is looking for a rockstar assistant with great project management and problem solving skills please dm me for the info

[2.10.24, 19:22:52] ~ Mike Ramsey: Hey All - on today's payments call, I wanted to address a lot of the common concerns I am seeing with many of you around reserves / holds as this is impacting seasoned sellers as well. 

Most of these issues are around reserve requirements and holds as you scale and also how these ratios are calculated. 

I will provide a specific breakdown on how payment processors calculate reserves and the rationales as to why they are doing this.  While Stripe is taking a much more aggressive approach as of late, these reserve calculations are relatively universal and can help you budget your cashflow heading into Q4.  Remember, always take a proactive approach to your business and get a back-up processor (or two) in place for the holiday season.  Relying on just 1 provider anymore is not a smart move so plan accordingly!
[2.10.24, 21:32:09] ~ Alexander Sundström: hey! We got a page "non recommendable" and it says the page is not allowed to advertise. We have been running the same ads for 10 months on a really low budget and the page score has been 2.4 for a while. On the BM it says no issues to be resolved and ads are still running with good cpc. Is this a bug?
[2.10.24, 21:33:16] ~ Malik: If I'm not mistaken, you have 2 scores on a page, one you can see (the actual page score) and the one where it says recommandable or not
[2.10.24, 21:33:45] ~ Malik: and the second, it is when people go to the page and do themselves the review. Not with a notification from FB like the first page score
[2.10.24, 21:33:55] ~ Malik: If I remember correctly
[2.10.24, 21:34:03] ~ Alexander Sundström: oh ,really? I have never seen that
[2.10.24, 21:35:34] ~ Alexander Sundström: We have no e-mail from Meta about any issues. I know that they update the page score every wednesday.
[2.10.24, 21:35:40] ‪+47 973 16 810‬: You can disable that though, no? The page review feature for your customers.
[2.10.24, 21:35:45] ~ Malik: yes you can disable
[2.10.24, 21:36:03] ~ Malik: they won't say anything
[2.10.24, 21:39:37] ~ Alexander Sundström: oh okay
[2.10.24, 22:02:04] ~ Doug Crowe: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ Doug Crowe
[2.10.24, 21:45:38] ~ Alexander Sundström: I checked and the reviews has been disabled since last year.
[2.10.24, 21:45:42] ~ Farhat Godil: I see same for one of my page - but my ads are still on and I am able to create new ads for the page too
[2.10.24, 21:46:26] ~ Alexander Sundström: maybe it is a bug
[2.10.24, 21:46:39] ~ Alexander Sundström: i dont like it, but let's hope :)
[2.10.24, 21:56:04] ~ Alexander Sundström: i checked, there is a lot of other people having the same "issue"
[2.10.24, 21:57:14] ~ Farhat Godil: Ok so hopefully a bug keeping fingers crossed
[2.10.24, 21:57:33] Alex  Fedotoff: It’s finally done! I created a free Whatsapp group called “Dark Lord Ecom Secrets” specifically for high level entrepreneurs just to share the most valuable shit I have on advertorials, VSLs, team building, scaling to 100k/day, 7 figs/mo, etc. If you want in, just fill out the typeform on this page below.

[3.10.24, 8:03:46] ~ Luka: We were using Convert and switched back to VWO few days ago. Much better editor and less buggy.
[3.10.24, 12:42:34] Carlos Leeseman: Have you guys seen big performance dip on Facebook since yesterday? Our CVR went from 2% to 1%
[3.10.24, 12:43:43] ~ Ignasi: A+ suffered. CBOs OK
[3.10.24, 12:44:29] Carlos Leeseman: Same
[3.10.24, 12:45:04] ~ RS: Both CBO’s and asc went down
[3.10.24, 12:45:08] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Performance was horrible yesterday for me, today showing signs of improvement ‎<This message was edited>
[3.10.24, 12:46:31] ~ Olli: CVR doubled today probably fluctuation but 100 less sessions so definitely a sharp increase in CPC
[3.10.24, 12:47:09] ~ Olli: Or CPM
[3.10.24, 12:47:18] Carlos Leeseman: Okay, it seems more people have the problem haha

[3.10.24, 19:20:35] ~ Jacob: Hey guys I have some issue with funnelish integrations.

[4.10.24, 19:11:07] ~ L: Guys, do you notice differences in performance between launching regular ads and Flex/dynamic ads when running a broad CBO campaign without cost caps or bid caps?
[4.10.24, 19:16:48] ~ RS: Flexads never worked for me. More expensive CPC and cpa much higher
[4.10.24, 21:31:47] Jordi: Hello everyone,

What is the best way to get past the shopify verification when being a foreigner and owning an LLC in the US? I don't mind doing anything shady if necessary! You can DM me if u prefer to keep it private 😉
[4.10.24, 21:33:53] Jordi: They emailed me this

To be eligible for Shopify Payments, you must meet one of the following criteria:

If you are a Sole Proprietor, the business owner must personally live in the country.
If you are a Company, LLC, or similar business type, you must be registered with the government of that country, and also be able to provide evidence of substantial operations physically happening there. ‎<This message was edited>
[4.10.24, 21:34:18] ~ Jamie Melia: For me a 3PL warehouse contract was enough here
[4.10.24, 21:34:50] ~ Rick: Then open a llc registered agent like Nevada corporate headquarters it’s a llc holder and acts like you live there.
[4.10.24, 21:35:33] Jordi: Ohh interesting! Can u share more info about that?

[6.10.24, 3:46:02] ~ Caesar: Hi guys!

I am A/B testing my advertorials, but:

How long of a timeframe do I need to let it test in order to be able to judge, real, accurate data, and then make a decision based on that?

And how many tests should be running at once? 

Only a 50/50 split per funnel?

[7.10.24, 15:29:37] Bob: Hey, does anyone know about a app that can display offers on Shopify? Like if you buy x you get y for free on the product page itself. 

I’ve mainly been able to find those that say get like 20% off if you buy 2 and buy 3 for 30% off.
[7.10.24, 17:53:45] Topi: Team, whats everyones pick for quiz app? Is octane good?
[7.10.24, 18:43:33] ~ Jeb: Does anyone have a reliable fb ad account supplier where you can buy quality new accounts from?
[7.10.24, 20:40:08] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Does anyone know how airwallex works with shopify? Selling in netherlands & belgium, only have Ideal & bancontact on in third party payment provider. But if i select it in shopify checkout it sends me to screen from airwallex with all payment methods (cc, klarna, ideal, bancontact etc)

[8.10.24, 3:03:23] ~ Austin: How much do you guys pay a Funnelish creator for a checkout page or simple VSL pre lander page ?
[8.10.24, 3:05:08] ~ Farhat Godil: @⁨~Austin⁩

I wasn’t aware of this but learned it from this group

not sure for the exact one ur after, but the funnelish team can clone anything for you if ur on their medium plan for free once, then its $150 per funnel after that ‎<This message was edited>
[8.10.24, 3:05:50] ~ L: Guys, when starting a new brand (with a new pixel and new ad account), would you start by testing interests (up to a threshold of purchases), or would you go with a CBO broad approach, using 1 ad set per angle to see which one Facebook spends the most on?
[8.10.24, 3:20:24] ~ Austin: I learned about the Funnelish team as well and am using them to clone, but need new funnel and revisions made regularly. Do you have a specified price you pay your Funnelish guy for each page Ex: Lander, Checkout ect.. or is there another way you pay him?
[8.10.24, 3:21:03] ~ Austin: Also how much do you pay a copy writer for an ad script ?
[8.10.24, 4:58:03] ~ Akshay: @⁨~Austin⁩ You can hire from onlinejobs.ph and offer around $5/hour to start for a funnel editor. Copy for advertorials/VSL's you're better off writing yourself/ copying a competitors as finding a good copywriter can be difficult/expensive
[8.10.24, 5:15:55] ~ Olli: Does anyone have any Australian 3PLs they can recommend
[8.10.24, 5:16:09] ~ Olli: And what’s a standard price rate for 3PL if anyone knows
[8.10.24, 5:54:01] ~ Anesh Pillai: Copywriting rate can vary a lot based on talent and experience, ideally you want someone with direct response marketing experience.
[8.10.24, 12:11:04] ~ seth: Hi, anyone running traffic to Shopify with Gempage landing page? My cpc and cost per landing page view is huge different one is $0.6 and the other is $20. Can anyone give me some advice?
[8.10.24, 12:11:54] ~ seth: I think its because the tracking is some how bad because i also using funnelish and checkout champ but don't see the same issue
[8.10.24, 12:20:34] Carlos Leeseman: Does anyone have a example of a UGC brief for VSLs? We have a VSL that needs to be recorded by multiple creators

[8.10.24, 19:12:03] ~ Rick: @⁨~Austin⁩ I dm’d you a guy.
[8.10.24, 20:07:06] ~ L: Has anyone noticed if saying something like ‘X out of 10 doctors recommend this product’ or ‘This product is doctor-recommended’ affects ad approval?

I’m going crazy trying to understand what triggers the review process to reject the ads we’re launching
[8.10.24, 20:08:08] ~ Farhat Godil: Fb is currently on rejectiong spree - rejecting my ads not even remotely related to health or beauty or doctors - just regular gift items
[8.10.24, 22:40:13] ~ Mike Kasdorf: We are for one sales channel. What do you want to know?
[8.10.24, 22:43:08] ~ Anesh Pillai: Hey guys, Any suggestion where to buy Funnelish Advertorial Templates ?
[8.10.24, 23:51:34] ~ Akshay: Hi, does anyone here have screenshots or access to the nooro funnelish template after checkout? The upsell/downsell/thank you pages?
Is there a way to get these without actually having to buy the product?
[8.10.24, 23:53:38] ~ Bruno Oliveira: So i started using my LLC setup and I made 1300$ in the first day with stripe and they blocked me. 🤦🏻‍♂️ now im trying to get other solution for payment processor.
[8.10.24, 23:56:43] ~ Anesh Pillai: I might be able to clone one for you. Pm me
[9.10.24, 0:28:00] ~ Austin: I’ve found most the developers already have them saved, but many times the coaches have sent them to me
[9.10.24, 0:33:21] ~ Anesh Pillai: nice.. I found some.. Definitely open to see if there is a template that works for my niches - gadgets

[9.10.24, 9:54:26] China Bigboss: Hello do you have any specific formula and should it be in the USA or are you open to source it from China ?
[9.10.24, 12:06:38] Marek Olszewski: Hey guys, anyone selling courses/masterclasses here? We’re launching a video course. What’s the best platform to host it that prevents downloads and has auto account setup (would be perfect if it could connect to shopify and use the initial order email)? Thanks in advance 🙏
[9.10.24, 12:11:08] Jordi: What about skool?
[9.10.24, 12:20:50] Marek Olszewski: not sure if this would be easy enough to navigate for older demo
[9.10.24, 12:53:25] ~ Nim: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[9.10.24, 13:05:16] ~ Santi Roa: We use an app called Tevello courses. 
Not sure if they protect downloads, but it's decent to test and MVP and easy to create modules and stuff there
[9.10.24, 13:06:00] ~ Santi Roa: For download protection, all courses get copied at some point anyways. Recording screen, using some weird script, etc. It's inevitable
[9.10.24, 13:06:10] ~ Santi Roa: So I wouldn't worry much about it
[9.10.24, 13:21:14] Marek Olszewski: Thanks Nim, will check it out! Have you used it? 🙏
[9.10.24, 13:22:32] Marek Olszewski: Great stuff, thanks Santi!
[9.10.24, 13:23:14] Marek Olszewski: True, just rather make it a bit harder to copy
[9.10.24, 13:24:47] ~ Santi Roa: Yeah, otherwise just spend that energy looking for copycats once every few weeks and that’s it
[9.10.24, 13:28:44] Marek Olszewski: good point, what’s your strategy with the courses, part of the offer or upsell?
[9.10.24, 13:43:54] ~ Nim: Not yet, but liking @⁨~Santi Roa⁩ recommendation. Will look into that one also
[9.10.24, 13:58:17] ~ Jacob: Today in the courses world, its not about content anymore, its about the community and the support, content is constantly changing and thats not what will give u the edge. What will give u edge is the results of your students that will be achieved through support (lives , etc..) and strong community, and thats much harder to copy
[9.10.24, 14:02:40] ~ Olli: Hey guys, I’m new to ESS but got a question. I’ve got a lot of skeptical customers thinking I’m a scam despite me doing 250 orders and having almost no issues. They are using websites like scam advisor .com to test my website but it’s coming up with a bitcoin scam attached to the same url. 

Anyone have any advice on how to appear “less scammy” or any experience in this?
[9.10.24, 15:06:59] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Are you willing to share the URL?
[9.10.24, 15:13:44] ~ Olli: ‎This message was deleted.
[9.10.24, 15:16:27] ~ Nils: Remove your discount wheel @⁨~Olli⁩ :)
[9.10.24, 15:19:52] ~ Olli: Why is that?
[9.10.24, 15:26:20] ~ Nils: You wrote above that a lot of your customers think that your website is looking scammy, therefore I would recommend you remove your discount wheel, because a lot of dropshipping sites where using these types of apps in the past. And in many cases these dropshipping stores didn't provide great customer experiences which creates a negative association between apps like these and the sites who use them. Therefore, lower trust.
[9.10.24, 15:26:44] ~ Olli: That makes sense. I’ll stick to regular 5% discount pop up 🙌
[9.10.24, 17:30:09] ~ AMZ with System: Hey everyone, does anyone one, if it is possible to connect two different Shopify stores within the same Funnelish account?
‎[9.10.24, 17:31:34] Jordi: ‎image omitted
[9.10.24, 17:31:44] Jordi: 🔝
[9.10.24, 17:32:37] ~ AMZ with System: Thanks 😊. ChatGPT 😂 nice
[9.10.24, 17:38:14] Jordi: My best friend for common knowledge
[9.10.24, 17:38:20] ~ Tarlan: @⁨~AMZ with System⁩ Last time i asked, you could only connect 1 shopify store to 1 funnelish account. 

I had to open other funnelish accounts. 

I would contact Funnelish directly to see if they changed it
[9.10.24, 17:51:17] ~ AMZ with System: Thanks. Will do. Not been able to connect a second one yet
[9.10.24, 18:11:59] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey guys, we are noticing a 35% drop-off between

•⁠  ⁠Facebook Unique link clicks (all) > CoC Visits
•⁠  ⁠Youtube Clicks > CoC Visits

Historically these lined up with a variance of under 5%

Now, we are seeing a 30-45% variance between clicks on the platform & website visits, causing a significant revenue loss.


This started on october 4th & resulted in an equal decline of ad > funnel ROAS.

Does anyone here have experience with Checkout Champ not loading pages for visitors / a similar problem?
[9.10.24, 18:29:52] ~ Richard: I noticed your post and reached out to the CEO and founder of CheckoutChamp since he's a personal friend and I'm a CC customer; Matt Martorano. He asked you to contact him immediately to help resolve your problem; matt.m@checkoutchamp.com

[9.10.24, 20:23:25] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey guys! If you attended last week's payments call, you learned about the correct entity setup process. 

Today, we'll delve deeper into KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) 🔍

These processes verify the identity of your business, helping to prevent fraud and maintain compliance. We'll discuss why they're crucial for a successful setup to prevent account restrictions.

See you on today’s call! 💰🚀

[10.10.24, 16:03:26] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We were reporting large variations in performance and couldn't make sense of them.


Only on Funnelish, not Shopify

And we found that on the days when it dropped, the % of failed payment successes dropped enormously.
[10.10.24, 16:10:43] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Seem like in Europe stripe have some problem
[10.10.24, 16:11:19] ~ RS: Do you Also see many failed payments in your stripe acc?
[10.10.24, 16:13:02] ~ RS: In my older store, where my Aov was over 100$, failed payments were around 10-15% of revenue. Sometimes even more. For example, if you hit 10k store revenue (PayPal+stripe), then 1k-1.5k value is failed payments in stripe
[10.10.24, 16:14:08] ~ RS: For New store where Aov es 80-90$, card approval rate is higher. Not so many declines. P.S I have European stripe and sell to Big4. And declined mostly come only from us payments
[10.10.24, 16:20:08] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Yes
[10.10.24, 16:20:33] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: What did you do for it?
[10.10.24, 16:58:41] ~ Bony Ghadiya: https://login.zenbusiness.com/ , stripe atlas
[10.10.24, 16:59:35] ~ RS: Nothing. Dont know why its lower
[10.10.24, 17:08:34] ~ Jacob: Hi man, yeah i have a lot of deal rejected, now im creating automation, you can create automation in funnelish to be sent email or whatever you want to all the people rejected
[10.10.24, 17:09:05] ~ Jacob: the best in my opinion is just to have few payment procesors, so when you try to recover the rejection you just sent them to another payment processor
[10.10.24, 17:09:38] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: Hmm got it
[10.10.24, 17:10:14] ~ Jacob: yeah its makes me angry to see those rejections hehe
[10.10.24, 17:10:20] ~ Jacob: i must find ways to reduce it
[10.10.24, 17:11:32] ~ Jacob: i think something next level even will be to have an ai agent that will talk automatically with people who got rejected and try to solve it

[10.10.24, 18:06:09] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: 10-15%

[10.10.24, 20:30:47] Jordi: U mean like klavyio?
[10.10.24, 20:31:20] Suyi: No I mean like someone who will actually send out emails for me

[10.10.24, 20:56:12] ~ Joran: Last 2 days have been usually high for me too
[10.10.24, 21:04:58] ~ Joran: unusually*
[10.10.24, 22:00:51] ~ Gordon: Also interested if anyone has recommendations for a good email marketer please
[11.10.24, 6:11:22] ~ Caesar: Guys how do you price test in funnelish? A/B test the checkout?
[11.10.24, 6:52:23] ~ Tarlan: @⁨~Matteo Pellegrini⁩ I have the same issue. 

I have automation for abandoned checkouts. It has 3 different flows and besides “product benefits” etc., in all of them I have a note saying “in case of payment failure, to call their bank to approve the purchase or to use an other card”. 

Recently noticed more failed transactions and decided to add similar note near “complete purchase” button.

That small paragraph helped to recover more failed purchases than that 3 automated emails. 

You can A/B test and see if it will work for you too. 

I’ve been told from Funnelish Customer Service that, that kind of Paypal failure rate is normal.  Because most of the time customers just drop off on some step or change their mind. Probably best way would be to have “Paypal Express checkout” button coded in the checkout page.
[11.10.24, 7:08:28] ~ Jacob: And how much did u recover?
[11.10.24, 7:19:51] ~ Tarlan: i dont have exact percentage difference for recovery rate, but I can see usually customers keep using same card and drop off and never purchase. 

Vs now, I see most of the failed payments, are using different card or pay with same card couple minutes later.
[11.10.24, 7:27:29] ~ Olli: I have a very high atc and low conversion this week but also overall. I have flows setup, a slide cart and no obvious hurdles. Any reason why this might be?
[11.10.24, 15:57:16] ~ AMZ with System: Does anyone use Nitropack with Shopify? Haven’t issues implementing it.
[11.10.24, 15:57:59] ~ Kamal: Anyone tried lightfunnels?

We use funnelish rn but it looks interesting
[11.10.24, 16:17:37] China Bigboss: Yes brother they are growing fast now

What message did you have put?
[12.10.24, 23:12:17] ~ Anesh Pillai: Hey guys . Can anyone recommend a contractor who can  customize a funnelish template for us ?
[13.10.24, 17:18:54] ~ Iskander Zrouga: hey guys, how do u deal with high CPMs initially when testing a new product on a new ad account?
[13.10.24, 17:19:07] ~ Christopher Murphy: I second this question ^^
[13.10.24, 17:31:16] Jordi: Try to make ur ads more engaging 😅
[13.10.24, 18:06:22] ~ Alejandro H.: Heys guys, any tip on how to deal with a competitor that is offering 24 hours shipping but he is actually shipping from China and the delivery takes 10-15 days. He is also lying about the quality of the product and offers a free gift on the order that is never shipped
[13.10.24, 18:08:25] Jordi: I mean... just wait, he won't survive long.
[13.10.24, 18:09:46] ~ Joran: Does someone have a naturally sounding woman for a dutch ai voice on Elevenlabs? (Not flemmish accent)
[13.10.24, 18:40:27] ~ Wouter Akika: Het vlaams accent is het beste 🦁

[13.10.24, 20:54:36] ~ RS: Has anyone asked Stripe to reduce the 25% hold to 10%, or to remove it entirely, if their all-time dispute rate is around 1.4%? And did Stripe actually reduce or remove it?
[13.10.24, 21:16:29] ~ Joran: I do actually, maybe i'll steal one of their voices ‎<This message was edited>

[14.10.24, 12:54:42] China Bigboss: Invideo.io
[14.10.24, 13:02:37] ~ Vasile: Hey guys, unfortunately I need to cancel today's Google call due to a personal emergency. Please feel free to DM me if you have any questions. I apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.
[14.10.24, 14:51:55] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Do you guys use A/B testing tool inside ads manager? Or just create 2 separate ads and let them compete?
[14.10.24, 16:41:11] Alex  Fedotoff: This is pretty high dispute rate. With stripe ideally you want to be ideally under 0.5% dispute rate in my experience
[14.10.24, 17:47:31] ~ Austin: I find good developers on onlinejobs.ph
[15.10.24, 1:26:31] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey guys, can you recommend a reliable physical US bank for Ecom. I’m currently in California but I don’t have SSN or ITIN (still waiting for my ITIN). I’m currently using Mercury but also want to have an account in the case if Mercury will limit my accounts for some reason
[15.10.24, 1:31:14] China Bigboss: Hey bro try Airwallex
[15.10.24, 1:31:19] China Bigboss: USA one
[15.10.24, 1:32:28] ~ Kim Romanov: Thanks
[15.10.24, 1:33:00] ~ Bruno Oliveira: You can use payoneer
[15.10.24, 1:34:40] ~ Kim Romanov: I want a “physical” bank. I’m pretty happy with Mercury so not sure that Payoneer will be a better solution
[15.10.24, 1:37:34] ~ Mike Ramsey: Need an ITIN for ‘physical bank’ or signer in US (non owner authorized signer) with ITIN or Social Security Number

Airwallex probably your best bet until you get ITIN
[15.10.24, 3:44:45] ~ Farhat Godil: What do you guys use to sent an abandoned cart emails in funnelish? Or just use funnelish automation feature?
[15.10.24, 3:47:28] Matán Intsuper: Klaviyo
[15.10.24, 3:47:33] ~ Caesar: Just klaviyo ^^

Checked out CartDNA, but their pricing seems a bit expensive.

[16.10.24, 11:25:03] ~ Adam K.: Hi guys - what app do you use to create bundles for shopify + present it in "general offer choice" product section. My goal is to create offer:
Product A + Product B
Product A + Product B + Product C

I can do that with widebundle ,  but is there an app that adds to cart 3 different products with discount already applied ?
[16.10.24, 12:00:29] ~ Joran: Has anyone got a listicle template from javvycoffee?

[16.10.24, 14:57:40] ~ Adam K.: Thanks @⁨~RakanGammoh⁩ , tried in a past - dont remember if it solves my problem ( i think it doesnt have option to make such bundle ) , rather bundle pack which you display below /somewhere on the product page.

[16.10.24, 15:02:19] ~ Malik: You need a dev and custom code
[16.10.24, 15:02:27] ~ Malik: That's what I did
[16.10.24, 15:02:29] ~ Malik: Hired someone
[16.10.24, 15:05:39] ~ RakanGammoh: To be honest, I tried it, and it worked for me to create bundles as you mentioned before. I did get some help from their support team, though. I think you should give it a try. I'm not sure if you can customize its appearance, but in terms of functionality, it works well. However, if you need something more customized, I’d recommend going with a developer to custom code it instead of using apps. It might be a bit costly, but it’s a one-time thing and won’t affect your website’s speed. Hope this helps, and best of luck!
[16.10.24, 15:10:16] ~ Adam K.: thank you guys - I can build a solution with custom code but it goes auto to checkout ( dont know if its possible to custom code and ATC + show sliding checkout ) - probably need to ask dev :)
[16.10.24, 15:11:54] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I’m pretty sure this in particular comes with an app. I’ve seen this same layout on other pages. I can try to look it up for you

Strange thing is, i am very very profitable even with just 11%, but i can't help but wonder if the adv is actually damaging the whole sales process, resulting in actually less profit then i would be making without it even present... ‎<This message was edited>

[16.10.24, 22:47:20] ~ Jacob: Topy give a good tip in today call, u even can go over sucesful youtube videos in ur niche and take the begining of it to test the advetorial
[16.10.24, 22:47:43] ~ Jacob: Because if they success its means people intrested in that
[16.10.24, 22:47:44] ~ Tarlan: For me good CTR is 40-50%. 

Sometimes same funnel with 40-50% CTR have 15-25% CTR in different market. 

Then I test different headlines, and picture. Until I hit at least 35% CTR.  

And I try to optimize all of my landing pages to max speed. 

I tested having Sticky CTA action button once I introduce the product in advertorial, vs on top of the page, and every time showing sticky CTA on top worked better for me in every market. 

Slightly lower CVR in the checkout but since more people going through the pages, funnel converts more.
‎[16.10.24, 22:49:10] ~ Jacob: ‎audio omitted
[16.10.24, 22:49:26] ~ Caesar: so if the point is to have as many people reach checkout as possible, why not send traffic directly to your checkouts?
[16.10.24, 22:49:53] ~ Jacob: Because no one will be convinced
[16.10.24, 22:50:01] ~ Jacob: Its all about influence
[16.10.24, 22:50:03] ~ Farhat Godil: Got it thanks
[16.10.24, 22:55:13] ~ Tarlan: when I had lower CTR % from Advertorial to product page, I tested sending traffic directly to product page. Even with lower CTR% Advertorial page worked better for me every time. 

Might be different for you though, probably would be best test and compare the results
[16.10.24, 22:55:36] ~ Caesar: Exactly, will do this, thanks Tarlan!
[16.10.24, 22:57:27] ~ Tarlan: you welcome, good luck!
[16.10.24, 23:38:52] ~ Mason: With a 40-50% CTR on advertorial to sales page, what is your sales page to checkout CTR?!

I’m curious because my funnel goes like this:
Advertorial to PDP (19%)
PDP to checkout (35%)
Checkout to purchase (41%)

Would you say advertorial to PDP is my biggest bottleneck?

2.67% CVR month to date
[16.10.24, 23:39:20] ~ Mason: 40% is crazy bro, lots to learn for me
[16.10.24, 23:43:11] ~ RS: If I run video ads, my CTR form adv to sales page is always 40-60%. With picture ads for the same advertorial its 25-35%
[16.10.24, 23:43:46] ~ RS: Your adv CTR depends on what type of ads you run. VSL ads usually have high CTR in lander
[16.10.24, 23:44:28] ~ Mason: That makes a ton of sense, my top performing creative rn is a static image. Need to test more videos
[16.10.24, 23:44:59] ~ RS: Yep with images you will not have so high advetotiral ctrs especially if its long form advetotial
[16.10.24, 23:45:54] ~ Mason: Have you found it’s mainly VSL video ads that contribute to higher adv CTR or UGC focused ads as well?
[16.10.24, 23:46:41] ~ RS: Dont know bro. Havent tested regular UGCs
[16.10.24, 23:46:59] ~ Joran: this is really interesting actually
[16.10.24, 23:47:26] ~ Mason: Got it. Thanks for the tips man!
[17.10.24, 0:17:54] ~ Anesh Pillai: Hey guys, what is the best place to find Video actor for different job roles  like Firefighter , security guard, police officer etc
[17.10.24, 0:56:21] ~ Facundo: Hey guys, any good freelancer that can do basic Klaviyo flow set up?
[17.10.24, 1:03:01] ~ Anesh Pillai: This guy from upwork worked well for me - https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/bogdanrediuk
[17.10.24, 1:03:37] ~ Anesh Pillai: Reasonably priced too.
[17.10.24, 1:04:28] ~ Akshay: Backstage
[17.10.24, 2:33:22] ~ Rúben Costa: Hello guys, does anyone know of any AI app for responding to chargebacks? ‎<This message was edited>
[17.10.24, 2:47:30] ~ Christopher Murphy: Can anyone refer me to a good video editor for VSLs? Ideally have experience in motion graphics/animation as well.
[17.10.24, 7:20:46] ~ Anesh Pillai: Anyone have used influee for testimonial videos, Is it worth it ?
‎[17.10.24, 7:23:37] ~ Anesh Pillai: ‎image omitted
[17.10.24, 7:24:27] ~ Mikael: But then you also pay for each UGC creator and each video they make. also you need to pay extra if you want to use their video editor on the platform etc. But yeah I think it worked very well overall
[17.10.24, 7:25:09] ~ Akshay: How much would you say it worked out to per video by the end of it for you?
[17.10.24, 7:26:31] ~ Caesar: if u stay subbed for 3-4 months, then try to cancel, it lets you keep the sub for 99EUR (pro tip!) 

its expensive imo, but easy to keep track of the UGC creators, many of them are downright spergs so a platform to manage them helps so so much rather then sourcing them from Facebook and then finally getting them to make that video after so many weeks...
[17.10.24, 7:26:40] ~ Mikael: This varies heavily. as each creator takes their own fee. they take Everything from 0-500 depending on how skilled they are. some do for free just to get some content themselves
[17.10.24, 7:29:09] ~ Akshay: I’ve been using trend and am pretty happy with it. If you make a detailed brief and tell them what you want, you can get good videos from $100-$300 ish per
[17.10.24, 8:26:01] ~ Anesh Pillai: Ohh so that is just platform fee.. Thats adds up then..
[17.10.24, 8:26:35] ~ Anesh Pillai: Have you guys tried AI UGC at Creatify. It seems to be very realistic so far ..
[17.10.24, 8:41:19] ~ Olli: I have it’s very good
[17.10.24, 9:48:20] ~ Adam K.: How do you deal with influee UGC creators where they have almost "unlimited" time to create videos , in a past I was waiting 2-3 weeks for first video + 1 week for corrections and support did nothing ( product sent to influencer ) ( and of course depends on creator )
[17.10.24, 10:37:21] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: About this, we will cut all our Funnelish funnel because drop of CVR some day vs Shopify

Anyone know how to fix?

We have same LP on Shopify and Funnelish and some day CVR drop only for Funnelish
[17.10.24, 10:41:13] ~ RS: Yesterday funnelish glitched af. I checked with Microsoft clarity, and when people tried to pay by PayPal, it just show error “PayPal authentication failed” or something like that. The customer hasnt even redirected to PayPal. The error show up right after clicking the buy button. I also replicated this issue on my end. And after 5 minutes everything worked fine without me making any changes in funnel. Support just told that there might be incorrect PayPal credentials that is a total bullshit because I never changed anything. Now it works fine but cannot Trust funnelish. You need to check if there are no glitches all the time
[17.10.24, 11:14:22] ~ Powa: I’ve had a similar issue, and what worked for me was switching to a payment processor that's registered in the same country where you're selling. My acceptance rate increase from 75% to 90%
[17.10.24, 11:30:46] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: We got the same problem.. I think we will not use Funnelish anymore if nothing is fixed
[17.10.24, 11:31:03] ~ Matteo Pellegrini: What king of processor?
[17.10.24, 14:17:45] Alex  Fedotoff: Team, won’t be able to join the weekly call today, at the mastermind event. Please send me your questions directly here on WhatsApp so I can help you out

[17.10.24, 18:01:55] ~ Mason: Alex, Q for you: when you’re looking to reduce CAC which do you feel is a bigger needle mover: testing new creative format (like video vs img ads) or testing a new advertorial with a new angle, headline, and body copy (using existing winning ads)
[17.10.24, 18:44:32] ~ Anesh Pillai: Hey Alex, Really informative video uploaded today on Facebooks Ads Optimization

[17.10.24, 22:03:21] ~ Akshay: Hi everyone, been watching some of the videos from the Elite live event in Budapest, some of the speakers mention they will share some resources with people present, I was wondering if someone could share these with me? Specifically looking for Steve Erl's swipe file for advertorials, and his excel sheet of headline formulas to try.
[17.10.24, 22:32:38] Jordi: I would also like those!
[17.10.24, 23:41:15] ~ Anesh Pillai: 💯, please share to me as well
[18.10.24, 5:42:53] ~ Anesh Pillai: Any suggestion where you can get raw footages (not stock) VSL video creation ?
[18.10.24, 6:33:08] Jordi: U can contact ugc creators on fiverr and ask for broll
[18.10.24, 6:37:44] ~ Anesh Pillai: okay, didnt know about broll
[18.10.24, 6:40:12] Jordi: Yeaa its a video editing term 😅
[18.10.24, 6:41:33] Jordi: It means basically everything that is not the main action
[18.10.24, 6:43:59] ~ Anesh Pillai: Gotcha..
[18.10.24, 8:05:02] ~ Anesh Pillai: Anyone else find Funnelish support useless ? or is it just the reps I have been getting lately.
[18.10.24, 8:13:11] René Crooijmans: Useless unless it's Ana who is replying
[18.10.24, 8:20:22] ~ Caesar: ^^
[18.10.24, 8:20:56] ~ Caesar: they basically just copy-paste some templates and then if you keep pestering them they'll forward you to their tech / IT team, then you can get some proper help but that usually takes many many days
[18.10.24, 12:41:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone here that uses airwallex, and integrated Klarna in Funnelish with a custom API through Airwallex?
[18.10.24, 14:47:50] René Crooijmans: Is someone here using Finix as a payment processor in the US and also facing a lot of unsuccessful payments in the past few days? 

Recommendations for other payment providers are also welcome 
[18.10.24, 16:29:41] ~ Jacob: Its not possible atm
[18.10.24, 16:29:53] ~ Jacob: I already talk to them

[18.10.24, 17:36:59] Carlos Leeseman: Does someone know how to setup funnelish sales page to shopify checkout?
[18.10.24, 17:45:38] Matán Intsuper: Just change the url of the cta in ur Funnelish sales page
[18.10.24, 17:50:56] Carlos Leeseman: What CTA link? Like how does the link look like?
[18.10.24, 17:51:30] Carlos Leeseman: And will FB track the sale?
[18.10.24, 17:52:21] Matán Intsuper: you need to create a checkout link for the product using the Buy Button app in Shopify.
[18.10.24, 17:52:40] Matán Intsuper: The CTA link in your sales page (e.g "Buy Now For 70% Off")
[18.10.24, 17:53:03] Matán Intsuper: If you have the pixel both on FB and Shopify it will track. I use Converge for tracking.
[18.10.24, 17:53:22] ~ Joran: How accurate has converge been for u?
[18.10.24, 17:53:45] Matán Intsuper: pretty accurate when we checked at the beginning, didn't actually check again
[18.10.24, 17:53:48] Carlos Leeseman: Got it
[18.10.24, 18:09:46] ~ Mike Ramsey: Do you know when this will be done?  I heard it was supposed to be set up by now.
[18.10.24, 18:52:39] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Ok thanks!
[18.10.24, 20:37:58] ~ L: Guys, I’ve increased the budget of one CBO by 130%

The first day after that wasn’t particularly profitable, and today is the second day, but it’s still not performing as expected.

Should I keep waiting or decrease the budget?

How long do you let optimise after a big increase of budget?
[18.10.24, 20:40:03] ~ Joran: did u increase it in one go by 130%?
[18.10.24, 20:40:14] ~ Joran: like lets say 100 > 230?
[18.10.24, 20:41:58] ~ Joran: I always scale down after 2 days bad performance by 25%
[18.10.24, 20:51:34] ~ L: yes
[18.10.24, 20:51:47] ~ Joran: Doesnt that reset the learning?
[18.10.24, 20:52:20] ~ L: Didn’t really care 😅
[18.10.24, 20:52:38] ~ Joran: Well that could be why it didnt perform i guess
[18.10.24, 20:53:46] ~ L: It was running at 150$ and didn’t want to take it too slow so I scaled up to 350$ overnight - Percentage wise is a big scale but actual amount didn’t seem to high actually

[18.10.24, 22:41:35] ~ Mason: I noticed the same after increasing from $150 to $200 then $250 next day. Went back down to $200 and took about 3-4 days for performance to stabilize. Next time I plan to go up only 20% every 3 days
[19.10.24, 1:45:33] ~ Anesh Pillai: What is your recommended  ecommerce CRM which can handle Tickets and CRM to keep in touch with customers ?
[19.10.24, 15:47:48] Carlos Leeseman: Hi guys, we want do duplicate our Shopify store to other markets, can we just export or theme and import in new store? Or do we need to buy the theme again on the 2nd store?
[19.10.24, 15:57:08] Jordi: Why dont u just use a translator?? Or will u build 2 different stores? Im doing it at the moment with bulgaria and the rest of the world and its working really good
[19.10.24, 15:58:08] Carlos Leeseman: We’re trying, but so much goes wrong continuously. If I use checkout link of a specific language, it jumps to English when someone else uses that link
[19.10.24, 16:45:11] ~ Sonu Duhra: I had 3 stores for 3 markets and paid 3x for everything, for the plan, the apps. Then got them to 1 store, used Weglot, got bigger Shopify plan for better fees.
[19.10.24, 16:46:29] ~ Sonu Duhra: and yes, you also be paying for the theme on the new store, otherwise you will get a DMCA.

[21.10.24, 13:06:39] ~ Dan: Funnelish automatically compresses images and converts them to .Webp format … this normally works great, but on certain images, it messes up the quality… I’ve found the best way to remedy this is to double the resolution of the original image, and it comes out a lot better quality 👍

[23.10.24, 19:11:12] ~ L: Guys when launching a new brand , would you start off of interests targeting (to “help” the pixel) or broad since day 1?
[23.10.24, 19:58:01] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I've had positive results going broad from day 1
[23.10.24, 21:09:05] ~ Sonu Duhra: I tried a few time with broad on a new pixel and had crazy CMP‘s then switched to interest targeting and CPM decreased about 40%, also depends how big the market size is.
[23.10.24, 21:13:39] ~ Sonu Duhra: I would say yes if it is the same audience which I assume if it is the same product, both stores would feed the same pixel
[23.10.24, 21:16:58] ~ Christopher Murphy: Opposite experience for me. Went broad on a new ad account and had ~$150 CPMs so tried interest which then bumped the CPMs up to ~$200 CPM😅 still struggling with this issue in this ad account
[23.10.24, 21:23:35] ~ Sonu Duhra: Ok that’s weird man, then it’s another issue and not the pixel
[23.10.24, 22:10:46] Jordi: Same here... broad is always cheaper for me!

[24.10.24, 2:06:41] ~ Akshay: Hi everyone, I think someone on this chat a few days ago was talking about how they have a 3PL/service in the US that accepts returns only so you don’t have to ship it back to China but can reuse the products
Does anyone know of such a service?
[24.10.24, 7:21:15] Jordi: I think @⁨~Jamie Melia⁩ does
[24.10.24, 13:21:53] ~ Jamie Melia: Yeah a lot of 3PL will do this. I use Shipmonk, but they also stock and ship out. I’m not sure they would just handle a return. 

For the US market, before I had the 3PL I just set up a cheap post box at a UPS store with my brand name on it and sent returns there.
[24.10.24, 15:13:34] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: There is a company called Loopreturns.com that can help you with this.  My close friend is head of business development there. Feel free to DM me and I’d be happy to make an introduction.

[24.10.24, 23:29:01] ~ Austin: I'm running my first VSL and find when clicking over from the VSL page to the shopify page the product page load speed is very slowwww, how do you fix that and what causes it? My page speed is typically excellent.

[25.10.24, 12:38:04] ~ Joran: When adding a main domain for proper funnelish wetrackd tracking do you just add your existing shopify domain or a completely new one?
[25.10.24, 18:21:17] ~ Anesh Pillai: Hey guys, I am using Microsoft Clarity on Funnelish. I am seeing a dropoff happen in checkout page which clarity is not capturing atm. 

Is there a way to enable tracking on the checkout page?
[25.10.24, 18:21:59] ~ Mason: Highly recommend you use another tool. Clarity is super buggy
[25.10.24, 18:22:09] ~ Mason: I use Mouseflow.com
[25.10.24, 18:22:15] ~ Mason: Tracks my checkout
[25.10.24, 18:28:19] ~ Anesh Pillai: Nice.. So Mouseflow track the checkout page. I will check it out.
[25.10.24, 18:28:54] ~ Mason: Tracks all pages
[25.10.24, 18:29:57] ~ Anesh Pillai: Prefect. They have a free trial too, I will check them out
‎[25.10.24, 19:58:51] ~ Anesh Pillai: ‎image omitted
[25.10.24, 19:59:36] ~ Mason: I use a 2-step checkout. I have a 50% checkout visit to purchase rate
[25.10.24, 19:59:57] ~ Mason: I think it depends on your entire funnel and price
[25.10.24, 20:00:40] ~ Anesh Pillai: Good rate.. Do you reveal the price before the checkout ?
[25.10.24, 20:01:13] ~ Anesh Pillai: I am seeing a drop off at checkout page, so I am thinking if we were able to do 2 step checkout, we can retarget them with emails if they drop off
[25.10.24, 20:17:41] ~ Mason: I reveal the price on product page but my product is only $39. Also, if you use a one page checkout, funnelish has an auto opt in feature so you’ll collect emails with or without a 2-step
[25.10.24, 20:25:46] ~ Kevin Krieg: Does anybody know of a good resource to give a video editor about very "edit-heavy" videos? Think the OG hormozi style editing. Lot of diferent text, animations, effects...

So far we barely do any editing in our creatives. Only basic stuff, very UGC style. 

We want to expand to other formats though and want him to learn. Would love to pass him a course or sth so he can level up.
[25.10.24, 20:33:58] ~ Jacobo Uribe: The AdsRx course is pretty sweet. It’s more for direct response Ecom, but much higher level editing there. We have a copy of it in the ESS classroom.
[27.10.24, 6:39:44] Suyi: Hey ESS team 

Does anyone know a good 3D  animator ?
[27.10.24, 6:40:28] Topi: dmed
[27.10.24, 6:41:08] ~ P: Hey, do you know where exactly in the ESS classroom this can be found?
[27.10.24, 6:49:40] Bob: Phase 16 is the AdsRX course
[27.10.24, 20:59:41] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Hey guys, what metric do you see on the fb ads? Cost per unique outbound click, or just Cost per unique link click?

My unique link click costs $73 cents, but the outbound like $1.45 😅😆
[27.10.24, 22:43:32] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Both. But to take any decision –definitely outbound
[27.10.24, 22:44:11] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Great, thanks!😃
[27.10.24, 22:44:18] ~ Robert Gonzalez: I gotta find better creatives then haha
[27.10.24, 22:46:23] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Haha yes. Unfortunately outbound is always higher, but that’s your real number
[28.10.24, 18:30:06] ~ Veronika: Hey guys, is anyone else noticing unusual changes in performance since Sunday? Curious if others are experiencing the same?
[28.10.24, 18:30:30] Matán Intsuper: Yes, unusually good
[28.10.24, 18:33:22] ~ Veronika: vice versa for us, from 30% profit to unprofitable
[28.10.24, 18:35:37] Matán Intsuper: Maybe your customers decided to buy from us 😜
[28.10.24, 19:11:21] ~ Joran: What do some of you guys do with an adset thats performing very well on low spend (20eu) but when i triple duplicate it to 3x 100 eu it doesnt perform. try cbo/adv+? ‎<This message was edited>

[29.10.24, 6:52:29] ~ Mason: Hey all, any of you guys successfully implement a community-based subscription as an upsell? Thinking of upselling a skool community as my core product is education based
[29.10.24, 9:05:13] ~ Mikael: Hey fam. We launched 2 new brands with all new assets (except 1 brand that is using old pixel).

Both of these brands run fb agency ads accs. But they have 2-3x higher CPC and CPM than any of our other brands. Even same niche.

Anyone know why or had similur?
[29.10.24, 9:13:09] Jordi: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ did hahaha
[29.10.24, 11:05:21] ~ Santi Roa: How long did you had the old brand running?
[29.10.24, 11:05:30] ~ Santi Roa: And when did you launch these 2 new brands?
[29.10.24, 11:09:10] ~ Santi Roa: That's normal, I'd say.
Here are a few theories, and it depends on the question's answers:

1) Social proof. Your old brand probably looks more legit because it already has more online presence (i.e 20k social media followers vs 200)

2) Top of funnel.
People often see our ads between 3-7 times before buying. It varies depending on your brand but usually only 30% buys the first day they find your brand. Another 30% buys between 1 and 7 days, and the rest might take up to 6 months to buy
[29.10.24, 11:09:18] ~ Santi Roa: You can survey that
[29.10.24, 11:51:19] ~ Olli: Hey guys has anyone used Shopify capital? I received my first one 3/4 weeks ago and fully paid it off early and am now waiting for more offers to appear. The payment hasn’t fully processed and left my bank yet but has anyone been offered a second or not?
[29.10.24, 11:51:31] ~ Olli: I haven’t seen a new offer appear yet
[29.10.24, 15:40:22] ~ Mikael: Okey thx for the response 🙏
[29.10.24, 15:42:12] ~ Mikael: Do anyone know if its okey by Facebook to run 2 different ads account from 2 different BMs for the same product and to the same store?
[29.10.24, 15:46:20] ~ Facundo: I´m doing this since last week without any problem so far
[29.10.24, 15:53:20] ~ Austin: Did the CRO call happen today? I just logged on and it said host hasn't started call.
[29.10.24, 15:54:05] ~ Austin: I was just offered a Shopify Capital loan Friday
[29.10.24, 16:00:10] ~ Jamie Melia: It can take a while, I did the same on mine a while back.

Contacted support to clear the message in the end
[29.10.24, 16:55:02] ~ Mikael: Okwy thank you for the answer 🙏

[30.10.24, 21:20:03] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hey Guys, anyone know how to change the currency in the cart with Shopify? (Without using Shopify Payments) 

In the store, using an app works fine, and for checkout i’m using an external checkout to allow this. However, I can’t find a solution for the cart. ‎<This message was edited>
[31.10.24, 8:23:54] ~ RS: Anybody else has strange ad performance today? My roas is high, profit margin is 54%, and cpms (Also cpcs) are 2-3x lower than usual. Never had these stats before even though I run this brand for 6 months and I spend 5k a day for the last 30 days. Also, adspend is 50% lower at this time comparing to previous days. Its 9am for my ad acc time now and at this time usually FB has spent 50% more budget than it has spent now. Of course, its very good performance but I have not seen anything close like this in these 6 months. Like, my breakeven roas is 1.12 but my roas today is 4. Also, daiky adspend is 5500$ but at 9am it has spent only 900$.
[31.10.24, 8:29:55] ~ Olli: Unusual day so far for me as well , I usually do 2.5-5K days but had 1K so far today. (5pm) Only 60% through budget but normally much higher by now consistently
[31.10.24, 8:31:01] ~ Olli: Also @⁨~RS⁩ could your ad spend sustain above 5K or did it stabilise around there?
[31.10.24, 8:33:32] ~ RS: Its 5k-5.5k currently depending on how much test adsets I launch. My scaling ASCs and CBO’s spends almost the same every day. Not taisija budget for this month because of stock issues and payment provider holds yet
[31.10.24, 8:35:37] ~ Olli: Interesting, thanks for the insight!
[31.10.24, 9:09:33] ~ Adam K.: What about currency converter apps , i think it was showing properly in cart but not in checkout , but as you are using external checkout , should work :)
[31.10.24, 9:46:55] Jordi: Gethookd down again? 🤔
[31.10.24, 9:51:14] ~ Tiberio: Hey guys, i’m launching ads in new countries for the same product. The first day is pretty good compared to the main country, but from the second day results are unstable with low Roas. How would you explain this?
[31.10.24, 10:07:55] ~ Rick: Maybe try forplay
[31.10.24, 10:18:24] Jordi: Ahh thanks ill try that
[31.10.24, 10:49:48] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey team! Won’t be able to do a call today. Travelling all day. Please hit me up in DMs with specific questions I can help you with
[31.10.24, 15:35:59] ~ Chris Rivera: Hey for foreigners - has Shopify asked any of you to prove physical presence in the US for a Shopify payments account in the US?  If so, what did you provide to prove it?

I think this may be something new that Shopify is asking for ‎<This message was edited>
[31.10.24, 15:40:31] ~ lengjoo: i’ve heard about this even last year, they require you to have residential address to use US shopify payments
[31.10.24, 15:43:26] Jordi: @⁨~Jamie Melia⁩ used a 3PL from the US and gave that address
[31.10.24, 15:44:57] ~ Jamie Melia: Yes @⁨Jordi⁩ is correct. I use Shipmonk 3PL, and simply providing the agreement with them was enough to make them happy.

So the 3PL warehouse address is my physical location in Shopify
[31.10.24, 15:56:15] ~ Chris Rivera: Thanks guys!
[31.10.24, 16:09:20] Matán Intsuper: From my experience they request from some people and from some don’t
[31.10.24, 16:17:07] ~ Natasha Iris: For all non US residents there’s no exception. Those merchants just haven’t been caught yet

US Requirements: 
- Personal address (must be different from business. Not necessarily the case for US residents) 
- Business address - no P.O. Box and cannot use registered agents address 

- ITIN - we do have a bank who can setup without an ITIN
[31.10.24, 16:18:38] ~ Santiago: Utility bill from my 3pl and proof of inventory
[31.10.24, 16:22:48] ~ Antonio: anyone seeing a massive down dns for every website ? clickfunnels, shopify backend
[31.10.24, 16:49:28] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey Chris, Natasha from Compaytence payments team. For those mentioning 3PL, you may use this for business address. But do you have a physical personal address? 

Using just a 3PL probably wouldn’t satisfy all requirements ‎<This message was edited>
[31.10.24, 16:51:50] ~ Chris Rivera: We have a bunch of clients that are in a situation where they’re foreign but doing business in the US. 

I’ve seen this request before but it’s pretty rare which likely means that most of our clients are able to circumvent without even telling us.  Just curious to see what other people do when asked.  

Such a bright and high level group here.  Thanks guys !
[31.10.24, 16:55:20] Jordi: Jamie did and it was enough
[31.10.24, 17:02:57] ~ Jamie Melia: Yes physical personal address (foreign) provided also.
After this they wanted to confirm physical presence of business operations, which the 3PL and inventory was sufficient ‎<This message was edited>

[1.11.24, 17:34:46] ~ Jacob: hi guys, i have a question for you all: *which audiences expect the broad targeting, works for you best in meta?* 
- look a like audiences
- retargeting (which kind? site visits? 90 days? etc...)

or you dont use those usually?
[1.11.24, 17:36:24] ~ Jacob: like sometimes you try to revive an ad just by changing audience for example, from broad to look a like? or it doesnet really works usually
[1.11.24, 19:45:55] ~ Natasha Iris: Perfect don’t fix what isn’t broke! Also spoke with stripe AE about this as well and they agreed with you. 🙏🏼

[3.11.24, 8:16:12] ~ M: Yes got it too. This is what our agency acc provider forwarded to us:

👩🏻‍💻According to Meta’s latest announcement, starting in October 2024, Meta will implement ❗️identity verification❗️ for certain advertisers, aiming to enhance platform security. Here are the key details and action guidelines you should be aware of:
1. Identity Verification Notification: From 【October 21st】, advertisers selected for the pilot program will receive a notification to complete identity verification. This message will appear in your Ads Manager, and you will have approximately two weeks to complete the process.
2. Identity Verification Requirements: At least one administrator of the advertising account must verify their identity using a government-issued ID to gain permission to publish advertisements. Accepted forms of ID include ‼️passports, driver’s licenses, and resident ID cards‼️. Please note that in some cases, other users in the ad account may also need to be verified before they can post ads.
3. Verification Process: If you receive a verification notification, please follow the prompts in the Ads Manager to get started. Select the types of ID documents accepted by Meta and click “Continue” after uploading. Upload your photo and submit your ID. After submission, you can expect to receive a notification regarding the decision, typically 【 within 48 hours 】. Be sure to complete the verification promptly to avoid any disruptions in ad serving.

I plan to  be in Thailand for 60 days or more, and I dont have a return ticket. Chatgpt says that in Thailand they can ask you for a return ticket or booking to make sure you will not be there for longer than 60 days. Because I can go to Thailand for 60 days without Visa but after that I need to extend it

[12.11.24, 19:14:06] ~ L: I thought about that too, it’s Anti-aging niche - US

Do you guys think it’s normal ?
[12.11.24, 19:15:30] Jordi: Not normal but possible! I had the same issue

[12.11.24, 19:15:48] ~ Jamie Melia: That niche will be expensive for sure.

Those CPMs are filthy high though 😂

They can settle down after a while, I normally let it run and build up quite a few impressions before worrying.
Stick to the guidelines around CPMs in general like, improving engagement and relevance for your audience

[14.11.24, 8:45:47] ~ Giu: Hey guys! Does someone knows how to sell organic products in the US? It’s tricky for us to find a supplier directly in the US and we dont know if possible to import from China. ‎<This message was edited>
[14.11.24, 9:25:22] ~ Mikael: Hey fam, anyone using AIrwallex - Klarna with Funnelish? I integrated it but it got some weird issue "Klarna does not accept SEK in Sweden".

But at the same time Everything with Klarna and SEK is working correctly on my Shopify store.

Did anyone experience this same issue and how did you solve it?
[14.11.24, 12:57:40] ~ Jacob: Send message to airwallex support
[14.11.24, 13:37:02] ~ Mikael: Yeah I got in contact with them. They said I need to wait for 1-2 days.. lets hope this is the issue

[14.11.24, 20:15:56] Matán Intsuper: Hey guys, I have an old jewelry store that sells to the USA with a lot of recurring customers.

It makes around 15 to 20 K usd revenue per month with zero work (email/sms/push/google pmax/fb adv+ catalog, criteo retargeting - all evergreen campaigns)

I’m looking to hire someone with Shopify and Facebook and Google Ads experience to manage it and scale it (or sell it).

Any suggestions/referrals? ‎<This message was edited>
[14.11.24, 20:54:47] ~ Santi Roa: Will you give this person equity? Are you looking a kinda entrepreneur to give him an already started/successful project?

Or just an employee to keep running it better?
[14.11.24, 20:55:09] Matán Intsuper: I was thinking about an employee, but if it’s someone really good I can consider equity

[15.11.24, 19:36:40] ~ Jacob: do it on the ad or ad set tab
[15.11.24, 19:37:51] ~ Jacob: as i see it now, its playing with variations to get the best result, in the past its just put all the money on one, but now, its not doing that, i got 8 conversions today, and the distrubition was 4, 3, 1
[15.11.24, 19:38:55] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Same with me
[15.11.24, 19:39:06] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Don’t work for me
[15.11.24, 19:39:21] ~ Jacob: it's a bug
[15.11.24, 19:39:28] ~ Jacob: it's happening sometimes unfortuantely
[15.11.24, 19:39:32] ~ Jacob: duplicate it
[15.11.24, 19:39:41] ~ Jacob: i had a adset with the same problem
[15.11.24, 19:39:43] ~ Jacob: nothing to do
[15.11.24, 19:39:44] ~ Jacob: :(
[15.11.24, 19:40:11] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I spoke with support because I thought it might be a bug, but they said this feature will no longer be available. Some accounts still have it, while others don’t.
[15.11.24, 19:40:12] ~ Jacob: but...you can see in the notifications, which ad got the most engagement...and this is probably one of the winners
[15.11.24, 19:40:27] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Yeah, is what I’m doing
[15.11.24, 19:40:49] ~ Jacob: dont belive them lol
[15.11.24, 19:41:07] ~ Jacob: try duplicating a few and see if you have the same problem
[15.11.24, 19:41:26] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I know, but I confirmed with some people, and some have it while others don’t.

[15.11.24, 19:50:28] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys! Any way on how to deal with TikTok ad account bans?
[15.11.24, 19:56:24] ~ Jacob: I don't have black and white answer but here are my insights:

1.) On how much data you took this decision? it's important to share this when you are asking this kind of question? and how much days the test ran?
2.) I don't think the downstream revenue is the problem, it's not really a complicated feature that will cause problems, i dont think the problem there
3.) about the facebook theory, it could be, but i dont think it's the reason
4.) i just think that (1) things flop. like you have a super strong ad running for 2-3 days and than it dies. (2) only 3 days passed, i suggest you have a look after 1 week, and if it's still sucks, roll back to the previous one.
[15.11.24, 19:57:08] ~ Jacob: hope it helps :)
[16.11.24, 5:42:07] ~ Mikael: ANyone using Airwallex with Funnelish? We have some "errors" so its not working..
[16.11.24, 6:00:03] Amit Wadhawan: I had this issue a few months ago… I contacted Funnelish and Airwallex and neither of them were helpful in figuring out what was going on with it.
[16.11.24, 6:00:30] ~ Mikael: Yeah. This is why I am asking here... Did you get it solved any how?
[16.11.24, 6:01:20] Amit Wadhawan: I just switched to a different payment processor on Funnelish.
[16.11.24, 6:06:51] ~ Mikael: Ah okey. Not that easy for me atm. As we use Airwallex due to many thnigs
[16.11.24, 6:18:18] Amit Wadhawan: Yeah. I was lucky that I had a backup. Airwallex had told us that the issue was something on Funnelish’s side but Funnelish wasn’t able to figure it out back then. Try again with them and see if you can get it sorted out.
[16.11.24, 6:19:42] ~ Mikael: Man allways something.. ill just try with both. I know friends who use airwallex witj funnelish and didnt have any issues
[16.11.24, 10:42:04] ~ Y: What errors are you facing?
[16.11.24, 10:42:53] ~ Mikael: Payment methods arnt working so it says "error: This transaction is blocked due to risk concern"
[16.11.24, 10:43:44] ~ Y: Hmm tried checking airwallex why it’s showing that?
[16.11.24, 10:44:01] ~ Mikael: yeah, SO far they are not much of an help
[16.11.24, 10:44:56] ~ Y: Ok pm me your checkout url and send me the transaction id and will raise it internally
[16.11.24, 13:48:23] ~ Jacob: No issues
[16.11.24, 13:48:55] ~ Jacob: Which country are u operating
[16.11.24, 13:49:35] ~ Jacob: One of the problems i found is that u need to send the country
[16.11.24, 13:49:42] ~ Jacob: Of the person who buys
[16.11.24, 13:49:56] ~ Jacob: There need to be a field
[16.11.24, 13:50:27] ~ Jacob: Both of support of airwallex and funnelish are helpful but i think its more on funnelish side
[16.11.24, 13:50:45] ~ Jacob: Talk with belen from funnelish she was always super helpful
[16.11.24, 13:51:47] ~ Jacob: And which payments methods are u using with airwallex
[16.11.24, 13:52:08] ~ Jacob: Be specific as u can to get the best help
[16.11.24, 13:54:43] ~ Jacob: I understand also that the paypal of airwallex not functioning so good
[16.11.24, 13:54:56] ~ Jacob: So its better to use external one
[16.11.24, 16:27:51] ~ Mikael: Yes the country selection is there. We use mainly Klarna + cards. Belen is the best and most helpful haha 💪 are you using airwallex with funnelish?
[16.11.24, 19:49:50] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey brand builders! Wanted to share with you the product research process I do with Gethookd https://www.loom.com/share/3bbee63643fe4cceb804ed56aaf0b968?sid=fc2904cb-6845-445c-820b-bd4012c72690

Let me know if you find it valuable!
[17.11.24, 1:06:26] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Guys, I urgently need your opinion. 

We’re using Shopify Payments with a new brand, and we’re scaling fastt. However, we already know that Shopify Payments may have issues with sudden scaling like we had before so I’m considering switching to Stripe with my LLC. Given it’s a new account, what do you suggest?

1 - Should I continue scaling with the new Stripe account?

2 - Should I stabilize sales for a while? (This isn’t really the plan)

3 - Should I alternate between payment processors for now?

Also, what payment processors would you recommend, considering that our main market is the UK?

Thank you 🙏🏼
[17.11.24, 1:11:16] Matán Intsuper: Shopify payments is safer than stripe for scaling
[17.11.24, 1:29:09] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I've always heard the opposite, but given that in one week we have 50 orders a day and we're ready to scale, even if it's not much, it's a new account. Do you think we can go to 200/300.. with Shopify payments?
[17.11.24, 1:37:22] Matán Intsuper: You should always scale slowly
[17.11.24, 1:37:27] ~ Santi Roa: I created a new store for my brand last month. We are doing about 100k day through it without any issues.
[17.11.24, 1:38:07] ~ JULIUS: Shopify payments are great, just make sure to fulfill your orders within 24h + installing chargeback prevent apps such as chargeflow.

Also ideally you want to scale weekly, not 0 to 300 daily orders within a week
[17.11.24, 1:38:08] Matán Intsuper: No matter what payment processor you’ll use, fast scaling will get you audited and probably they will hold some of your money
[17.11.24, 1:39:22] ~ Santi Roa: 1st week: 20k day
2nd week: 35k day
3rd week: 60k day
4th week 95k /day
[17.11.24, 1:40:05] ~ Santi Roa: If I were you I would create the stripe acc just in case but keep using shopify for as long as you can
[17.11.24, 1:41:10] ~ Santi Roa: So I wanted to emphasize that is not always about shopify or the payment processing, but more about how you behave as a business/brand.

Always have backups, though ‎<This message was edited>
[17.11.24, 1:41:29] ~ JULIUS: Also what you can do : alternate between Stripe & Shopify Payments, that way you warm-up each and will have a back-up
[17.11.24, 1:47:54] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Thank you guys! 🙏🏼
[17.11.24, 1:51:53] Matán Intsuper: Only if you can do 50/50, but now 1 week this and 1 week that
[17.11.24, 16:57:11] ~ L: Guys we have a Paypal account that got “restricted” and is waiting to be reactivated 

We have another Paypal account that I want to link to not waste time waiting for the other one. 

Do you think the 2nd Paypal account will be effected if we don’t change domain/store information?
Or I can just link the new one to shopify?
[17.11.24, 17:38:27] ~ Santi Roa: I think the 2nd account will definitely be affected
[17.11.24, 17:38:47] ~ Santi Roa: Domain, tax ID, company name, your personal information, etc
[17.11.24, 17:59:15] ~ JULIUS: You will need to have separate company details, if it's the same info -> you will get flagged and loose 2nd account
[17.11.24, 17:59:32] ~ JULIUS: Regarding the domain I don't have any experience on that one!
[17.11.24, 18:07:46] Matán Intsuper: It’s a matter of luck. If you’re willing to risk it, try it. I have 4 linked PayPal accounts and they act independently whatsoever
[17.11.24, 18:14:37] ~ Santi Roa: Have you ever gotten one banned and not the others?
[17.11.24, 18:15:05] Matán Intsuper: Fortunately I’ve never got banned on PayPal but I had plenty of issues that never affected the other ones
[17.11.24, 18:15:08] ~ Santi Roa: I used to think they acted independently until they banned me one. Instantly, they banned all
[17.11.24, 18:16:54] Matán Intsuper: I understand, there are different level of bans.
[17.11.24, 18:17:07] Matán Intsuper: Sometimes it’s just a specific account, sometimes it’s global on the person behind it
[17.11.24, 18:17:34] Matán Intsuper: If his other PayPal account isn’t banned, it probably means it was a specific ban
[17.11.24, 19:00:20] Amit Wadhawan: What’s the key to you being able to scale that quickly?
[17.11.24, 19:01:13] ~ Mason: I’m also wondering this

[18.11.24, 20:59:14] ~ Mason: Hey all, curious if majority of you guys use a separate campaign for testing creatives OR if you just test creatives in a new adset within your scaling campaign using CBO ‎<This message was edited>
[18.11.24, 20:59:43] ~ Mason: My media buyer is arguing that we should test creatives in a whole new campaign. Curious what you guys do / recommend
[18.11.24, 21:21:37] ~ JULIUS: I heard about 1 really simple structure (didn't personally try, but you can) :
1 ABO campaign where you will be testing each creatives separately
1 CBO campaign where you will be scaling winning creatives there

If you do test this, let me know 😃
[18.11.24, 22:51:29] ~ Santiago: Best approach for me is to put 45 creatives weekly into one CBO and let meta decide where it wants to spend
[18.11.24, 23:05:32] ~ Mason: If you don’t mind me asking bro, how much you spend on ads per month?
[18.11.24, 23:19:27] ~ JULIUS: Someone from EU living in EU and found a reliable solution to either get as low VAT taxes or completely avoid them? (Besides the classic HK setup)
[18.11.24, 23:21:28] ~ Santiago: Like 15-20k daily
[18.11.24, 23:22:49] ~ Anesh Pillai: What is the HK setup ?
[18.11.24, 23:23:19] ~ Anesh Pillai: Tricky situation. I looked into it especially in the UK where VAT is 20% it should can make the product economics very tight 

The best solution I heard about is have a US corp and have the product stored at a Chinese 3PL to ship directly to the customers in the EU
[18.11.24, 23:47:15] ~ JULIUS: Just to summarize quickly, HK (Honkong company) will be under a nominee and all assets will be under your chinese supplier/agent with an agreement. Then you collect payments on their behalf and get paid yourself with whatever company you want
[18.11.24, 23:47:47] ~ JULIUS: Basically you just put the responsability of VAT collect to the chinese side 🙃
[18.11.24, 23:49:14] ~ Anesh Pillai: EU VAT is a pain….. I am curious how other ecommerce people are dealing with this.
[18.11.24, 23:50:02] ~ JULIUS: Same! It's eating a looot of margins
[18.11.24, 23:50:50] ~ L: What don’t you like about this structure?
[18.11.24, 23:51:30] ~ Allan L: Payment options. A bit limited for some countries
[18.11.24, 23:53:58] ~ JULIUS: In some EU countries they savages with taxes 😂 In case they inspect on this case & setup, I couldn't explain really to them why I collect supplier's money AND making "their" advertising, while having a payment processor in 2024 isn't the most complicated thing
[18.11.24, 23:54:32] ~ JULIUS: That's the only downside I could be worries, besides that, it's strong
[18.11.24, 23:54:38] ~ Anesh Pillai: Isnt it a bit too risky having your all your asset that you paid for under a chineese supplier ? ‎<This message was edited>
[18.11.24, 23:54:56] ~ JULIUS: If you love outside EU, I think you're definitely more safe than living in EU
[18.11.24, 23:56:09] ~ JULIUS: There's never 0% risk unfortunately, but definitely not that high when you work with the right person
[19.11.24, 13:25:25] ~ Thomas Dolcini: Hey guys we are doing 30-40k days on a daily but are having trouble getting past this. Anybody here would like to chat about creatives, offers, media buying? Allways happy to connect! 🙂

[19.11.24, 18:23:18] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey guys,

I’m looking for a reliable contact for a US lawyer who specializes in trademark law. A Chinese company has started the process of registering a trademark using our brand name in the same niche as our products. I need someone experienced to help us file an opposition and protect our brand rights.

If you know of a good lawyer or firm who can handle this, please let me know. Thanks in advance!
[19.11.24, 18:31:19] ~ David B: Thanks to everyone on the call today. If you watch it back later and want access to anything I shared, just let me know and I'll send it over. See you in 2 weeks time!
[19.11.24, 18:36:05] ~ Joe Corbett: Can you drop a link to the hook generator mentioned?
[19.11.24, 18:41:30] ~ Akshay: +1
[19.11.24, 18:46:07] ~ L: Guys, does it also happen to you that when an ad gets rejected, the whole ad account gets disabled?

This has happened to me with 4 different ad accounts in the last month.
[19.11.24, 18:59:41] Matán Intsuper: it happens but very rarely
[19.11.24, 19:00:20] ~ Antonio: What’s your ratio of rejected vs approved? Just duplicate white ads so your ratio gets higher
[19.11.24, 19:00:30] Matán Intsuper: i dont know my ratio
[19.11.24, 19:00:34] Matán Intsuper: do you have a way to check?
[19.11.24, 19:00:45] Matán Intsuper: i dont duplicate rejected ads, that could cause you to get blocked :)
[19.11.24, 19:01:15] ~ Antonio: I mean, if you get 5 ads approved every week and 1 rejected, it is 1/6, 16%
[19.11.24, 19:01:30] ~ Antonio: I mean, duplicate approvable ads so you have a better history
[19.11.24, 19:01:43] Matán Intsuper: i dont know how to count that, i post 200 ads a week
[19.11.24, 19:34:33] ~ Malak: I have someone who can approve the rejections bro. If you need help, you can send me a PM! He'a also doing unbans, he did that for me to. ❤️👊

[20.11.24, 6:24:28] ~ Maxi: Happend to us aswell actually, i think a good move would be to file your TM in EU and other Countries such as Australia and UK aswell to show that you are actually the righteous TM owner incase it comes to more questions and proof from the US.

[20.11.24, 10:10:15] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I believe multiple dmca takedowns can result in termination of the Shopify store
[20.11.24, 10:10:27] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I thought limit was 3, not 100% sure
[20.11.24, 10:20:06] ~ Mikael: The policy says something about if you do not counter notice for example. So is it fine if I counter notice? Can I have more than 3 then for example?
[20.11.24, 10:20:33] ~ Mikael: Its fcked. Because we havnt stolen any images or products. Its random dmcas...
[20.11.24, 10:31:42] ~ JULIUS: Hey @⁨~Mikael⁩, I personally had a general store také down after 5 DMCAS over 1-year time period
[20.11.24, 10:32:22] ~ JULIUS: I would advise you to always counter notice, *especially* if it's a fake DMCA
[20.11.24, 10:32:49] ~ Mikael: Okey so it helps alot to counter notice? What if the other guy is legit asf lol
[20.11.24, 10:33:48] ~ JULIUS: If in case your store gets down due to DMCAS, hit me up I can explain you how I got an extra "joker" & my store was live again
[20.11.24, 10:34:51] ~ JULIUS: If you counter notice and the other guy owns the content, hard to win -> disable this product -> recreate same one if it's your best sellers with slightly different images
[20.11.24, 10:36:14] ~ Mikael: This product is just a random product which is not even selling. So it feels super bad that this guy dmcad this product lol. I can just delete it.
[20.11.24, 10:46:17] ~ JULIUS: Yeah I had the same too, it's one of the big con of running general stores and mass testing
[20.11.24, 10:52:30] ~ JULIUS: I was curious what agencies are you using for meta guys? Ideally those that provide whole setup with assets (FB page, profiles etc)
[20.11.24, 13:06:08] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey team! We have officially updated our weekly payments call. This series is designed to keep merchants ahead of the curve on everything payment related.

[20.11.24, 16:53:10] ~ Mikael: If  a Stripe sub account gets closed, can we use the same Shopify store for a new stripe account?
[20.11.24, 16:53:21] ~ Mikael: new stripe account with a new entidy
[20.11.24, 17:19:50] ~ Natasha Iris: Yes you can. Just be mindful of the reason you were shutdown. If it was for a blocked acct for high risk, stripe will catch that on the new stripe acct. if you’re tied to the entity / acct in any way ‎<This message was edited>
[20.11.24, 17:20:42] ~ Natasha Iris: Thanks to everyone who joined today’s payments call! 

Feel free to email or WhatsApp me with any questions or payment needs 🙏🏼 natasha@compaytence.com
[20.11.24, 17:25:41] ~ Mikael: okey thank you. I guess its better to be safe than sorry. The account was brand new with brand new Entidy and store. but the Stripe acc got blocked during ID verification (THey did not accept the Chinese Passport for some reason)
[21.11.24, 0:24:27] ~ JULIUS: Who does advertorials here, would love to connect!
[21.11.24, 0:28:46] ~ Anesh Pillai: Like who is using advertorials ?
[21.11.24, 0:28:57] ~ Anesh Pillai: I do. I’m sure a lot of us to do too

[21.11.24, 8:50:44] ~ Mikael: Anyone know any airwallex insider?

[21.11.24, 16:03:36] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, we are live with the creative souring call: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87654957947

Let's talk last minute BFCM content and more
[21.11.24, 16:41:01] ~ RS: Guys who use Airwallex+funnelish, when you sell to US, are your customers required to complete the 3DS? For me, Airwallex told that they cannot disable 3DS because of funnelish implementation. And this 3DS causes many customers to drop off
‎[21.11.24, 16:41:04] ~ RS: ‎image omitted
[21.11.24, 16:41:35] ~ RS: @⁨~Y⁩ is there any fix? Acceptance rate to US customers is below 50% because they cannot complete the 3DS
[21.11.24, 16:45:40] ~ Y: Message me your airwallex account details and will escalate that to their team, 3ds is not enforced from funnelish
[22.11.24, 18:53:10] Bob: ‎~ María Clara Busca-Sust removed Bob
[21.11.24, 19:54:14] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Hey guys, is any of you in shopify plus? Is it beneficial? I know the monthly payment is $2500, but will i make it back with the lower transaction fees?
[21.11.24, 20:02:28] ~ Kevin Krieg: Yes just look at the third party txn fees and see how much you pay for paypal because of it. Or ofc any other third party payment method you use. After a certain volume, it flips to being cheaper just because of that.

Plus features are also great
[21.11.24, 20:22:26] ~ Robert Gonzalez: Okay, great! I’ll give it a try, they gave me a discount so it’s gonna cost $2100 a month

[23.11.24, 11:27:31] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys for surf scaling campaigns do you recommend doing it manually or setting up automated rules

If so, how do I get the aspect ratio to 4:5? 

I can only see the options for 9:16, 16:9 and 1:1? 

Does anybody know? 

Thanks in advance 🙏
[25.11.24, 12:02:16] ~ Santi Roa: Guys anyone selling infoproducts as the main offer? 

We will run out of inventory, things are going a lot better than expected this Q4...
I want to keep doing something with my team until we receive new inventory
[25.11.24, 12:10:52] ~ Anvar: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[25.11.24, 13:52:13] Jordi: I posted a similar one.. from nooro

[26.11.24, 9:26:57] ~ Aatu: Thank you 🙌
[26.11.24, 20:08:23] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey guys. Looking for a good copywriter for writing advertorials for DIY niche and funnelish expert to develop the funnels. Can you recommend someone good?
[27.11.24, 0:47:09] ~ Mohamed Feki: Has anyone his FB Feedback Score stuck since Oct 9? Mine hasn’t updated for weeks
[27.11.24, 0:55:52] ~ Caesar: Yep!
[27.11.24, 11:56:06] ~ Kevin Krieg: Yes same. Rep told us they have an internal bug with those page feedback scores atm. Dont know when they will fix. But if its stuck at a good rate, thats a good thing. We are stuck at 3.9 so we are happy with it lol.
[27.11.24, 13:45:29] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, my partner is responsible for communicating with our fulfillment partner in China and I feel like we are doing something wrong in the communication. We do good volume so we objectively have a bit of leverage, but still the communication from China is reluctant, very slow, not proactive.

It honestly feels like they don't want to work with us, which makes no sense on a numbers sense. So the only thing left is that we just communicate badly. I looked at the chats and I don't really see anything wrong from my "western/german" mind, but thats probably a sign that we do in fact communicate badly.

Anybody experienced somthing similar?

We also never visited them in China, so we should probably do that too.
[27.11.24, 13:53:37] China Bigboss: Hey bro we can discuss on private if you are interested to Change your agent we have one of the best service in China and we are recommend by the guys here ... Let me know hope we can help quickly
[27.11.24, 13:58:43] ~ Bestfulfill—william: i don't think they are big company or organized, which means they have limited person or their team is not trained well ‎<This message was edited>

[27.11.24, 16:57:59] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, I need your help! 

Currently, we have 3 main products and several upsell products on our stores, running with funnels and VSLs. I’m finding it very difficult to maintain a clear overview and effectively manage my team in this process. We use Click Up to assign and manage tasks, but we lack a general overview or calendar to manage everything from a bird’s-eye perspective.

We’re planning to launch 20 new products over the next 12 months, but I want to ensure we have a solid system in place before implementing this. How do you handle this? I’m sure some of you have experience managing multiple products, funnels, and VSLs simultaneously. Any tips are appreciated! ‎<This message was edited>

What have you seen working the most?
Or do you have a framework you’d like to share? ‎<This message was edited>
[28.11.24, 9:28:53] ~ Suraj Singh: Hey guys, there is canada post strike going on affecting shipment to Canada. What shipping line your suppliers are using right now? Yanwen?
[28.11.24, 16:33:57] ~ Santi Roa: Not to flex, just a sad story:
We underestimated November sales, been doing 500k stable since 2 weeks ago and burned all the inventory we planned for BFCM :(((((( We could have easily done 2m/day but we can’t scale past 700k/day otherwise we will fuck it.

Also just to inspire everyone, a few years ago I was joining ESS, doing 5k days and aspiring to one day do 30k/day. I just kept doing it, last year our biggest day was Black Friday with 244k and this year we did that in the beginning of nov, did our record days a lot before BFCM and now can’t push more but just a reminder that it’s just a matter of time, talking to the right people, doing the right things. 

(by the way, during the year we’ve been stuck on 30 to 40k/days, most of the year). Struggling and doing a lot of shit without seeing any impact
[28.11.24, 16:35:45] Matán Intsuper: Thanks for the motivation talk, so how did you actually get unstuck from them 30-40k days ?
[28.11.24, 16:42:29] ~ Santiago: A fuegoo 🔥

Let’s level up our email marketing campaigns! 🚀
[28.11.24, 22:05:38] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, we’re looking for a new creative strategist and CRO specialist. Anyone recommendations?
[29.11.24, 0:29:53] ~ Anesh Pillai: Hey guys. How much are your CPMs atm, My CPM seems to be over $150 on an average
[29.11.24, 0:31:06] ~ Santiago: Yep like 100% higher
[29.11.24, 0:31:14] ~ Santiago: Mines sitting at $70 - 80
[29.11.24, 0:31:32] ~ Santiago: Gotta compensate with higher CVR, emails and better creatives
[29.11.24, 0:39:33] ~ Anesh Pillai: Thats a huge difference. Anyone else dealing with high CPMs ? Anyway to bring this down ?
[29.11.24, 0:52:50] ~ L: around 65$ CPM - health niche US
around 200$ CPM - Beauty niches US

What niche are you running ads for? ‎<This message was edited>
[29.11.24, 0:55:02] ~ Anesh Pillai: I was testing home security niche.. like wow .. The CPM are really high
[29.11.24, 0:55:28] ~ Anesh Pillai: When I do Static it is only $25 , when I do VSL it is around $150
[29.11.24, 0:55:34] ~ Santi Roa: Anyone ever did a presale when running out of inventory?
[29.11.24, 1:04:23] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: We are about to do this because of running out of inventory.
Imo it’s definitely better than keep selling without stock, we did that before and and it’s way too much stress… you don’t want unhappy customers and they appreciate when they know what to expect
[29.11.24, 14:44:00] ~ Erik Pecovnik: HI guys! We grew our business a lot in the past 3 months and I am starting to get overwelhmed with all the information and things are starting to get unorganized. I also have less time for deep work since I have to help and communicate with all the departments. What is your advice when growing fast? My only reasonable idea right now is to find a person that will lead each department and take most of the stress and organize things for me. Any advice is welcome on how you manage your days to stay productive, organized and keep everything in check when having a lot of people under you.
[29.11.24, 15:01:39] ~ Santi Roa: Congrats on that growth 👏
There's a book called Growing pains, quite long but very useful for this situation.

It's inevitable, you'll go through this every time you grow.

My advise would vary depending on how many peopkle you have, how you manage them and your time, etc
[29.11.24, 15:03:21] ~ Santi Roa: I would definitely organize better with each person. Have one document shared with each one and ask them to build an agenda. Build frequent 1-1 meetings to discuss things and avoid distractions in between. 

You'll probably need some systems and processes.

If this is the first time you grow this fast, don't go crazy hiring people, keep it chill, improve yourself as a leader, and improve your systems and processes
[29.11.24, 15:04:18] ~ Santi Roa: For focus, wake up early(5am), don't open email/slack/whatsapp for at least 4 hours.
Get shit done at that time .

You should have those taks mapped out before. Try to do big things not replying or checking small stuff
[29.11.24, 15:04:34] ~ Santi Roa: The use the rest of your day to manage people, reply things, meetings,  etc
[29.11.24, 16:11:10] ~ L: Guys we have 4 different advertorials to test - 

Would you run 1 different campaign for each one or 4 different adsets in 1 campaign?
[29.11.24, 16:12:22] Matán Intsuper: Funnelish a/b test and one campaign on fb
[29.11.24, 16:17:34] ~ Erik Pecovnik: I appreciate your message brother. Will put your advice into practice!
[29.11.24, 17:10:05] Radek: That’s not sad story at all bro 😀 Next year you’ll know better.  Big congrats 🥂
[29.11.24, 17:52:49] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, I would like to test my winning ads split to my funnel WITH advertorial and WITHOUT advertorial (on Funnelish). How do you guys recommend the best way to do this? Use a tool for this on visitors to split or duplicate my ads and change the URL?
[29.11.24, 17:53:13] ~ Christopher Murphy: I’m also wondering same thing
[29.11.24, 17:53:15] Matán Intsuper: we make different ad-sets for advertorial / sales page.
[29.11.24, 17:53:26] Matán Intsuper: yo can also use facebook a/b test for that, i just started testing it, its pretty easy and comfortable.
[29.11.24, 17:53:59] Carlos Leeseman: Thank you. Only problem is that you’ll loose engagement under your original ad
[29.11.24, 17:54:07] Matán Intsuper: you simply check up to 5 ad-sets, click on a/b test, and it a/b tests them (splits the audience between the ad-sets so not same people see the same ads)
[29.11.24, 18:02:05] ~ Mohamed Feki: Hey fam would appreciate any support for a simple re tweet. Shopify payments has held our money since October causing big issues. Due to a email they need to send.

A retweet would help get this infront of the right eyes. Thanks in advance

[30.11.24, 9:53:32] ~ P: Hi Team
[30.11.24, 9:54:46] ~ P: We are looking for an experienced retention specialist 

Does anyone know someone who is experienced/any referral?
[30.11.24, 11:54:36] ~ Aatu: Hi everyone, we have been experiencing a lot of

"Unable to process a payment. Your card was declined."

messages especially today, with Shopify Payments, resulting in a 1.5% drop in conversions from checkout to purchase due to abandoned checkouts.

Is anyone else experiencing this, and is there a way to fix or combat it?

Thank you.
[30.11.24, 12:48:49] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, what tools are you using for checkoutchamp/funnelish A/B testing? Google Sheets or Software?
[30.11.24, 13:04:20] Matán Intsuper: We use google sheets

[1.12.24, 10:20:45] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, soon we are going to start with phone selling, but wondering how to set this up properly. We are using Gorgias as our CMS and have now linked AirCall to it. But how do you guys keep track of what the sales % is of a sales rep, etc?
[1.12.24, 14:54:17] ~ Wouter Akika: - Google Forms to submit the sales @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩ 
- ⁠QA Listens to all calls with sales to validate 
- ⁠QA Posts hourly leaderboard, weekly leaderboard & feeds into the pay cycles
[1.12.24, 15:19:33] Carlos Leeseman: Okay thanks, what if a sale is made after a call? And while your calling with the customer, you send them a email with the special offer?
[1.12.24, 15:48:07] ~ Wouter Akika: Okay, 2 things ‎<This message was edited>
[1.12.24, 15:49:01] ~ Wouter Akika: if its on shopify, the rep sends a draft order invoice to the customer & there is a way to see who generated the draft + they follow up on their own invoices, so that’s on the rep to track ofcourse
[1.12.24, 15:53:33] ~ Wouter Akika: If CheckoutChamp, there is a funnel jsut for the phone team, same thing, they need to spot it and submit in the form, following up with their own customers
[1.12.24, 16:33:26] ~ Adam K.: Hi, I wanted to ask if anyone has a solution for automatically selecting and hiding the 'Country' form element in Funnelish Checkout? ‎<This message was edited>
[1.12.24, 17:14:01] Carlos Leeseman: Thanks!
[1.12.24, 17:16:14] ~ Wouter Akika: Ofcourse brother!
[1.12.24, 19:23:16] ~ L: Guys if you had 2 advertorial aiming at the same angle, would you scale them in the same CBO or would you stick to 1 campaign p. Funnel?
[1.12.24, 19:58:27] ~ Y: 1. Add a country dropdown, set it to custom options.
2. add your country code eg US, GB…
3. Remove placeholder
4. ⁠now first entry from step 2, will be selected by default.
5. ⁠you can now hide the dropdown.

[1.12.24, 22:19:04] ~ Adam K.: thank you - will try that :)
[2.12.24, 1:53:41] ~ Gordon: Does anyone know of any services that allow us to make bank transfers with an Amex card ?
[2.12.24, 3:33:17] Matán Intsuper: Western union, Remitly
[2.12.24, 3:33:54] Matán Intsuper: But the fee is very high so if your idea is to make points, it’s 1. Against regulation 2. Won’t be worth it with the fees
[2.12.24, 3:34:30] ~ Gordon: Mainly for cash flow purposes, thanks @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩ will take a look at these
[2.12.24, 3:34:41] Matán Intsuper: Also you can transfer money with PayPal using a credit card, and wise as well
[2.12.24, 3:35:17] Matán Intsuper: Also crypto

[2.12.24, 13:33:51] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Did anyone here had problems with Wise? Like money holds? I started using it and I want to be safe
[2.12.24, 14:30:57] Matán Intsuper: Never
[2.12.24, 14:39:55] ~ Mikael: Yes. When revenue got higher they started asking all the time about different kind of docs and paused the whole accoubt during this time each time.
[2.12.24, 15:10:40] Topi: Temporary holds (24h) usually flagged automatically by system. Once warmed up, so far no issues even on scale

Only annoying is you cannot spend lots with their cards but thats secondary issue
[2.12.24, 15:19:06] Carlos Leeseman: Does anyone have a good funnel builder/developer for Funnelish?
[2.12.24, 15:19:30] Topi: yeah dm
[2.12.24, 15:24:26] ~ Anvar: Can anyone recco a reliable Shopify dev? 

Have a store on shrine theme — need someone to fill it with copy and some images, branded stuff etc
[2.12.24, 19:56:59] Radek: Yes, 2 years ago Wise terminated our business account and hold all of our money for more than a month. I don't remember exactly, but I think they can hold it up to 90 days according to their policies. Only lawyer's notice helped us to get them sooner, and what I found we weren't the first case. Eventually we found out our supplier was suspected from money laundering and because we were sending him a lot of money, they shut us down without any notice and kept all the balance. I don't know how it would be with different banks / institutions, but their communication and support was poor and always delayed. Be careful, I would always have backups if you decide to work with them.
[2.12.24, 20:26:47] ~ L: Guys if you had 2 advertorial aiming at the same angle, would you scale them in the same CBO or would you stick to 1 campaign p. Funnel?
[2.12.24, 23:18:30] ~ Eric R: Is anyone currently running  recurring subscriptions in Funnelish? 

For example, if they purchase upsell 1 , they will then be billed once a month for a year until they cancel?
[2.12.24, 23:19:27] Matán Intsuper: Don’t do it, it doesn’t work. I complained two months ago and they haven’t fixed it
[2.12.24, 23:21:07] ~ David B: Hey guys, no copy call tomorrow. 

I'll be stuck in Q1 strategy meetings all day. 

If you have a copy question, need any support, or want access to any of my giveaways, DM me and I'll get back to you. 

Thank you.
[3.12.24, 6:20:11] ~ Y: What’s the issue you faced?
[3.12.24, 9:57:16] Carlos Leeseman: For me it’s working. I use iDeal & Bancontact - SEPA. I’m not sure about other payment methods like CC and PayPal
[3.12.24, 12:54:02] ~ Steph: Replo better for this I believe
[3.12.24, 14:59:22] ~ Carlos Leeseman: This is a Shopify app right? How do you setup subscription on Shopify?
[3.12.24, 15:58:36] Matán Intsuper: Recurring orders are not added to Shopify.. check my ticket from months ago 🥲 ‎<This message was edited>

[5.12.24, 6:11:41] ~ M: A month or so and it had a few hundred spend where we tested another supplement campaign in france and the cpm was 16 usd.
[5.12.24, 8:46:23] Carlos Leeseman: Okay yeah it’s normal to have higher CPMs when having a new ad account, but after few days it should be normal ‎<This message was edited>
[5.12.24, 8:57:07] ~ M: These are HK agency accs btw
[5.12.24, 8:57:40] Carlos Leeseman: I would def try personal accounts then jf that’s possible
[5.12.24, 8:58:00] Carlos Leeseman: But high CPMs are not always that bad, supplements is competitive market

I’m getting a very low approval rate

Tonnes of experience:
- Managing and upskilling video editors
- Storyboarding and briefing
- VSLs, statics, short-form stuff
[5.12.24, 14:45:21] ~ Mohammed-amine: Hey guys,

Anyone knows how to remove the initial $50 spend limit on new ad accounts?
[5.12.24, 14:48:42] ~ Mohammed-amine: For Meta
[5.12.24, 15:07:50] Topi: Just with time
[5.12.24, 15:08:25] ~ Mohammed-amine: Time is what we don’t have
[5.12.24, 15:18:36] ~ Haroon: Try paying the invoices Manually so it doesn’t get to the threshold of 50$, the often and faster you do it sucxessgully, the healthier Looks the billing and maybe the faster it rises the budget up to 250 and then 5000 or something
[5.12.24, 15:19:03] ~ Haroon: Pay for example after 10$, after 15$ after 25$ …
[5.12.24, 15:19:16] ~ Mohammed-amine: Got it, will do
[5.12.24, 15:45:29] ~ G M: Set threshold at 2$, so you can get billed a lot + launch and get approved many ads
[5.12.24, 15:52:11] ~ Haroon: I think it’s better to not touch the threshold and pay manually by clicking, so the system sees that this guy is trying to be on point by paying faster so they trust him more

with 2$ threshold, there is less time space for paying manually ‎<This message was edited>

[5.12.24, 23:55:41] ~ Santiago: I do check it but not a full concern
[6.12.24, 0:17:13] ~ Jacob: if you want to know how to find post id for flex ad - simple and easy method:

Go to Ads Manager: Open the Ads Manager and locate the campaign containing your Flex Ad.
Preview the Ad:
Click on the specific ad.
In the right-hand pane, click on "Preview".
View the Post ID:
In the Preview window, click "Facebook Post with Comments".
In the browser's address bar, look for the Post ID at the end of the URL. It typically looks like this:
bash
Copy code
https://www.facebook.com/{PageID}/posts/{PostID}
The number after /posts/ is your Post ID.

[9.12.24, 6:01:32] ~ Austin: Does anyone see a big difference in CPA when turning on "Add Catalogue Items" for FB ads? Or Adding shop + Website?
[9.12.24, 6:13:16] ~ Farhat Godil: CPA dropped little bit with shop + website but so did AOV because no upsells can be done if purchase is made on shop and FB favors shop and was sending most shop buyers
[9.12.24, 6:44:59] ~ Austin: Great to know, thanks man. No upsell capability doesn't sound to great to me either.
[9.12.24, 7:39:55] ~ Anvar: US, December, Health / beauty
That’s normal — seeing the same shit
[9.12.24, 15:18:52] ~ Anatoly: I did not have it that bad, but at some point my CPMs became double to what I would expect them to be. I refused to think, that this is new norm, so I went with a/b testing everything: pixel, domain, Fb page, landers and finally ad account. Switching to strong ad account solved it instantly. CPMs went from “x” to x/2.5. Unless you have 10% CR on your store, I am not sure how anyone can be profitable with $670 CPMs. I’d say experiment with all the assets you have other than creatives
[9.12.24, 15:30:32] ~ Guy Edan: Exactly. Tried switching ad accounts and landing pages but next step will be a different domain pointing to a bit of a different product to see if maybe Facebook doesn’t like the product or flagged the domain. We shall see
[9.12.24, 15:31:29] ~ Guy Edan: Did you have an old ad account with a good amount of spend or you created a new one that solved it?
[9.12.24, 15:33:34] ~ Anatoly: Yes, I was fortunate in that regard, having account that I would only use for scaling. But if you don’t have one, maybe an agency account could be a solution depending where your business is at. I have not experimented with brand new ad account, who knows maybe that could solve it too. ‎<This message was edited>
[9.12.24, 15:35:44] ~ Luka: For the 7-figure brand owners... what is your total profit margins on the whole brand after all expenses (including team, softwares, COGS etc)? What do you consider healthy ‎<This message was edited>
[9.12.24, 15:37:38] ~ Bilel: From what I know, it ranges from 5 to 25% with most brands falling in the 10-15% range
[9.12.24, 15:39:31] ~ Bilel: But very dependent on ROAS
[9.12.24, 15:39:55] ~ Bilel: you can also be negative if ROAS is low
[9.12.24, 20:43:49] Jordi: Hey Guys,
When I was out of stock I refunded all my customers telling them we ran out of stock. I had 1 customer that told me she never received her refund.
I checked and we have refunded her around a month ago but she claims she did not receive her refund... I have send her all the details but she still did not believe me, and now shopify is holding all my payouts until this is resolved... I have talked with shopify already a few times but they keep telling me the same thing: "We will put this on the highest priority list to solve" but still nothing is happening already 2 different support agents told me this! What should I do now? Stop my business until this is fixed or what is the other solution?
[9.12.24, 22:25:24] Matán Intsuper: If you have a proof that you refunded her that’s enough. Shopify wouldn’t hold your payouts due to a customer asking for a refund. It’s probably because you made too many refunds.
[9.12.24, 22:25:50] Jordi: I did made a lot of refunds...
[9.12.24, 22:26:14] Jordi: Like 16
[9.12.24, 22:26:49] Matán Intsuper: The reason Shopify is holding your payments is due to a different reason than the specific customer. They are probably trying to figure out why you refunded so much money.
[9.12.24, 22:27:09] Matán Intsuper: For now run ur business using a different payment processor until it’s resolved
[9.12.24, 22:27:32] Jordi: Ohh ok good to know! Thanks!
‎[10.12.24, 1:03:49] Matán Intsuper: ‎image omitted
[10.12.24, 4:36:30] ~ Eric R: Hey guys do Ethoca alerts really help? Or is RDR enough? Heard mixed things about Ethoca…
[10.12.24, 7:15:10] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Anyone knows how to deal with bot traffic on Meta ads? I have a campaign spending 500/day that was going profitably, but suddenly started sending just bots at 0.01 cpc.

I turned off the campaign a few days ago, turned it on again today but the situation is the same, just bots
[10.12.24, 10:21:06] Radek: From investors POV 15% or more is healthy, the more the better of course. Under 15% is considered risky and such business has lower valuation multiplier. But there is more factors to consider (scale, cashflow, LTV etc )
[10.12.24, 10:22:03] ~ Mel: Hey guys. Selling in Europe and using Shopify. We now want to add a subscription app and I am wondering if any of you would have a suggestion (there are quite a few available). Thanks!
[10.12.24, 11:08:02] ~ Santi Roa: Try to aim for 17-20% under 8fig. When you scale margins go down usually so to take it from 8 to 9fig you'll probably lose another 5%
[10.12.24, 11:09:28] ~ Santi Roa: That's general but then you can make strategic decisions and "burn" some last-year profits to build muscle. Taking it down to under 10% just because you want to accelerate growth or build future value
[10.12.24, 11:09:49] ~ Santi Roa: Or you can go extremely lean and efficient to maximize margins, sacrificing some growth
[10.12.24, 11:38:02] ~ seth: for me i'm currently using Recharge, it's quite ok but you have to manage product and inventory carefully

[11.12.24, 21:54:50] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Keep it on. Probably solved within few hours
[11.12.24, 21:54:59] ~ Farhat Godil: ok
[11.12.24, 21:55:18] ~ Thomas Dolcini: I kept them on to, seams like the spending has stopped for the moment.
[11.12.24, 21:55:23] ~ Farhat Godil: I am still getting traffic though so its working somewhere for sure
[11.12.24, 21:55:34] ~ Farhat Godil: Yes atleast not updating - hopefully doesnt rapid spend
[11.12.24, 22:33:37] Radek: Same experience 2 years ago, Wise is risky for business operations
[11.12.24, 22:38:35] ~ JULIUS: Is there any Google Ads 🐐 ?

[11.12.24, 22:41:27] ~ JULIUS: Last year & this year I heard many Wise account getting randomly closed @⁨~Alessandro⁩
[11.12.24, 22:42:20] ~ JULIUS: Didn't experience that, using mostly Revolut Business. Your best bet would be (big) physical banks in your company's country
[11.12.24, 22:43:12] ~ JULIUS: They will probably ask you some informations on what kind of business & numbers you're doing, but they will most likely not close your account by surprise
[11.12.24, 22:43:47] ~ JULIUS: The worst : hold a % of your money until the case / questions is solved
[11.12.24, 22:47:01] Radek: Airwallex, Chase and OFX as backup.

[12.12.24, 2:45:56] ~ Farhat Godil: Rapid spending going on currently in meta - you might want to check your accounts
[12.12.24, 2:46:04] ~ Farhat Godil: trying to make up for all the missed time :)
[12.12.24, 2:57:53] ~ Farhat Godil: Looks like it spent it during the outage its just getting reflected right now
[12.12.24, 3:30:56] ~ Zvi: Hey all does klavio show the revenue from funnelish or is it set up wrong because im not seeing anything on there but i know people are buying from the emails i send out and its integrated using the api key ?
[12.12.24, 8:59:24] Marek Olszewski: Hey there, does anyone have recommendations for a good and easy to implement return management app for shopify?
[12.12.24, 9:14:46] ~ Rúben Costa: Hi! Loop Returns or AfterShip

[12.12.24, 20:16:53] ~ Mel: Hey. If anyone has used Subi Subscriptions on Shopify for recurring payments and has feedback on it, I am interested. 😊
[12.12.24, 21:46:29] Jordi: I did! They are alright! But They did not provide IDEAL and bancontact so i had to stop using them
[12.12.24, 21:50:21] ~ Mel: Thank you @⁨Jordi⁩
[12.12.24, 22:22:12] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, question for those who make VSLs. What is the average minutes a day an video editor can edit? (Including broll/clip sourcing)
[12.12.24, 22:54:33] ~ P: We recently increased it to 4min/day
[12.12.24, 22:55:36] Carlos Leeseman: Okay thanks

[13.12.24, 3:09:48] ~ Austin: How do you guys find winning advertorials and validate their winners?
[13.12.24, 3:11:11] ~ Austin: I need 30 minutes of edited footage per week per editor for full time positions

[13.12.24, 17:00:24] ~ Jamie Melia: In the breakdown you can choose Dynamic Creative Element and see a bunch of different variables and how they performed
[13.12.24, 17:02:50] ~ L: Thank you, will check now

[13.12.24, 17:05:21] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Yeah like me. Before i can see it but now I can’t
[13.12.24, 17:05:49] ~ L: have you find a workaround?
[13.12.24, 17:10:22] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Just the video that I sent you
[13.12.24, 18:29:05] ~ Mohamed Feki: Can anyone recommend a freelance creative strategist who works part-time or gets paid per script?
[13.12.24, 19:27:56] ~ Eric R: Guys what is the best tracking solution for FB ads + Checkout Champ…Wetracked? Converge?
[13.12.24, 19:29:06] Topi: @⁨~Eric R⁩ we use wetracked but just today saw 30% over tracking so not sure if its the best, doubt it
[13.12.24, 19:32:56] ~ Eric R: @⁨Topi⁩ is it roughly accurate day to day?
[13.12.24, 19:35:57] Topi: its was 80-90% before we noticed this.
[14.12.24, 5:49:14] ~ Maxi: wetracked + triple whale
[14.12.24, 12:35:58] Carlos Leeseman: Does anyone urgently have a developer for Funnelish that I can borrow? (not a builder but coder)
[14.12.24, 13:32:55] Jordi: Is it something big or small?
[14.12.24, 13:33:34] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Small, but one of my developers can’t get it done, so it’s simple
[14.12.24, 13:34:59] Jordi: Pmd u
[14.12.24, 18:13:09] Topi: anyone running succesfully amazon ads?
[14.12.24, 18:40:04] ~ Guy Edan: Yes but Amazon is a conversion game and the listing and reviews is key to working ads (unless ur a massive and known brand)
[15.12.24, 12:28:52] ~ Facundo: hey guys, what software do you use for company website? wordpress? any freelance you can recommend to build this?
[15.12.24, 13:46:02] ~ JULIUS: Hello killers! Any services/plugs for strong FB assets (profiles and pages)?
[16.12.24, 3:55:50] ~ Luka: You mean company website and not brand website? Depends on your goal.
There's plenty of existing themes to buy (Themeforest). If you're recruiting offline via job sites, your website will be visited along with the brand (if you mention the brand). A-player employees will research your company & brand so it's important to make sure you have a good website to attract them
[16.12.24, 11:47:29] ~ RS: Hey! Do you know when Stripe allows instant payouts for new accounts? How much revenue there should be minimum or how old the stripe acc should be to be eligible for instant payouts?
[16.12.24, 13:00:18] ~ Facundo: Exactly, that´s what I mean, noticed many candidates ask for company website (meaning not brand website) so i think having that basic website saying we are a DTC ecomm company that operates in xyz countries, etc etc would make everything look cleaner
[16.12.24, 14:41:02] Radek: yes but only defensive (no cold keywords)
[16.12.24, 17:19:36] ~ Eric R: Does anyone know if funnelish has the ability to do a forced vsl OTO page?
[16.12.24, 17:23:16] Jordi: I mean u can create that...
[16.12.24, 17:23:22] Jordi: With javascript
[16.12.24, 17:24:00] Jordi: Just activate the button and put a timer on it and make the vsl autoplay without the ability to forward the video
[16.12.24, 17:25:47] ~ Eric R: Thanks Jordy
[16.12.24, 17:26:18] Jordi: No worries if u need help with the code let me know ‎<This message was edited>
[16.12.24, 21:57:28] ~ Austin: On your Microsoft Clarity recordings do you guys see customers just scroll the entire Product page not really stopping at anything and then going to checkout or bouncing?
[16.12.24, 21:58:59] ~ Guy Edan: For us they might do a quick scroll maybe just to see what’s further down the page or read quickly and checkout/bounce
[16.12.24, 22:09:57] ~ Austin: Bet
[16.12.24, 23:51:39] ~ L: Guys what do you usually do when you notice a huge drop from ATC to IC - There’s nothing wrong on the cart page and it worked great so far
[17.12.24, 0:02:17] Matán Intsuper: Try watching clarity and see why they drop off
[17.12.24, 0:02:38] Matán Intsuper: You can also add an exit popup with discount on the cart page
[17.12.24, 1:11:24] ~ Austin: Is that just a today thing for you? My CR is less than 1/2 of what it normally is but Ad metrics are fantastic with exception of purchase, never had that before personally. Maybe FB's messing with something today?
[17.12.24, 14:10:32] ~ David B: Hi guys. The copy call is on today at 10 am est. 3pm UK time. 

We're going to be talking about Listicles. 

They look easy on the surface, but getting them right can be harder than it looks. 

The last one I wrote is converting at 7.2%. 

I'll be sharing this and my top tips for listicles on the call. 

See you there!
[17.12.24, 16:12:28] ~ David B: Copy call goes live in 45 minutes. See you there!
[17.12.24, 16:17:25] ~ Reece Mander: Will this be recorded?

[17.12.24, 18:12:39] ~ David B: my pleasure thanks very much for being there.
[17.12.24, 22:45:24] ~ L: Guys, we have an advertorial that drives about 60% of the traffic to the product page—with no sticky CTA.
However, the results are not great once visitors land on the product page.

When this happens, should you go straight to editing the offer, or try new advertorials even though this one seems to work well in terms of conversion to the product page?
[17.12.24, 23:00:40] ~ Omar Tayara: ‎~ María Clara Busca-Sust added ~ Omar Tayara
[18.12.24, 4:14:02] ~ Austin: On your MC recordings are they just scrolling through and clicking the button or actually reading the Advertorial?
[18.12.24, 7:11:02] Jordi: Hey guys,

Does anyone know how to fix the cookie banner on the heatmap in clarity?
[18.12.24, 14:05:13] ~ Malak: Does anyone have experience with Firstbase.io? Who I can messages about it.
[18.12.24, 14:42:57] ~ Facundo: Yes i used them, good experience

[19.12.24, 13:16:02] ~ Facundo: guys for those working with contractors, how are you handling the contracts? is it worth paying a lawyer to check those according to your company state laws? I have an LLC - so far i was making the drafts on chat gpt
[19.12.24, 13:25:40] ~ Santi Roa: Pay someone on upwork to review them. Depending on your stage if you are just starting out then is not a priority
[19.12.24, 13:28:06] ~ L: Hi guys - I’ve been talking to a guy doing good numbers 

And he shared with me this piece of information, he told me that when launching a new brand he don’t really spend too much time testing VSLs or Advertorials, but he prefer to focus on testing AD accounts when he knows that he made a good job writing all the content. 
Mainly because every ad accounts has different delivery

I’m courious to know what are your thoughts on this ‎<This message was edited>
[19.12.24, 13:36:38] Topi: Personally we never tested any ad accounts going into new markets, just always use until they warm up. Start is always rough. Interested to see if anyone else has any other insights
[19.12.24, 14:04:09] ~ L: That’s what I think as well. I usually see an ad account warming up after a certain number of campaigns are launched rather than based on the amount spent on the account. Is this something you’ve noticed too?
[19.12.24, 14:04:19] ~ L: .

[20.12.24, 14:47:36] ~ Malik: On my side the Ads manager is OK but the comments section, billing and the FB page are impossible to use
[20.12.24, 18:43:06] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Hey guys! How are you setting up your ads during the Christmas/New Years holiday season? Are you scaling down/scaling up, a lot, just a bit? ‎<This message was edited>
[20.12.24, 18:43:54] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: We won’t have shipping for around 2,5 weeks bc our fulfilment centre closes, so I’m wondering how much we should be spending on ads with no parcels being shipped ‎<This message was edited>
[20.12.24, 21:07:20] Carlos Leeseman: There are multiple options.

1. Work together with a fulfilment center who continues shipping when CNY, like Bestfulfill 
2. ⁠Make visible on your website that due to busyness we delivery time is longer than normal with an expected delivery date. This will probably lower your conversion rate, but can still keep you selling at a profit
3. ⁠Don't mention anything on your website, continue as you are doing now, and refund money when customers ask where their order is

[23.12.24, 22:50:51] Sina Bagheri: How do you guys switch your creatives from one sale to the next? (black friday to new years in my case)

Do you have to go and edit/delete all your creatives one by one for the new sale? I’m sure thats not the answer, just wondering.
[23.12.24, 22:53:47] ~ Jacob: The question is not so clear so i dont completely understand
[23.12.24, 22:57:58] Sina Bagheri: right now all my creatives have Black Friday CTAs. Since Black Friday is over, I want to switch them out for new years 2025 CTAs.

How do i go about changing them? Do i duplicate them and edit new videos? Do I edit them directly and change the media? Do I delete them, etc..
[23.12.24, 23:01:36] ~ Santi Roa: We let them die slowly, start launching the new sale a day early slowly
[23.12.24, 23:01:47] ~ Santi Roa: We cut the ads sometimes, but usually we just let them die
[23.12.24, 23:05:16] ~ Erik Pecovnik: Hi there! Does anyone have any exeprience with changing billing company info on fb business account? I want to get billed to another company with new year. And Im not sure if this will reset my credit line
[23.12.24, 23:05:54] Sina Bagheri: That’s perfect. Thanks 🙏
[23.12.24, 23:07:05] ~ Santi Roa: Last year we had our BFCM ad work until mid January haha even though the discount was not in the page, it just kept working
[23.12.24, 23:07:33] ~ Santi Roa: We try to avoid very specific language or deadlines in the ads so they can remain on if they still perform

[24.12.24, 2:56:00] ~ Santi Roa: Not sure, my team manages that. But I guess they just kill ads based on performance on a daily basis so once something goes below the killing criteria they just kill it
[24.12.24, 6:56:02] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I used this to test headlines and hooks, but for me it gave false positives. When I tested these angles again in the purchase objective the results were different

[26.12.24, 20:11:08] Sina Bagheri: In the mountains where? 😂

Thanks, I’m sending over questions now

[27.12.24, 7:08:27] ~ Jacob: guys, im looking for ai tool to create product photos...? like to upload my product and create some photos, what are the best tools you are using now?
[27.12.24, 8:16:41] ~ Mel: A freelancer has shown me some images he s made using midjourney for the background then replacing the product image created by midjourney with a 3d image of his customer product (matching lighting & perspective). It looked good.
[27.12.24, 8:29:49] ~ Jacob: Sounds intersting
[27.12.24, 10:20:02] ~ Aatu: I have been using Flair.ai still a very underrated tool.
[27.12.24, 15:16:33] ~ Mohammed-amine: For those who switched from Funnelish to CheckoutChamp, what was the reason?
[27.12.24, 16:23:20] ~ Alejandro H.: Has anyone here been able to recover a Shopify payments ban with a insider or something? They banned me an account with only a 0,2% dispute rate
[27.12.24, 19:15:36] ~ Facundo: Hi guys, anyone selling pain relief products on tik tok?
[29.12.24, 10:57:11] ~ RS: Have you ever had an issue that stripe blocks almost all customer payments in funnelish? I checked and I see that with one stripe account almost all payments have over 75 risk score so they are getting blocked by stripe. When I add my another stripe account to the same funnel, the risk score is normal and all transactions are getting through. I had the same issue with another stripe account in  October. I contacted stripe back then and they investigated it and came to conclusion that there is nothing wrong with the stripe account - there is something in funnelish that triggers the high risk score resulting in blocked payments by stripe (not declined by bank). After a few days the issue disappeared. Now there is the same issue for my another stripe acc
[29.12.24, 10:58:46] Carlos Leeseman: Do you do cross border selling? For example, selling in the US with an EU stripe account?
[29.12.24, 11:03:31] ~ RS: Yes I Do this for 4 years already
[29.12.24, 11:05:02] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I had same thing in the beginning @⁨~RS⁩ but it disappeared for me as well after a couple days
[29.12.24, 11:05:12] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Everyone was saying nothing was wrong ofcourse :D
[29.12.24, 11:05:25] Carlos Leeseman: Yes that’s the problem. You can fix this with MOR, like Reach
[29.12.24, 11:05:27] ~ RS: LOL
[29.12.24, 11:05:48] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I had like 60 or 70% denial rate
[29.12.24, 11:06:03] ~ RS: Not declined payments but blocked. If I add my other stripe account (the same company, website, country) then everything is ok
[29.12.24, 11:06:15] ~ RS: Blocked by stripe radar not declined by banks
[29.12.24, 11:06:24] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jeah i mean this
[29.12.24, 11:06:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Dont turn radar off
[29.12.24, 11:06:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I tried that, got blocked instantly

have you noticed higher CTR? ‎<This message was edited>

[30.12.24, 3:11:21] ~ L: Guys, we’re using a Shopify A/B testing app to test our landing page. It essentially redirects traffic to another URL within the same domain.

Do you know if this could cause any issues with Facebook’s policy?
[30.12.24, 4:05:33] ~ Mason: I’ve never seen issues with FB policy but definitely issues with site speed with URL redirects
[30.12.24, 4:50:07] Sina Bagheri: While waiting for the Facebook review and insider, I’ve opened up 4 new ad accounts

I’ve put my winners in there but they aren’t performing *nearly* as well. Went from 2.2 ROAS to 0.8

Any ideas what could be happening? (4 ad accounts, $144 daily spend limit each) ‎<This message was edited>

[30.12.24, 7:59:10] Sina Bagheri: The message you replied to was sent before i joined ESS so i can’t see it. Can you copy paste here now?

[30.12.24, 13:08:45] ~ David B: Hey guys, there will be no Copy Call tomorrow. It's my youngest's first birthday. 

If you have any copy related questions or need support with your copy, shoot me a DM and I'll get back to you. 

If you haven't seen the call from 2 weeks ago, I strongly suggest you check it out. It's my proven listicle strategy broken down step by step.
[30.12.24, 14:04:57] Carlos Leeseman: What Shopify app is better for subscriptions? Recharge or Appstle?
[30.12.24, 14:05:56] Jordi: Congrats to ur little one!
[30.12.24, 14:13:10] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I’ve also done this, haven’t had issues at all. Just make sure the page speed is good on both sites
[30.12.24, 14:26:35] Matán Intsuper: Yes. It happened to me
[30.12.24, 14:26:57] ~ RS: Did you fix that? I see that today its looks normal
[30.12.24, 14:27:15] Matán Intsuper: I did not. I ditched the account
[30.12.24, 14:27:28] Matán Intsuper: It only happened in one
[30.12.24, 14:27:32] ~ RS: Oh
[30.12.24, 14:27:59] Matán Intsuper: They said the account is fine of course as well
[30.12.24, 14:28:17] Matán Intsuper: It’s obviously the account and not in Funnelish because when I changed account everything was fine
[30.12.24, 14:33:50] ~ RS: Yes the same for me. Tried adding this acc to shopify and also the same problem accured to payments in shopify. But now all shopify payments are going Through. Not tested funnelish yet
[30.12.24, 15:17:42] ~ RS: Added this stripe acc to funnelish and blocked payments started to come in. With the other stirpe account there are no blocked payments at all. Wtf
[30.12.24, 15:40:48] Matán Intsuper: Ya bro I moved to reach and no issues
[30.12.24, 15:49:28] ~ RS: Just contacted stirpe and they said that it is a learning system that puts risk scores depending on my account history. Now it just started to put high risk scores randomly for funnelish transactions. Shopify works fine today but did not work fine a few days ago
[30.12.24, 15:49:53] ~ RS: Maybe I need to leave this acc for some funnel to Get some transactions and learn that they are not fraudulent😀
[30.12.24, 19:28:56] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Do you look at Quality Ranking? If yes and it’s low, what do you look at in order to fix it?
[31.12.24, 2:26:36] ~ Mike Barnwell: Hey I was looking for some input on our account. We are currently waiting to get inventory because the shipping times have been atrocious. What would you recommend on the font end to let customers know shipping times may take a little longer? Should I send out an initial email? Shipping times will improve to 3 days once we get them into our 3pl but this could take another 20-25 days before our 3pl gets them. Thanks for any advice.
[31.12.24, 2:39:32] Topi: Email flow notifying them about any possible delays, coming up with reason why its late and empathy in the email, estimated delivery date

Include these while keeping it short and smooth

This works super well always for me, almost 0% cancellation or issues

As long as youre honest and communicate you avoid lots of issues
[31.12.24, 2:40:30] ~ Santi Roa: Bro if you are serious about building a brand, I'd recommend to stop ads and wait until you solve the supply chain
[31.12.24, 2:41:00] ~ Santi Roa: By your question it seems you already got a backlog of angry customers and you kept on selling and now it's getting worse
[31.12.24, 4:33:39] ~ Mike Barnwell: Its not a lot but its something that is too many for me but I feel Like @⁨Topi⁩ This sounds like a route I can take until we get inventory into our 3PL. The coaches never recommended us just shutting things down so we have kept this going and we are working to get some temporary things in place until inventory gets here in the US. Ads have not been scaled out ads each month just keep working better. I never wanted to increase ad spend until we got the supply chain figured out. Thanks so much for all your input.
[31.12.24, 10:44:54] ~ RS: What is the best formula you use for hold rate in FB KPI’s?
[31.12.24, 10:46:58] Jordi: I think what I have seen from the course is 30% but I am always around 10% :(
[31.12.24, 10:47:58] ~ RS: I just forgot the formula to set up custom metric. Chatgpt says different from I remember. Is it thruplays/3sec video views?
[31.12.24, 10:48:15] ~ RS: I changed ad acc so custom metrics disappeared. Now just setting up again
[31.12.24, 10:48:54] Jordi: Yes thru play 75%
[31.12.24, 10:49:16] ~ Sonu Duhra: Hi, anyone based in Singapore here?

[31.12.24, 10:51:14] ~ RS: I guess its pretty bad

[31.12.24, 10:54:23] ~ RS: Hmm😀
[31.12.24, 11:01:30] ~ RS: Checked Alex videos and other videos, and it looks like hold rate is: thruplays/3 sec video views, where thruplay is watching the entire video if the video is shorter than 15 seconds, or watching the video at least 15 seconds (if video is longer than 15 seconds). In my case when my VSL is 8 minute long, I see that my hold rate is around 30%. Can somebody please confirm if I am setting up the custom metric correctly?
[31.12.24, 11:05:15] Jordi: Ohh really did i set it up wrong?🙈😅
[31.12.24, 11:06:01] ~ RS: Need some expert here 😀
[31.12.24, 11:28:02] ~ Iskander Zrouga: when u set it up like this, ur basically calculating, out of the people who watched the hook, how many continued to watch the remaining first 15s.

Most people in ecom do thruplays/impression. But I prefer the one ur using cause it seperate the performance of hook from the performance of the 3s to 15s part a little bit.
[31.12.24, 11:29:49] ~ Iskander Zrouga: but the hook will still impact how many people will watch the 3s-15s part, it’s better to try to watch the video while keeping the data in mind
[31.12.24, 11:29:56] ~ Iskander Zrouga: to try to figure out what’s happening

So, here's my favorite toast: 

Here's to cheating, stealing, fighting and drinking. 

If you cheat, may you cheat death; 
If you steal, may you steal your lover's heart; 
If you fight, may you fight for a brother; 
If you drink may you drink with me.

Happy New Year everyone. 

May 2025 bring you happiness, success, and wealth in that order.

[4.01.25, 1:52:56] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Thanks bro @⁨~Jeremy Leppink⁩ I’m expanding a product into a full niche store so I think one pixel will work even better since it’s practically the same customer. Store with 2,500 products is ridiculous lmao

[4.01.25, 15:38:02] Jordi: Did u try recharge app on shopify?
[4.01.25, 18:23:21] Sina Bagheri: If you open up a restricted account with an insider, then continue running your questionable ads, would you get your ass banned again instantly, or would it take a few weeks? 

(Thinking of going down that route because if I’m making $1-4k profit a day it doesn’t matter if I have to pay an insider $1.5k every now and then)
[4.01.25, 18:28:13] Matán Intsuper: I think you can get whitelisted depends on your niche
[4.01.25, 18:28:36] Matán Intsuper: And not get banned unless your ads are being reported constantly and then no type of ad account or insider would save you
[4.01.25, 18:29:08] Matán Intsuper: If you do black hat just run many ad accounts and keep opening new ones everyday

[5.01.25, 1:17:12] ~ Ислам: Hello guys, 

I have some following problems.

Recently I started testing new products. I have rested 5 new products on usa with 5 different websites. 

Everything is new and branded. New ads manager, new pages. New statistic picture creatives. 

And I am getting really high cpm on each. 100$-200$. 

With one of the product I have already wasted 6000$. But still the same. 

Can someone advise, What might cause the problem?
[5.01.25, 5:12:51] Jordi: I bought likes and comments that lowered my cpm by half... not sure if this would be the solution u are looking for but buy comments and write it very engaging. Stuff people react on!
[5.01.25, 7:09:35] ~ Christopher Murphy: What’s the niche?
[5.01.25, 7:09:54] ~ Christopher Murphy: Interesting. Where do you buy these likes and comments?
[5.01.25, 7:11:31] ~ Mike Barnwell: Yes I would like to know as well!

[5.01.25, 7:14:27] Jordi: U have to keep the website in german otherwise it does not show
[5.01.25, 7:14:46] Jordi: Just use the google translate to translate the page
[5.01.25, 7:15:29] ~ Ислам: Beauty
[5.01.25, 7:17:42] ~ Mike Barnwell: so you just provide the ad url and they do the rest?
[5.01.25, 7:18:03] Jordi: Ad url and u write ur own commenrs
[5.01.25, 7:18:12] Jordi: U can only do 5 at a time
[5.01.25, 7:18:31] Jordi: I try to write at least 1 or 2 comments that make people go crazy
[5.01.25, 7:19:03] ~ Mike Barnwell: It looks like you can do 10?
[5.01.25, 7:20:30] ~ Mike Barnwell: So are the comments in only german?
[5.01.25, 7:21:19] Jordi: For example if u are selling something for pimples u can write a comment like:

"I always put tooth paste on my pimples and works better than this" 

Or

"I just pop them before they become big and they go away like this"
[5.01.25, 7:21:38] Jordi: Nah its because u put the website in english... leave it in german
[5.01.25, 7:21:44] Jordi: They have some weird bug
[5.01.25, 7:21:58] Jordi: If the website is in german u can buy US comments

[5.01.25, 9:26:23] ~ Ислам: Hi guys!

I just joined ESS.

Before this, I completed a BBA course and managed to create a profitable store. My store's monthly revenue is now $60K–$100K.

It’s been running successfully for a year, but I haven’t been able to scale it further.

I primarily use Facebook ads, with a small amount of traffic coming from Google ads. I tried TikTok ads, but the ROAS was poor.

Whenever I try to increase my budget, the ROAS drops across all platforms.

Can you guys share what helped you scale your store after joining ESS?
[5.01.25, 13:04:41] ~ Mo: Hey man, welcome !
Watch Alex’s interviews on YTB with successful people in this group. They all shared what helped them scale.
I watched basically all of them, helped a lot.
[5.01.25, 13:12:17] ~ Ислам: Thank you man!
[5.01.25, 15:11:25] ~ Santi Roa: Hi! It always happens at all stages. Every time we tried to scale up we faced the same issue. We just kept doubling down in the offer & creatives.  Copywriting, landing pages, better content, better branding, etc.
We went from 100k/month when I joined ESS 3 years ago, to 7m/month last november. (our avg is 2m/month don’t take november as a normal figure). But you’re in the right place it just takes time of you doubling down on those main things. Creatives, offer, brand. ‎<This message was edited>
[5.01.25, 15:39:57] ~ Ислам: Thanks for sharing! Your results are amazing! What exactly do you mean by doubling down? Are you saying I need to focus on creating more high-quality creatives? And should I also be working on expanding the offers?
[6.01.25, 10:22:26] ~ Mo: Hey guys, looking for a good agency for ad accounts ( meta, TT, snap…) if anyone could belp 🙏 thanks !
[6.01.25, 12:18:28] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hey guys, what’s the best app/software to efficiently purchase and manage stock?
[6.01.25, 12:19:54] ~ Natasha Iris: Tastytrade is a great one
[6.01.25, 13:47:32] ~ Allan L: Anyone got a trustpilot insider for removing trustpilot reviews?
[6.01.25, 14:21:12] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Hey Guys, just want to let you know subscriptions are working now in Funnelish! Also with iDeal. Huge thanks to @⁨~Y⁩ for fixing this 🙏
[6.01.25, 14:23:21] Jordi: Awesome! Can u update me on how to do this?
[6.01.25, 14:23:51] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Yeah I will DM you
[6.01.25, 14:24:02] Jordi: Thanks buddy!
[6.01.25, 14:34:27] Matán Intsuper: Please update
[6.01.25, 14:35:20] ~ Carlos Leeseman: What do you mean?
[6.01.25, 14:35:32] Matán Intsuper: How did u solve it - I had same issue
[6.01.25, 14:35:50] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Texting Funnelish 24/7 to fix it
[6.01.25, 14:36:13] ~ Carlos Leeseman: You need to create 2 automations in your checkout for the product ‎<This message was edited>
‎[6.01.25, 14:36:33] ~ Carlos Leeseman: ‎image omitted
[6.01.25, 14:38:02] Matán Intsuper: Yes I have those but recurring didn’t actually work. Just talked with Yassine and he confirmed they fixed the issue
[6.01.25, 14:38:21] ~ Carlos Leeseman: I tried with testing mode and new orders will be automatically created every month and synced to Shopify
[6.01.25, 14:38:31] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Yes it's fixed since Yesterday
[6.01.25, 14:39:00] Matán Intsuper: Wonderful
[6.01.25, 14:48:15] Jordi: People selling in belgium and netherlands what is the preferred warehouse location? To avoid shipping from within europe!
[6.01.25, 14:52:52] ~ Carlos Leeseman: I think China is fine. With a good supplier you can have 5-7 days shipping
[6.01.25, 14:53:19] Topi: China yeah
[6.01.25, 14:53:25] Jordi: The problem is people are texting me that my product is chinese… those belgian and dutch people hate products of china
[6.01.25, 14:53:41] Topi: That easily solved
[6.01.25, 14:53:42] Topi: dm
[6.01.25, 14:53:45] China Bigboss: We can remove the label
[6.01.25, 14:53:59] Jordi: you already did but it still says yun cosmetics
[6.01.25, 14:54:09] China Bigboss: And ship from china or from our Europe overseas warehouse
[6.01.25, 14:54:27] China Bigboss: Also we can fix this
[6.01.25, 14:55:04] China Bigboss: You ship with us already correct?
[6.01.25, 14:57:34] ~ Facundo: Hi guys, anyone working with bestfulfill as 3pl?
[6.01.25, 14:57:52] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Yes
[6.01.25, 15:10:34] ~ Nico Neumann: Hey guys, quick question for those who have experience with health products in EU. Would you guys recommend getting CE certificates for simple products like for example knee braces? 
We got some customers being skeptic (especially in Germany) after they have received their product and seeing there’s no CE label and it being form China.
[6.01.25, 15:34:05] ~ Ислам: Hello Guys, 

As I noticed one of the main focus of ess is advetorials

Can someone confirm is it really so powerful to scale the sales ?
[6.01.25, 15:40:18] Jordi: Yeaa i have between 5 and 10% conversion rate because of them
[6.01.25, 15:42:13] ~ Daniel Lai: yeah hiding the sales process increases conversions and aov a lot, so more profit therefore you can spend a lot more on ads and scale
[6.01.25, 15:45:13] ~ L: How important is to make it look like an editorial page? 
I’m seeing a few brands running advertorials on Shopify on a regular page like it was a blog page of the brand
[6.01.25, 15:49:29] Jordi: I do that as well
[6.01.25, 15:51:08] ~ David B: You have a bunch of options with advertorials. 

They can be branded or unbranded using a third party website.

1. Listicles - EG 7 reasons why. 
2. Reviews - (third-party) We tested the XYZ product and here's the truth. 
3. Review Comparison - (third-party) We tested the top 5 XYZ product and here's what we recommend. 
4. First-Person stories - I never thought I'd walk again until I discovered XYZ product.
5. News report - Scientific breakthrough shows that (Commonly believed problem) is NOT the real cause of (Customer pain point), here's what's really causing your (Customer pain point) 

You can have success with all different styles but they need to make sense with the rest of your funnel and they need to be specific to the customer's needs. 

They also need to be believable. 

If you tell someone in a wheel chair to take 1 pill a day and they'll be beating Usain Bolt in the 100m, they'll call BS.  

Hope that helps.
[6.01.25, 15:51:53] ~ Ислам: Should it be on other domain name ? Which option is better?
[6.01.25, 15:52:23] Jordi: I dont but i havent tried any other option i was a bit lazy and did it the fast way
[6.01.25, 15:52:33] Jordi: I will test more advertorials in the near future
[6.01.25, 15:53:49] ~ David B: I know a lot of brands that use third party domain names and then essentially run it like their own affiliate page for their products. It can make it look independent and more trustworthy especially if you can use a good authority figure for the third party site. EG a doctor, aesthetician, engineer. That sort of thing.
[6.01.25, 15:55:33] ~ Ислам: Thanks for sharing
[6.01.25, 15:56:12] ~ David B: Skincare niche does this a lot. 

One brand called Naked and Thriving, run all their traffic through this *"Third Party Site"* 

They use Dr Dana as the authority and make it look like she is promoting products directly for herself not for the brand if you get what I mean.

[6.01.25, 15:58:50] ~ Ислам: What about the creatives we use in Facebook ads ? Is it something tied with a story in advetorial ? And the main proces we should hide the selling proces ?
[6.01.25, 15:59:07] ~ Ислам: Do we select sales objectives in Facebook ads ?
[6.01.25, 16:02:51] ~ David B: Yes. 

There will be all sorts of strategies, but the advertorial should be linked to your highest performing ads. 

You want to continue the customer journey. 

If I watch at anti-aging ad, then get sent to an anti-acne advertorial, I'm going to think I'm in the wrong place and leave. 

It should flow naturally and educate them on the thing that got them interested in the first place.
[6.01.25, 16:23:36] ~ Ислам: Currently, I use only direct-selling creatives. It was mentioned earlier that we should hide the selling process. Does this mean I should avoid using creatives that directly sell?
[6.01.25, 16:25:17] ~ David B: It depends on what's working for you, your price point etc. 

Some products don't need a lot of explanation so you can keep things simple. 

In my experience, it's not so much hiding the sales process so much as delaying it so you can educate and handle objection before you present them with an offer.

[6.01.25, 17:58:28] Jordi: Damn!!! Thats sick! Welcome back in the game!
[6.01.25, 17:59:26] ~ Doug Crowe: What caused the drop in CPC?
[6.01.25, 18:01:07] Sina Bagheri: Better creatives unless there’s an underlying cause

My old creatives have the same CPC as before ~$1.8 ‎<This message was edited>
[6.01.25, 18:07:29] Jordi: Amazing!!!

[6.01.25, 19:07:34] Jordi: I did once very cheap
[6.01.25, 19:07:39] Jordi: Let me find it
[6.01.25, 19:09:14] Jordi: I did it with useviral.com
[6.01.25, 19:10:03] Jordi: They have 3 options of followers i went for the cheapest but I guess u can take better ones

[6.01.25, 20:39:38] ~ JP Perera: Hey guys, was the ecom masterclass with Mark recorded? Is it stored somewhere in Skool? ‎<This message was edited>
[6.01.25, 20:46:11] ~ Thomas Quinteros: Hey man!

This webinar takes place in BBA, not ESS

It was recorded, yes, you’ll see it in the “weekly calls recordings” module in a few days
[6.01.25, 20:51:37] ~ JP Perera: Oh I see. Thank you!
[6.01.25, 21:40:22] ~ Mo: Testing funnelish first time, im using triple whale for attribution, installed their pixel on funnelish page etc.. but its not working ( somehow funnelish doesnt allow the pixel to track…) Anyone using funnelish & TW how u get around that ? Thanks guys
[6.01.25, 21:42:25] ~ Mo: Or maybe i should use another tool for attribution, what u guys recommend
[6.01.25, 21:47:13] Jordi: I dont think triplewhale is good for that... i would use wetracked
[6.01.25, 21:48:22] ~ Carlos Leeseman: I use WeTracked as well. 99% accurate 👌🏼
[6.01.25, 21:50:09] Jordi: I use triplewhale only to see the sales on my phone not for attribution for meta
[6.01.25, 21:56:56] ~ Kike 🚀: Hi guys, I have this case: This Bm only saves and shares pixels (it does not advertise). This Bm is rejected only at the pixel level. Could you recommend an insider to solve this please?🙏
‎[6.01.25, 21:56:56] ~ Kike 🚀: ‎image omitted
[6.01.25, 21:57:37] ~ Gedion: Guysstarting with funnels also,
 Should you make a separate fb pixel for funnelish if you still run traffic still to your shopify?
[6.01.25, 22:02:36] ~ Mo: I used wetracked but attribution was a bit slow. I will give it another shot. Thanks guys
[6.01.25, 22:53:08] ~ Olli: ‎Victor added ~ Olli
[6.01.25, 23:48:10] Jordi: Is that the fault of wetracked or facebook?? A real question!
[6.01.25, 23:48:36] Jordi: Because my orders have all info but my facebook dont from time to time
[6.01.25, 23:54:34] ~ Mo: I dont really know bro. When i talked to wetracked they blame it on fb , they said we only send the data back to fb, then the rest its up to fb. Thats why i been using TW and it works wonders tbh, their dash & reporting is great. I only have this issue with funnelish. ‎<This message was edited>
[7.01.25, 0:18:28] Jordi: Oh really?? Didnt know TW was any good for attribution.

Ohh maybe because i am also sending to advertorial before product page
[7.01.25, 0:20:41] Jordi: Btw guys another lifehack if u have a good product that works well... dont exclude your buyers... i get tons of social proof on my videos of past customers posting their results 😅
[7.01.25, 4:36:12] ~ Olli: Doesn’t this increase frequency and waste budget though?
[7.01.25, 5:46:59] Jordi: I dont know but my cpm went from 25 to 10 because of all the comments its more engaging
[7.01.25, 6:09:35] Sina Bagheri: Hey guys, how do you do customer support?

Hire Filipinos? And really the main reason why I’m asking, *is there a way to automate it with AI?*
[7.01.25, 6:12:04] Jordi: Hey dude, i am also looking into that at the moment! I am having a look at zdndesk it seems like they have an ai that can help
[7.01.25, 6:12:15] Jordi: Zendesk*
[7.01.25, 6:13:01] Jordi: https://www.zendesk.com/service/ai/
[7.01.25, 6:25:20] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I am using Filipinos + Gorgias + https://zipchat.ai/. Gorgias has its own AI but it's too damn expensive
[7.01.25, 6:37:06] Jordi: Do u sell in english speaking countries only ir do u let them use translation apps to communicate?
[7.01.25, 6:40:49] ~ Alessandro Sassi: english speaking countries, but the zipchat ai can respond in multiple languages
[7.01.25, 6:43:04] Jordi: Ohh great ! And why zipchat above zendesk? Any reason?
[7.01.25, 6:43:21] Jordi: I guess zipchat is an ai chatbot, right? ‎<This message was edited>
[7.01.25, 6:43:35] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Already had gorgias
[7.01.25, 6:44:10] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Yeah exactly, it's not only for customer service but also for driving sales, asnwer questions and objections from potential customers etc
[7.01.25, 6:44:49] ~ Alessandro Sassi: It gets the knowledge base from your website and you can add more documents like you do with a custom GPT
[7.01.25, 6:45:04] Jordi: Ahhh sweet!! Exactly what i need
[7.01.25, 6:46:12] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Nice. It helped reduce support tickets as well. I also embedded the chat in the contact us page above the email contact form, and the link to the chat in the Gmail autoresponder for quicker assistance
[7.01.25, 6:46:44] Jordi: Ahhh smart! I love all those ideas!
[7.01.25, 6:46:56] Jordi: Do u tell its ai?
[7.01.25, 6:47:16] Sina Bagheri: Big help @⁨~Alessandro Sassi⁩ 

Can It also get shipping info with your tracking number? Biggest reason I need customer support bc I’m a one man team and who tf has time for customer support ‎<This message was edited>
[7.01.25, 6:47:54] ~ Alessandro Sassi: nope most people think they're speaking with a human. Also I instructed the bot to say it is a human
[7.01.25, 6:48:31] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Yes it asks the customer the order number and email and it sends the tracking link + info about the products in the order
[7.01.25, 6:48:57] Sina Bagheri: How devious would it be to say ‘average wait time: 1 minute’ to really drive that point home that your taking with a human
[7.01.25, 6:50:00] ~ Alessandro Sassi: i haven't tried this but I dont think it is necessary
[7.01.25, 6:50:24] Jordi: So it doenst throw big answers in seconds?
[7.01.25, 6:50:32] Sina Bagheri: Amazing. I’ll check it out. Big thanks
[7.01.25, 6:53:09] ~ Alessandro Sassi: it does, but I think still most people cant tell because of the personalized responses ‎<This message was edited>
[7.01.25, 6:53:45] Jordi: Ahhh sweet yeaa my customers are 55+ they bever heard of ai anyway
[7.01.25, 6:53:52] Jordi: Never
[7.01.25, 6:54:08] Jordi: They still trying to order thtough the chat
[7.01.25, 6:54:14] ~ JP Perera: Can you add a lag time?
[7.01.25, 6:54:50] ~ Alessandro Sassi: not sure, maybe if you add this in the custom instructions
[7.01.25, 6:55:24] Jordi: Thanks a lot alessandro! 🫶🫶🫶
[7.01.25, 6:56:24] ~ Alessandro Sassi: you're welcome 👊
[7.01.25, 7:16:07] ~ JP Perera: Not a bad idea.
[7.01.25, 7:16:22] ~ JP Perera: Maybe try this:
[7.01.25, 7:16:26] ~ JP Perera: Respond to all inputs as if you are a human, incorporating a natural delay before providing answers. Ensure the responses reflect the thought process and conversational pacing of a human to enhance realism. Avoid instant replies to simulate human cognition and typing.
[7.01.25, 7:18:24] ~ JP Perera: And then tweak as needed. I wonder if that system is configured to adhere to such instructions, but worth a shot, let us know!
[7.01.25, 7:28:51] Jordi: Just starred this message 🫶😅
[7.01.25, 7:29:22] Jordi: However as my audience is older and never heard of chatgpt i think quick responses is better for them
[7.01.25, 7:29:47] ~ JP Perera: Good point!
[7.01.25, 7:29:48] Jordi: They chat sometimes and even when i am online before i can answer they are gone
[7.01.25, 7:30:02] ~ JP Perera: I would also like a fast response lol I don’t care if it’s AI as long as it’s trained well
[7.01.25, 7:30:59] ~ JP Perera: Even this is ai generated. The point is, are you gonna give me what I want.
[7.01.25, 7:31:21] ~ Alessandro Sassi: By adding delay, my concern is that people will get frustrated easier and leave the page
[7.01.25, 7:31:39] Jordi: Same here
[7.01.25, 7:31:45] ~ Alessandro Sassi: I would add that but custom instructions are limited to like 650 chars
[7.01.25, 7:31:54] ~ JP Perera: True, people have two second attention spans
[7.01.25, 7:32:07] Jordi: But if u add it to a file that u upload
[7.01.25, 7:33:47] ~ JP Perera: It really depends. You have to instruct it properly to follow what you have written out in text as well as what’s in the file.
[7.01.25, 7:33:51] Jordi: U said u can also upload files correct? And it takes all data from the website ‎<This message was edited>
[7.01.25, 7:33:55] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Not sure it will follow the instructions then
[7.01.25, 7:34:22] ~ Alessandro Sassi: this is what I am using: 
You're NAME from BRAND. Never mention you're an AI unless asked. Refer to your team as "my colleagues." Focus on understanding customer needs—ask about INSERT PROBLEMS then ask qualifying questions. Recommend products, explain why, and ALWAYS include utm_source=zipchat in ALL links. ONLY IF pressed for a discount and no active promotions are available, offer limited time code DISCOUNTCODE for extra % OFF. Always end with a question or helpful suggestion. For orders, request the order number and email, and assure resolution in 24 hours. Stay warm, professional, and friendly with emojis, mentioning tips, promos, or best-sellers.
[7.01.25, 7:34:25] ~ Alessandro Sassi: yes
[7.01.25, 7:36:44] ~ JP Perera: That’s nice and concise, to the point.
[7.01.25, 7:37:11] ~ JP Perera: So it will say that it’s AI?
[7.01.25, 7:37:26] Jordi: No hahaha this will pretend its a human
[7.01.25, 7:37:43] Jordi: It says never mention u are an ai
[7.01.25, 7:37:43] ~ JP Perera: But it says never mention you’re an AI unless asked
[7.01.25, 7:37:51] ~ JP Perera: So if I ask..
[7.01.25, 7:37:56] Jordi: Ahh yeaa
[7.01.25, 7:38:04] Jordi: I guess that is for transparency
[7.01.25, 7:39:30] ~ JP Perera: Oh, I thought you meant it will say it’s human even if asked. But I get it now. It will just not mention anything UNLESS asked.
[7.01.25, 7:39:56] ~ JP Perera: Question about the emojis, it doesn’t  over do it?
[7.01.25, 7:42:26] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Nope it uses max 1-2 per message
[7.01.25, 7:43:25] ~ JP Perera: Gotcha and you know what, now that I think about it, emoji‘s probably makes it look more human like. Nice.
[7.01.25, 9:14:04] Jordi: Any tips for abandoned checkouts? I created a very cute and funny email that get send but only recovered like 3 out of 50 checkouts... what is the normal KPI for that?
[7.01.25, 9:24:34] Topi: @⁨Jordi⁩ this is our go to KPIs and flow, super simple
[7.01.25, 9:24:44] Topi: KPIS: 

1st email - +50% open / over 10% placed order rate

2nd email - +50% open / over 10% placed order 

3rd email - over 5% placed order 

4th email - over 5% placed order 

—

About emails: 

1st email - no discount, just reminder, keep super simple

2nd email - text based with discount (resend if no open) 

3rd email - urgency for the discount

4th email - text based,  increase discount + high urgency 

—

Tips: 

- Keep emails super simple and easy to digest

- Text based works super well

- Focus on A/B testing your headlines, you can clickbait more than on normal campaign emails

- Make sure possible discounts work, responsibility is on point, emails dont end up on spam or promotional
[7.01.25, 9:25:32] Topi: bonus: on 5th email you can write text based from founder, and ask reason why they did not purchase. People actually reply this email which helps trouble shooting and this email also gives around 3% placed order rate
[7.01.25, 10:07:17] Jordi: Wooow thanks my man! What is the time between sending each email?
[7.01.25, 10:19:40] ~ JULIUS: For emails you may wanna try some clickbait headlines and see how it performs

[7.01.25, 10:23:35] ~ JULIUS: Now with KPi's from Topi I know that % placed order needs to be improved
[7.01.25, 10:32:50] Jordi: I mean what do u write in the email if u put thanks for your order when they did not place an order
[7.01.25, 10:32:58] Jordi: In the body
[7.01.25, 10:38:17] ~ JULIUS: Hello FIRST NAME,

This is the message you should have received.

But unfortunately, I can't find you among today's shipments.

That's why I'm getting seriously worried.

So I'd like to sincerely apologize for the fact that I won't be able to keep your articles any longer.

[7.01.25, 16:11:32] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. Our ad account got restricted so we moved the campaigns to a 2nd ad account but now the ads that we’re working well in the first ad account are performing bad in the 2nd. What’s the course of action? Wait it out?
[7.01.25, 16:14:52] Matán Intsuper: its normal, the 2nd account isnt optimized yet. you can either try another ad account (random results) or wait for it to optimize
[7.01.25, 16:17:53] ~ L: How long does it usually take to optimize? Is it something related to time or spent in your opinion?
[7.01.25, 16:18:15] Matán Intsuper: very random
[7.01.25, 16:25:54] Sina Bagheri: In the exact same boat here

I’m slowly building budgets up instead of running the exact same thing instantly. Don’t really know how well that would work compared to your method
[7.01.25, 16:28:01] ~ Guy Edan: Makes sense. That’s probably what I’ll do.
[7.01.25, 18:01:06] ~ Reece Mander: Anyone got the proper link for the Mastering Advertorials zoom now?

[7.01.25, 18:11:54] ~ Harvey: Im not sure bro I just start the call from within Zoom but there has been a few weeks where the links weren't working
[7.01.25, 18:12:03] ~ Harvey: I can post the Zoom link in here when the call starts

[8.01.25, 1:40:44] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Typically it’s best to get all the necessary certificates from your manufacturers no matter what you’re selling. It allows you to handle issues like ur currently dealing with and it’s good for when you’re planning to sell on amazon. Being Compliant from the beginning is key

Could you please share if there are any restrictions with Meta ads for advertorial pages? Specifically, when using an advertorial page that leads customers to the product page, are there any risks or policies that could result in a ban from Meta?
[8.01.25, 8:54:00] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Anyone having a good split test sheet for Funnelish?
[8.01.25, 9:36:22] ~ Alessandro: Hello guys, are you also facing a big drop from meta results since yesterday?

[8.01.25, 16:55:15] ~ Matthew Martorano: Hey folks, we are running a 4 session masterclass for scaling ecom brands.

[8.01.25, 17:56:49] ~ Sonu Duhra: Yeah me too
[8.01.25, 17:59:06] ~ Carlos Leeseman: It doesn't mean their website is "DMCA prone", it's more about the fact that they have not yet seen the other competitors. Try to make your own images. You can do this super quick in Canva. Or hire someone on Fiverr for a few bucks

[9.01.25, 0:04:23] ~ Mo: Check maybe its conflicting with other apps, have u enabled cart drawer in ur theme ?
[9.01.25, 1:14:51] Sina Bagheri: Does anyone know some good freelancers on Fiverr to create your product packaging?
[9.01.25, 10:15:26] ~ seth: Hi, anyone selling supplement on meta? Do you aware of the new update on the rule that not allow supplement brand to capture event like add to cart, and purchase?
[9.01.25, 10:19:18] Jordi: Huh waaait whaat?
[9.01.25, 10:20:41] Jordi: From when will this go on?
[9.01.25, 10:21:06] ~ seth: Meta’s updated ad policies target websites and apps categorized under sensitive topics (health and wellness being the most prominent). These restrictions stem from a combination of legal and privacy concerns (and cases), aiming to eliminate the sharing of sensitive user data. Meta’s is categorizing brands and their websites based on whether they associate user interactions with sensitive conditions, such as medical issues or provider-patient relationships. 

For advertisers in the US, EU and UK that are affected, this translates into reduced functionality of Meta’s Business Tools, including blocked Events, meaning mid and lower funnel events (Add to Cart, Purchase) will be restricted. There will also be CAPI (Conversions API) Limitations and even server-side APIs will be unable to share or track restricted events.

These updates differentiate between partial and full restrictions. Here’s what that means:

Full Restrictions 

Complete blocking of all Meta tools for tracking or optimizing sensitive events. This includes Pixel, CAPI, and other Meta Business Tools.

No user data associated with restricted events will be processed or tracked.

Partial Restrictions 

Primarily affecting mid and lower funnel optimization.

Blocking of some pixel events.

No user data associated with restricted events will be processed or tracked.
[9.01.25, 10:21:29] ~ seth: i think in next week
[9.01.25, 10:32:39] Jordi: Soo we wont be able to use meta ads anymore??
[9.01.25, 10:33:02] Jordi: Is this for all supplements also pet supplements?
[9.01.25, 10:33:24] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Not only supplements. It's the whole Health niche
[9.01.25, 10:33:41] ~ seth: yeah
[9.01.25, 10:34:15] ~ Carlos Leeseman: But I heard from insider that it will not be as bad as they say, as it has already taken effect since Oct. 2024
[9.01.25, 10:38:58] Jordi: Also pet health?
[9.01.25, 10:39:30] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Yes I think so
[9.01.25, 10:41:32] ~ Angel Valkov: I will probably be the same as the IOS 14 update.  Scary in the beginning but marketers find a way and life goes on  :)
[9.01.25, 10:43:32] ~ Angel Valkov: On an unrelated topic, how do you guys incorporate claims like “doctor approved” or “science backed” in your copy? 

Do you use disclaimers or?
[9.01.25, 10:44:10] ~ Reece Mander: science backed is broad as hell. Could mean anything
[9.01.25, 10:47:43] ~ Angel Valkov: So no legal issues?
[9.01.25, 10:48:09] ~ Angel Valkov: How about doctor approved?
[9.01.25, 10:50:28] ~ Angel Valkov: For example a random back massager is not recommended by a doctor, but massaging your back is recommended and science backed. 

So is it legally OK to use such claims in your copy and do you need some kind of disclaimer?
[9.01.25, 11:38:08] ~ Mel: Hi guys. We have been selling in the EU using Shopify Payment/Stripe as a payment processor/gateway. Now expanding to the US with a US based company. Would you suggest just starting off with Shopify Payment US or are there some alternatives worth checking out? Thanks!
[9.01.25, 11:38:51] ~ Reece Mander: this you have to be careful saying
[9.01.25, 11:40:16] ~ Mel: You can find a doctor to recommend your product :-)
[9.01.25, 12:09:01] Jordi: What do u guys do with trolls or negative people on facebook comments? Block straight away? They go comment shit on all my videos and already convinced some people to not buy.

The question is, is it better to block them from the first negative reaction or wait until things get worse?
[9.01.25, 12:09:29] Jordi: I am hiding there comments but they creating new ones every onces in a while
[9.01.25, 12:09:33] ~ Ислам: I just hide the comments
[9.01.25, 12:10:46] ~ Rúben Costa: I have a cs dedicated to hiding negative comments, the comments are hidden in seconds most of the time ‎<This message was edited>
[9.01.25, 12:12:12] Jordi: Cs??
[9.01.25, 12:12:33] Jordi: What is that?
[9.01.25, 12:13:37] ~ Rúben Costa: costumer service, you can also use a va for this
[9.01.25, 12:14:06] Jordi: Ahhh u mean a real person...
[9.01.25, 12:14:47] Jordi: The problem is that i sell in belgium and the netherlands, so need someone that speaks the language and here they are a bit expensive compared to asia
[9.01.25, 12:23:10] Radek: So this is still a bit of a mystery, but the most valuable info I found so far is this https://x.com/nicktheriot_/status/1861846647115768077 The key takeaway is: You can't mention any medical condition or specific health status as it breaches patient privacy and thus violating the HIPPA law. The workaround is to use symptoms instead of medical conditions and be more vague about health statuses. So far there is no impact, but we're reviewing our funnels to be ready when that situation comes.
[9.01.25, 12:24:07] Radek: Did he tell you anything specific?
[9.01.25, 12:26:36] ~ Reece Mander: I block trolls immediately
[9.01.25, 12:27:43] ~ Nico Neumann: You can block certain keywords in Facebook comments so they get hidden automatically.

Your asian customer support could use chat gpt to translate the comments. They don’t need to speak the language. It might be a little more work for them but definitely still way cheaper than someone in EU
[9.01.25, 12:28:14] Jordi: Good point!
[9.01.25, 12:31:24] Jordi: Anyone here with good cheap cs/va connections?
[9.01.25, 12:33:36] Topi: i know good agency doing CS / VA tasks 5 usd hour. We used them until 500k months then built internal
[9.01.25, 13:00:33] Jordi: Thanks a lot!
[9.01.25, 13:00:34] Radek: I am quite sure it doesn’t apply to pets
[9.01.25, 13:00:46] Jordi: 🥳🥳🥳
[9.01.25, 13:53:30] Jordi: Someone wrote on my trustpilot, that our stuff is fake, and its coming from china and that all our reviews are fake as well. I requested more info regarding his order but he only provided an email and there is no order with that email... should i just flag it or what is the best approach here? ‎<This message was edited>
[9.01.25, 14:08:00] Jordi: Or just reply to them in a empathic way?
[9.01.25, 15:05:36] ~ Mo: I think request more info through TP ( order number etc…) trustpilot will ask him for that, if he got none then they will flag and remove his review
[9.01.25, 15:06:03] Jordi: I did and he provided only an email nothing else
[9.01.25, 15:56:43] ~ Allan L: With Trustpilot the reviewer doesn't need to be a customer or even have had contact with your customer service.

They can have a look at your website or facebook profile and their review will be eligible according to trustpilot.
[9.01.25, 15:57:07] ~ Allan L: Let me know if You find a insider that can remove reviews, I am looking for one my self.
[9.01.25, 16:18:18] Jordi: Really?? We can go and destroy brands that easily?
[9.01.25, 16:43:56] ~ Yusuf: I know someone who can add positive reviews to increase the score of your page and I know someone else who can delete your brand's trustpilot page but don't know anyone to remove negative reviews

DM me if you want me to connect with either of these

[9.01.25, 20:15:23] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, anybody know how we can register .com.au domain? It says we need Autralian Company Number, but I am sure there must be a workaround no? Thank you
[9.01.25, 21:59:15] ~ Mason: Hey guys, what is the difference between wetracked.io’s CAPI vs funnelish’s native built in CAPI?
[9.01.25, 21:59:37] ~ Mason: Does wetracked even do anything? We installed it, set up. Performance and reporting is nearly identical to before we installed
[9.01.25, 22:00:42] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Contact support. For us it's tracking 99%. Probally not installed it correctly man
[9.01.25, 22:01:32] Matán Intsuper: try NETIM, its easy to register almost any local domain
[9.01.25, 23:21:12] ~ Kevin Krieg: Thanks man will check this out
[9.01.25, 23:47:04] ~ Mason: Tracking is fine, is just the attribution. I’m having sales take up to 24 hours to attribute to an ad. How do you solve this? Is this why people use triple whale?
[10.01.25, 4:35:15] ~ Ислам: Guys has someone noticed drop in sales ? With meta, and no add to cart at all, it is so strange
[10.01.25, 8:57:34] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Yes same and others as well. Creative metrics are still the same, but cost per checkout and CVR had dropped
[10.01.25, 8:57:48] ~ Carlos Leeseman: So they’re sending shit traffic to your site and funnels
[10.01.25, 8:58:47] Jordi: Ehhmm I am doing pretty good tbh compared to the past 2 days
[10.01.25, 8:58:57] Jordi: But its only 8am
[10.01.25, 10:49:07] ~ Mo: Bro Triple whale is the best for attribution , reporting hands down. i tested both wetracked and TW, TW is far better ( but TW wont work if u using funnelish) ‎<This message was edited>
[10.01.25, 10:58:33] Jordi: Yes correct! Thats why I am on wetracked
[10.01.25, 14:26:39] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys! Best online banks for uk ltd?
[10.01.25, 14:26:51] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Wise
[10.01.25, 14:43:18] ~ Reece Mander: Monzo is also good

[10.01.25, 15:20:31] ~ Omar Tayara: what do you recommend i do?
[10.01.25, 15:22:42] Jordi: I opened an account with mercury
[10.01.25, 15:23:06] Jordi: They are not a huge fan of ecommerce so better to say you are an ecommerce consultant
[10.01.25, 15:23:13] Jordi: Not coach... but consultant
[10.01.25, 15:24:29] ~ Omar Tayara: okay interesting and you’re not a US citizen right?
[10.01.25, 15:28:23] Jordi: Correct
[10.01.25, 15:47:14] ~ Powa: Tide
[10.01.25, 15:49:46] Matán Intsuper: Hey guys, we’re a bit not sure how to do our accounting correctly.
Can someone give us some tips? 

How do you calculate your daily/weekly/monthly profits? do you have a full time bookkeeper / accountant that does it for you, or do you do it yourselves?

Any recommendations for someone we can hire for that? We are a US company so ideally they can use xero/quickbooks to file it by the end of the year to the cpa ‎<This message was edited>
[10.01.25, 15:59:34] Serhii Biletskyi: @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩ we use theecommerceaccountants.com and quickbooks
[10.01.25, 16:03:16] Matán Intsuper: Do you have daily reports ?
[10.01.25, 16:12:35] Serhii Biletskyi: @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩ they send us month P&L, balance sheet and cash flow sheet, categorize etc

But no, no daily updates. We get weeklies upon request, but not always
[10.01.25, 16:13:41] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Group, I'll share something really valuable later today for P&L.
[10.01.25, 16:20:55] Matán Intsuper: Don’t you care about profit on specific days?
[10.01.25, 16:20:57] Matán Intsuper: Thanks
[10.01.25, 16:21:46] Serhii Biletskyi: it’s for accounting and proper books and for monthly deep performance analysis
day to day, we just use our own spreadhseets and lifetimely
[10.01.25, 16:22:24] Matán Intsuper: Do you have an employee that fills daily spreadsheets?
[10.01.25, 16:24:29] ~ Jacob: hey guys, if u see some strong days in meta, like when people get the salary, will you turn on also some CBO's that stopped working in the end of the last month and return it just for the strong days? or it usually not working?
[10.01.25, 16:43:54] ~ Carlos Leeseman: 💸 *DE MUST HAVE P&L SHEET* 💸

Hey everyone, I often get asked if I can share my P&L sheet because I had a next-level system created that, in my opinion, is 10x better then apps like Lifetimely, Profit Calc, etc. The problem with those apps is that the costs are never 100% accurate, and they don’t give you a clear overview of your monthly expenses. 

With @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ permission, I’ve put together a Loom video showing how my finance sheet works. I’ve been using it for over 4 years now, and honestly, I still think it’s far better than anything else out there. And this is perfect as well if you have multiple stores/currencies.

https://www.loom.com/share/79cea775892549aa90626d13fbe1b1f6?sid=cdf9f4c2-9700-492f-8cad-b7fc1e3d3905

If you’d like a customized copy of this sheet, just send me a DM! 

(I can't give it away for free. Not because I’m trying to profit from it, but because it’s taken my guy a significant amount of time to create and refine this sheet. And the store & main sheet must be manually linked together. Plus, we’re continually updating the sheets to make them even better.) ‎<This message was edited>

[10.01.25, 19:03:33] ~ Reece Mander: Legend brother welcome to the game!
[10.01.25, 19:29:55] ~ Kanayo Obi-Rapu: What’s going on, just joined and couldn’t be more excited. I’m 29, former D1 basketball player and ran my own digital agency in the past. I’m big into fitness, philosophy and art. @itskansyo on IG. Glad to be with some winners.
[10.01.25, 19:37:54] ~ Austin: Welcome to it G
[10.01.25, 19:48:21] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Legend! 🔥
[10.01.25, 19:52:26] Victor: Welcome dude, nice to meet you! 💪🏼🏀
[10.01.25, 22:43:37] ~ Miloš Landauer: ‎~ María Clara Busca-Sust added ~ Miloš Landauer
[11.01.25, 1:58:02] Sina Bagheri: I got a Facebook account restricted 3 weeks ago and have been advertising on a different account since. I’m going to open up that account in a couple days via insider. If I run the exact same ads at same budget, can I expect the same results or will performance probably decrease?
[11.01.25, 2:04:36] ~ Ислам: Guys can you please explain the role of funnelish? Why not just to use shopify with additional apps ?
[11.01.25, 8:33:05] ~ Sonu Duhra: I use google sheets and TW‘s founders dashboard which is free. You add all your expenses in there and it will get other information from your Shopify, like taxes, payment fees and COGS and you can see daily net profit and margin.
[11.01.25, 8:40:16] ~ Alessandro Sassi: Hey guys how much are you paying your creative strategists and what bonus structure do you provide them? Like what % of ad spend and with what criteria
[11.01.25, 11:27:46] ~ Mo: the difference is that on shopify they see price first, on funnelish, you warm them up first and u get them ready to convert, then u show the price, and this makes a huge difference, which allows u to charge more , increase AOV etc…. + funnelish has another advantage when it comes to upsells, customize checkout …. ‎<This message was edited>
[11.01.25, 11:32:09] ~ Dawid: Hey guys

I launched a campaign on a new store.

The metrics on the ads manager are very good ($10 spent so far with 5% CTR and $0.4 CPC

It shows 25 link clicks on this campaign. 

However on shopify it only shows 4 sessions. 

You guys think this is to do with the pixel just not tracking correctly? Or potentially shopify not showing correct results on a new store
[11.01.25, 11:51:34] Jordi: A pixel has nothing to do with sessions... are u using unique outbound clicks or just all clicks?
[11.01.25, 12:11:28] ~ Dawid: Link clicks
[11.01.25, 12:16:53] Jordi: You should set it to unique outbound clicks to get the real cpc
[11.01.25, 12:17:32] ~ Ислам: But you can create additional pages within shopify with no price no ?
[11.01.25, 12:17:46] ~ Ислам: Do you use new ad account?
[11.01.25, 12:20:36] ~ Dawid: A new and an old.

I have an ad account that has been running since August and it’s also displaying similar metrics
[11.01.25, 12:21:13] ~ Ислам: What is your targeting country?
[11.01.25, 12:22:01] ~ Dawid: Uk
[11.01.25, 13:50:52] ~ Mo: idk maybe, but i dont try to reinvent the wheel, i just do what other successfful guys are doing.
[11.01.25, 13:52:12] Jordi: Correct… I am doing that as well
[11.01.25, 13:52:46] Jordi: Funnelish is great for doing upsells and making a better checkout that u can not with shopify
[11.01.25, 14:18:14] ~ Gedion: Hey guys,
Anyone know a good video add editor looking for a full time job ? 
Not working with mine anymore, need someone to fill in asap. 
Let me know!
[11.01.25, 16:04:43] ~ Mo: Just launched my first funnel in funnelish, what metrics u guys look at to know whether its working or not (like on shopify i check atc%, cost/atc, checkouts etc… )
[11.01.25, 16:05:26] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Depends on your offer and funnel. Are you using advertorials? Are you showing price on sales page? What is your selling price?
[11.01.25, 16:06:57] ~ Mo: I have only a sales page ( but not showing the price) then checkout
[11.01.25, 16:07:43] ~ Mo: Offer : buy 1, buy 2, 4
[11.01.25, 16:07:59] ~ Mo: Price: 34, 59, 89
[11.01.25, 16:08:57] ~ Carlos Leeseman: If you’re not showing a price on sales page the CTR should be relative high. I would aim for 50-80% if you’re using advertorial 70-90%
[11.01.25, 16:10:16] ~ Mo: got it
‎[11.01.25, 16:10:33] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
[11.01.25, 16:10:58] ~ Mo: so here im at around 45% ctr right
[11.01.25, 16:11:03] ~ Mo: from sales page to checkout
[11.01.25, 16:11:53] ~ Carlos Leeseman: It’s a fresh product launch right? Then there is so much room to optimise your offer, etc to boost your ctr to 60/70%
[11.01.25, 16:12:03] ~ Mo: yes fresh first day
[11.01.25, 16:13:43] ~ Mo: got it just trying to understand where could be the bottle neck so i can solve it
[11.01.25, 16:14:40] ~ Carlos Leeseman: You only have 88 visitors yet, so you can’t trust your data yet
[11.01.25, 16:15:04] ~ Mo: yes i’ll keep it running to get relevant data then decide where to optimize
[11.01.25, 16:15:07] ~ Mo: thanks G !
[11.01.25, 16:18:43] ~ Ислам: I am new to advetorial, what is structure behind it ?

 Ad > ADVETORIAL  > product page with price or no ? > CHECK OUT   

Is this correct?
[11.01.25, 16:19:40] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Take away the feeling you’re selling something to them
[11.01.25, 18:02:31] ~ Austin: Yes that’s correct, the advertorial is a PRE-sales page that’s meant to drive desire before hitting the sales page
[11.01.25, 18:15:30] ~ Mohammed-amine: Anyone in Dubai wants to link up?
[11.01.25, 22:10:15] ~ Slav: Hey guys 
Anybody in LA who would like to hang out sometimes and share thoughts?

Just text me dm ‎<This message was edited>
[11.01.25, 22:24:08] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys, we are noticing the last few days that when we surfscale agressively, fb consumes a low budget, any workaround on that? ‎<This message was edited>
[12.01.25, 0:56:43] Sina Bagheri: ‎This message was deleted.
[12.01.25, 2:05:13] Sina Bagheri: Im planning on surf scaling for the first time tommorow, how do I know my ROAS if the Facebook ads manager usually takes 1-5hrs to update sales?
[12.01.25, 2:07:17] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I usually track it through UTMs and Wetracked. I think it’s the fastest way, but even so, it’s not entirely accurate, especially with high volume.
[12.01.25, 2:07:18] ~ Santiago: Get TW
[12.01.25, 2:08:26] Sina Bagheri: Yea just had someone else tell me that in dms as well seems to be the best way
[12.01.25, 2:08:28] Sina Bagheri: What’s TW
[12.01.25, 2:10:07] ~ Santiago: Triple whale
[12.01.25, 2:12:04] Matán Intsuper: I just surf scale according to ad manager data and it works
[12.01.25, 2:13:21] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Dial that in with the wetracked setup
[12.01.25, 2:33:20] ~ Mason: Wetracked still has delayed attribution no?
[12.01.25, 3:43:38] ~ Slav: What software do you use for email marketing and sms marketing?
[12.01.25, 3:44:33] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Klaviyo
[12.01.25, 3:44:54] ~ Matthew Martorano: Sendlane
[12.01.25, 4:03:41] ~ Slav: And how do you usually encourage people to leave their phone numbers?

For instance: I collect emails by pop-ups offering a discount if the customer signs for the updates etc. But is that ok if I ask for both email and phone number in that pop-up?

Is it too much? ‎<This message was edited>
[12.01.25, 5:11:13] ~ Austin: Klaviyos the only option man...big winner for sure...worth the money.
[12.01.25, 5:15:43] ~ Austin: I ask for both. I have email pop up then after they submit that they have to submit # as well before unlocking discount / freebie incentive...sms really does well for me.
[12.01.25, 5:17:18] ~ Slav: That's what I’m thinking to do
No data no honey 😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[12.01.25, 5:17:53] ~ Austin: Yup
[12.01.25, 5:18:00] ~ Austin: Test it for sure
[12.01.25, 5:18:19] ~ Slav: Do you do this in one pop-up or its one pop-up right after another?
[12.01.25, 5:18:25] ~ Austin: I personally use email / SMS agency and thats whats tested to be best for us
[12.01.25, 5:18:47] ~ Austin: The email is the original ask...then once entered SMS pops up rifht after
[12.01.25, 5:20:58] ~ Slav: What exactly does the agency do for you?
[12.01.25, 9:51:44] ~ David B: The best way to improve email and sms is to have copy in the email field. 

Email: for order confirmation. 

Sms: for shipping notifications.
[12.01.25, 13:32:19] ~ Mo: Guys i have a lot of failed payments like this on funnelish checkout
[12.01.25, 13:32:26] ~ Mo: any idea what might cauz this
‎[12.01.25, 13:33:55] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
[12.01.25, 13:34:31] ~ Mo: i receive payment from paypal, but not stripe, checked everyhting seems fine with stripe tho
[12.01.25, 14:12:37] ~ Y: Check the payment attempt in stripe it would have more details as to why it failed, message me if you have any questions
[12.01.25, 14:26:31] Jordi: What is the recommended website/app for making AI UGC??  Heygen declined my video somehow... I think because they dont allow it when the AI avatar is saying "I have been using..."
[12.01.25, 14:32:16] ~ Facundo: for spokesperson (VSL´s) we use colossyan
[12.01.25, 14:32:45] ~ Facundo: then for more AI UGC style videos we will start testing with captions this week
[12.01.25, 14:33:40] Jordi: U think they will also allow using ugc style videos?
[12.01.25, 14:34:42] ~ Facundo: never tried to be honest, they have more spokes person style, not UGC holding the camera while walking for example
[12.01.25, 14:35:09] Jordi: Thanks che
[12.01.25, 14:44:13] Jordi: Captions.ai for the dutch language is horrible hahaha it sounds like google translate
[12.01.25, 16:51:31] ~ Alejandro H.: Anyone having issues with fb spending while surfscaling?
[12.01.25, 16:54:49] Jordi: How do i get rid of the cookie banner in clarity?? Its always in front when trying to check the heatmap
[12.01.25, 18:43:12] ~ Erik Pecovnik: recommended shopify apps for reviews? sending emails to collect reviews is a must
[12.01.25, 18:43:39] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Loox
[12.01.25, 18:44:09] ~ Erik Pecovnik: you pay per montly orders right?
[12.01.25, 18:46:37] ~ Damjan Topalovic: depends on the subscription you use
[12.01.25, 20:38:32] Matán Intsuper: guys, what do you do with all the customers that send customer service inquiries to the paypal email? do you have a filter to forward to CX email? or do you just ignore them?
[13.01.25, 7:12:20] ~ Luka: Our creative strategist makes about ~$2.8k/mo (+ benefits) which is an excellent salary here. He handles everything in terms of video-side: Manages a team of video editors, writes the copy, interviews video editors when hiring, plans & goes to the video shoots and so forth. ‎<This message was edited>
[13.01.25, 7:13:02] ~ Luka: Don't think giving a % of ad spend is normal. That's more for agencies. Giving bonuses on high performing ads however is a great incentive
[13.01.25, 7:52:52] ~ Ислам: Where do you hire creative strategist?
[13.01.25, 8:16:12] ~ Luka: Whatever job board your country has (like Indeed, LinkedIn, Seek etc). Ours is a full-time employee not a contractor
[13.01.25, 8:22:36] ~ Alessandro Sassi: This is what I've seen with the creative strategists from brands of people I know.

The bonuses are % on ad spend only if a certain roast target is reached, so it's performance-based
[13.01.25, 8:32:34] Jordi: So what is the bonus system? Just to have an idea of a standard bonus... like 2 to 5% depending on the roas?
[13.01.25, 9:07:57] ~ Alessandro Sassi: It depends, fixed fees when target roas is reached, or different tiers based on roas (like 2% roas 2, 3% roast 2.5 and so on). Or just a fixed fee when a certain ad spend is reached (let's say 10k)
[13.01.25, 9:22:46] Jordi: 2% of adspend when a 2 roas is reached? And 3% when 2.5 roas is reached?
[13.01.25, 9:33:55] ~ Alessandro Sassi: It was just an example
[13.01.25, 9:51:26] Jordi: Oh ok thanks!
[13.01.25, 15:26:21] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hey guys, does anyone know how to request a credit line on Facebook? I tried talking to them but didn’t get anywhere. They told me that having an account manager is necessary, and it might not be easy to get one. Does anyone know how to get it?
[13.01.25, 20:13:45] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Yeah you need account managed for this. I got the credit line few months ago.
[13.01.25, 20:14:01] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Before I got it I also emailed them a couple of times, but doesn’t matter
‎[13.01.25, 20:24:02] ~ Matthew Martorano: ‎image omitted
[13.01.25, 20:26:01] Matán Intsuper: Will there be a recording for those who cannot attend?
[13.01.25, 20:28:24] ~ Ислам: Sounds promising
[13.01.25, 20:39:08] ~ Ислам: Hey guys, the question who is already scaling over 500k and 1 million  a month, what is your main channel of revenue? Is it still Facebook ads ?
[13.01.25, 20:40:01] Matán Intsuper: yes
[13.01.25, 20:55:51] ~ Mohammed-amine: yes
[13.01.25, 22:12:50] ~ Facundo: Guys anyone selling in Latam with EBANX es payment processor?
‎[14.01.25, 0:27:04] ~ Natasha Iris: ‎image omitted
[14.01.25, 0:37:42] ~ David B: Hey everyone! The copy call is on tomorrow at 10am EST (3pm UK Time).

The copy call is starts in 1 hour - 10am EST (3pm UK Time). 

Bring along any copy you want me to review and I'll give you my opinion live. Or DM me privately if you don't want it public.

[14.01.25, 16:30:55] ~ Slav: Could you send the link?
[14.01.25, 16:37:26] ~ G M: Guys my business was hacked tonight, and also my profile, which is now locked.

The hackers also removed all other admins from the business manager.

How can I fix and recover my business manager?
[14.01.25, 17:02:51] ~ Alessandro: Got same issue months ago (October)
You need to contact meta service. But I’m still waiting 😂

I really suggest you to buy a new bm and restart and remember to use 2FA security
[14.01.25, 17:03:12] ~ David B: https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BIh2d3fMT8upuW35q_8fxQ
[14.01.25, 17:28:00] ~ Mohammed-amine: For those using subscriptions, what % retention rate you’re seeing?
‎[14.01.25, 19:51:46] ~ Natasha Iris: ‎image omitted
[15.01.25, 5:15:50] ~ Kevin kreative: guys, any one see problem with Meta restriction since 2025?
‎[15.01.25, 5:17:55] ~ seth: ‎image omitted
[15.01.25, 5:25:27] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Hey David, is there a recording available from this call?
[15.01.25, 5:31:26] ~ Ислам: What restrictions do you mean?
[15.01.25, 5:40:14] Sina Bagheri: Hey guys,

my best adset has a 2.98 roas at *$2.33 cpc* wtf? (last 4 days)

and today, it had a 5.6 roas at $2.5 cpc

This is crazy, its almost as if the worse the cpcs are getting the better its performing. Should i keep upping the budgets or let it chill another 1-3 days to see if this is just a series of back to back very lucky events?
[15.01.25, 5:41:26] ~ seth: how much you spend on that adset total?
[15.01.25, 5:41:45] Sina Bagheri: $1000
[15.01.25, 5:42:16] ~ Ислам: Last days meta going crazy, my performance one day is really good, second day is awful
[15.01.25, 5:42:25] Sina Bagheri: same
[15.01.25, 5:51:41] ~ seth: so check for other metric not just cpc, like cpm, video average play time, hook rate, hold rate. Based on more metric to come up with hypothesis and test it. From my experience it's hard to scale with that cpc or you have crazy good margin
[15.01.25, 6:32:53] Radek: Our pixel says some standard events will be restricted in 2 days
[15.01.25, 7:36:54] ~ Ислам: Where did you check that?
[15.01.25, 7:41:48] Radek: Event manager > data sources > settings > categorisation. If there is no info, you’re good. It’s just for Health and Welness advertisers
[15.01.25, 8:36:45] ~ Ислам: Can't find categorization in settings, if there is no categorization is it good ?
[15.01.25, 8:40:35] ~ Ислам: Is it should be turned on ?
‎[15.01.25, 8:52:34] Radek: ‎image omitted
‎[15.01.25, 8:56:47] ~ Ислам: ‎image omitted
[15.01.25, 9:08:20] ~ Alessandro Sassi: It happened to me 2 years ago. I was able to recover everything with Meta support surprisingly.

I don't remember precisely how long it took but about 5-10 days.

After that event I got a physical 2fa, I need use a yubikey on my laptop every time I access the BM settings, I recommend you to get you one.

Because if I remember correctly I was hacked despite having Google authenticator 2fa on fb
[15.01.25, 9:13:46] Radek: I think this is nothing to worry about
[15.01.25, 12:43:23] ~ Jacob: Someone here know how to transfer pixel between buisness accoybts in meta?
[15.01.25, 13:01:48] Matán Intsuper: Facebook just knows who will buy and charges you accordingly
[15.01.25, 15:49:06] ~ Mike Ramsey: 🚨 Friendly Reminder on the Payments call w/Disputifier CEO, Mark Wagner in 45 minutes!

On April 1st of this year, there will be changes made with chargebacks / disputes and how these are calculated along with new thresholds & criteria.

[15.01.25, 23:17:26] ~ Christopher Murphy: Anyone in this group running telehealth?
[16.01.25, 5:52:27] ~ Mikael: About Airwallex. Anyone here running airwallex and the total money on the acc doesnt match the profitcalc  in the store? Its like 20% less profit in our airwallex acc than whats shown in the actual profit calc..
[16.01.25, 6:19:37] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey it could be for a few reasons…delay from transactions being recorded and actually settled in your AW account. Or from CBs, any refunds or chargebacks last 30 days, might not be immediately reflecting in your profit cal 

But double check ‎<This message was edited>
[16.01.25, 6:25:40] China Bigboss: Hey it might be for the holds depends on your agreement also as Natasha mentioned might be some refunds charge backs or delayed on the payouts
[16.01.25, 6:48:00] ~ Mikael: Yeah we have holds and late payouts. Due to too long payouts we had to stop advertising. So we let all money be paid out to the account. But afterwords when everything is paid out. The profit differed with about 20% which is alot. (Yes wr calculated all the fees etc)
[16.01.25, 6:51:26] China Bigboss: Something wrong is the account in HK or USA?
[16.01.25, 6:54:04] ~ Mikael: HK bro
[16.01.25, 6:58:13] China Bigboss: Dm bro let me check with Airwallex in HK to check what is wrong

[16.01.25, 13:12:43] ~ Facundo: guys is it fine to use one same fb ad account for 2 different domains? normally we just use 1 account per domain/country for risk diversification purposes, but just wondering if there is any risk on having multiple domains under one same fb ad account
[16.01.25, 13:15:41] ~ Malak: Yes you can pm me! Everyone can pm me, no worries guys got already a lot of messages hahaha.
[16.01.25, 13:16:22] ~ Malak: I do 1 domain 1 ad-account bro, but I think there should be a higher risk with doing 2 domains but idk.
[16.01.25, 13:37:44] ~ Facundo: thanks man, think i will stick with just one domain per account then
[16.01.25, 13:45:15] Matán Intsuper: no issue. we have a domain for advertorials and we advertise from the same fb account. there's no risk

[17.01.25, 11:16:34] ~ Mo: guys when working with video editors ( who dont speak the language) for the EU markets (FR, DE) , do u provide the voice over ? do they do everyhting themselves ( generate VO + video editing ..) . i tried to provide the voice over ( but it sucked, look like a bot , i use elevenlabs)  + it didnt sync well when video editor tried to put all together. any advice ? 🙏
[17.01.25, 11:20:58] ~ Carlos Leeseman: It’s pretty hard, we’re struggling with it as well. But watch the VSL module from Topi in the ESS course. There you see the briefing you can make for your video editor, so he knows exactly what kind of clips and captions he need to use for the voice over.
[17.01.25, 11:22:07] Jordi: I write my script like this

1) english version
Local version

2) english version
Local version

...


And every line number is connected to the voice over audio files so for example
 1.mp3 is for line 1

2.mp3 is fir line 2
... etc
[17.01.25, 11:22:27] Jordi: It works pretty well for me
[17.01.25, 11:22:33] ~ Carlos Leeseman: In the beginning it’s okay if you make the VO by yourself, but eventually you want to make the VO by a native person, so it’s sounds better
[17.01.25, 11:24:18] Jordi: U can do the same to the native person... give him the script numbered and make him/her name the voice over audio files also by number
[17.01.25, 11:52:34] ~ Mo: yeah man kinda hard. yeah makes sense, got it will do bro !
[17.01.25, 11:53:50] ~ Mo: and u still do that yourself right ( generate vo for each line…) ? not your video editor
[17.01.25, 11:55:00] ~ Carlos Leeseman: For my own language yes. For other languages I have market manager/VA
[17.01.25, 11:57:14] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Sorry just saw this message is not for me ‎<This message was edited>
[17.01.25, 11:57:39] Jordi: Well I am only doing like 3 new scripts a week so not scaling that big yet... but I can show u an example
[17.01.25, 11:57:53] Jordi: So yea still doing it myself with eleven labs...
[17.01.25, 11:58:36] Jordi: If u are scaling bigger i would just hire a local creative strategist and make them do all the work
[17.01.25, 11:58:38] ~ Mo: nah bro it helps haha ! thanks man , the market manager VA is native in the target language or not ?
[17.01.25, 11:59:57] ~ Mo: got it man, i use 11labs too, but it looks shitty like a bot, any tricks how to make more human, u clone a voice ?
[17.01.25, 12:00:50] Jordi: Wait, really?? Mine look soo real hahaha
[17.01.25, 12:01:06] ~ Carlos Leeseman: Yes correct
[17.01.25, 12:01:07] Jordi: Maybe u need to look for native voices
[17.01.25, 12:01:26] Jordi: U can add the language when looking for voices and make sure its a native voice
[17.01.25, 12:01:58] ~ Carlos Leeseman: To create better voices: better hire voice actor on Fiverr, let him record 10-20 minutes and then clone his voice in 11labs
[17.01.25, 12:02:38] Jordi: Hahahaa thats sick what do u tell them?
[17.01.25, 12:16:48] ~ Gedion: Look for Ugc’s from big brands doing numbers in that language.

Clone the voices inside elevenlabs.
That works best for me!
[17.01.25, 12:30:32] Jordi: Hey guys,

When doing thank you emails and some information about the product to customers 50+ do u recommend using plain text or visuals? I heard visuals and loads of colors can make it difficult to read for them. The point is to give valuable information they will need or can use for the product
[17.01.25, 12:31:12] Jordi: I will send them a series of emails over a few days to give them useful information
‎[17.01.25, 16:49:39] ~ Thomas Dolcini: ‎image omitted
[17.01.25, 16:50:41] ~ David B: Plain text has better deliverability and is less likely to hit spam.
[17.01.25, 17:00:28] Jordi: Perfect!!!

[17.01.25, 18:02:37] Matán Intsuper: Id go for ABO with targeting
[17.01.25, 18:06:10] ~ Jacob: It can be mix, if u already bring winners to the account, ill do abo just to see if the results of the winner is consistent like the other account, from the test i just did yesterday for a new account the winner brought sales immediately, and than ill put it in 50$ cbo  after a day or 2 while continue running abo

traffic to advertorial that converts about 30/40% of the traffic ‎<This message was edited>
[18.01.25, 18:02:12] ~ Jacob: converts?
[18.01.25, 18:02:20] ~ Jacob: you mean 30/40 go to next step
[18.01.25, 18:02:20] ~ Jacob: ?
[18.01.25, 18:02:27] ~ L: Yes
[18.01.25, 18:03:38] ~ Jacob: so there are few things you can do...

1.) is put a chatbot in your site, or something they can talk to, so you will understand why they are not buying, or collect emails and actually try to contact few potential customers
2.) you didn't share how much checkouts you got on this price as well
[18.01.25, 18:03:53] ~ Jacob: you need to understand where are they falling
[18.01.25, 18:04:04] ~ Jacob: and why
[18.01.25, 18:04:50] Jordi: Would u add a chatbot also on the advertorial??
[18.01.25, 18:05:03] ~ Jacob: i would add it to where they are falling
[18.01.25, 18:05:13] Jordi: I just added a chatbot but thought it might better not be on an advertorial
[18.01.25, 18:05:15] ~ Jacob: but you first need to understand which part in the funnel
[18.01.25, 18:05:29] ~ Jacob: ah and about the chatbot, i think on the sales page
[18.01.25, 18:05:36] ~ Jacob: thats what i did
[18.01.25, 18:05:38] Jordi: Yea thats what i did
[18.01.25, 18:05:49] ~ Jacob: but you use it for cro i guess
[18.01.25, 18:05:55] ~ Jacob: he needs to use it to gather more data first
[18.01.25, 18:05:56] ~ L: very low atc rate - very low IC rate 

I’d exclude it’s the offer, but the advertorial was converting well for us for a very similar offer in the same niche
[18.01.25, 18:05:57] ~ Jacob: because he is not converting
[18.01.25, 18:06:08] ~ Jacob: bro you need to speak numbers to get help
[18.01.25, 18:06:14] ~ Jacob: 100$ > how much checkouts
[18.01.25, 18:06:19] ~ Jacob: i dont mind the rate
[18.01.25, 18:06:26] ~ Jacob: i mind how much checkouts and whats the cost per checkout
[19.01.25, 13:07:42] ~ Mo: guys is there a way to untick the shop pay  “save my info” section in checkout, its automatically ticked
‎[19.01.25, 13:08:47] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
[19.01.25, 13:48:43] ~ L: Guys do you issue seeing Facebook Feedback score?
[19.01.25, 14:12:59] ~ Jacob: Unfortunately, the "Save my info" checkbox in Shop Pay is a feature managed by Shopify, and it is typically set to be pre-checked by default to streamline the checkout experience for returning customers. As a merchant, you do not have direct control over changing this default behavior in the checkout settings.

However, here are a few things you can do:

1. Contact Shopify Support

Shopify may be able to provide guidance or a custom solution, but in most cases, this behavior cannot be modified due to compliance and user experience considerations.


2. Customize Checkout (Shopify Plus Only)

If you're using Shopify Plus, you can customize your checkout process more extensively. This might allow you to modify or provide additional guidance about the checkbox. Consult your developer or Shopify's documentation for details.


3. Provide Transparency

Add a note in your privacy policy or on the checkout page explaining how Shop Pay works, so customers are aware of the feature and how their information is handled.


4. Customer Education

Include an FAQ or notice for customers about Shop Pay’s opt-out options. For example, they can uncheck the box before proceeding or remove their information later through the Shop app.


If you need help creating a customer-friendly explanation or adding notices to your store, let me know!

At first I had an account doing $5k/day banned and now working back up to that I got a $2k/day one banned. 

The insiders have been super annoying and I’ve been in contact with 2 insiders recommended for the past 3 weeks but they’ve been super slow in responding and keep delaying it

I’m just looking for some resources or videos that run a full breakthrough on how to dodge Facebook bans

[21.01.25, 5:07:00] ~ Luka: Just wanted to share a cool method that takes one-time effort to gets you free $$$ passively + email optins. I rarely see brands do this.

On your packaging or leaflet, add a warranty registration QR Code. Have it lead to an opt-in form and then redirect users to your catalog page upon submission. On the catalog page you can write a message confirming their warranty registration and give them a limited-time coupon code (or min spend threshold) to get them to shop again.

This also also a great way to obtain email optins from your Amazon/platform customers and train customers to shop on your website. We don't sell on Amazon so make sure to abide by their rules
[21.01.25, 5:08:14] ~ Luka: QR Code on Packaging/Leaflet ➡️ Warranty Registration Optin Form ➡️ Catalog Page ‎<This message was edited>
[21.01.25, 5:09:27] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Our brand does this. We sell a lot on Amazon. While I don't know exactly how many people it has funneled back to our site or email list, our list is over 100k so I have to think it has helped.
[21.01.25, 7:17:39] ~ Mike Barnwell: Hey guys I have supplier on Alibaba that is saying they need our trademark in order to ship our inventory and now they are trying to get me to make two seperate payments so that each order is below the 10K threshold for a customs inspection. Has anyone heard of this. Seems really shady. They say once we pay the new invoice they will refund the original invoice we paid.
[21.01.25, 13:00:18] ~ Mohammed-amine: Hey guys, how do you find VSLs to replicate? I’m using VidTao, but it doesn’t have a lot content

I am facing some issues with buying fake comments... it always worked perfect and since a week or 2 ago the link i am providing is not working, they told me to open it in incognito window and have a look myself and it is saying content not available... but I have already added a few tomes fake comments on the exact same link! And just since a 2 weeks ago its not possible. I tried different ways to share the link but nothing works... anyone experience with this? Or know the solution? Its just an ad that has been running for over a month

[21.01.25, 15:44:29] ~ Gedion: Hey @⁨Jordi⁩ 💪

[21.01.25, 16:24:06] ~ Matthew Martorano: I would suggest taking the sale as an “auth” not a capture. Then send notice one day before being sent that the item arrive and will be shipped the following day. Then bill the card and send to fulfillment.
[21.01.25, 17:48:39] ~ Slav: Hey guys!
How do you make the upsell pages?

For instance, I want to do logic when a person presses the button “proceed to checkout” or “buy now”, before he goes to the checkout page, he goes to the upsell page and only then to the checkout page.

What tools do you usually use for this on Shopify?
[21.01.25, 17:50:48] ~ Mike Kasdorf: We use custom page funnel/upsells and the Zipify one click upsell app
[21.01.25, 17:51:17] ~ Slav: And then just connect it to a shopify store?
[21.01.25, 18:25:17] ~ Jacob: guys someone know a dropship supplier that work on this holiday of china (spring festival) or they are all taking vacation?
[21.01.25, 18:28:12] ~ Jacob: i mean without buying inventory
[21.01.25, 18:28:14] ~ Allan L: A lot of agents are working, problem is the factories are taking vacation so You can't get new products to your agent.
[21.01.25, 18:28:48] ~ Jacob: yeah, that was my question if someone know someone who keep working anyways
[21.01.25, 18:29:02] ~ Jacob: like a factory
[21.01.25, 18:29:12] China Bigboss: At the official holiday time all china will be not working even you have stock you can ship it out
[21.01.25, 18:29:29] ~ Allan L: As in factories? dont think so, kinda depends on what you're selling.
[21.01.25, 18:30:03] China Bigboss: All factories already off work most of them even start from the 15th
[21.01.25, 18:31:12] ~ Reece Mander: everything shuts down for new year celebrations in china. Then there is a backlog of orders. bad time to place an order right now
[21.01.25, 18:46:11] ~ Calvin: Depends, if you do have inventory some agents will be working. On our end theres only a 3 day period where orders will not be shipped out. Rest of CNY our agents team will be working.
[21.01.25, 18:54:45] ~ Guy Edan: I had a supplier once asking to do the 2 separate orders for the $10k threshold and it was fine. if it's above $10k they need to pay a fee from my understanding. The trademark is strange and I would ask why they need it, and the payment is also IMO a no-no (without having all the context). I would tell them that they are causing the issues so they refund it and you'll make a new payment once you receive the refund. If you are paying via Alibaba, I wouldn't worry too much because as long as you have the terms written down in the invoice, if the supplier tries to do something shady, you will get refunded
[21.01.25, 22:36:18] ~ Nico Neumann: Hey bro, I use Gethookd for this. Also find some big brands that do VSLs and watch their ad library regularly. You‘ll find a ton of VSLs to replicate this way.
[21.01.25, 23:37:37] ~ Jacob: guys from your experience, would you recommend more for charge blast or chargeflow?

Me and my 2 business partners Jake and Finn recently joined the community 

A little about us: All 21/22 and started ecom around one year ago, being based in Thailand/Cyprus. We’ve been able to rack up a bit over 3Mil in Euros over the time but with several stores and inconsistencies along the way and mainly focusing on the European market. 

Outside of ecom we’re all big into sports and martial arts, Muay Thai, BJJ etc. and nutrition, health all the good stuff.

We really look forward meeting you all and hope to become an asset to this community. We’re always down to connect so I’ll also leave our IG’s here, feel free to send DM

[22.01.25, 18:55:25] ~ Jacob: 2.) if it's connected to a company in hong kong/us or u just using it as a bank
[22.01.25, 18:55:46] ~ Jacob: im using it for payment processing and as a bank, for few months, and thanks god it's works good
[22.01.25, 18:56:06] ~ Jacob: and their support always responds to me in a kind way usually
[22.01.25, 18:56:13] ~ Jacob: im operating with hong kong company
[22.01.25, 18:57:28] ~ Jacob: Like, just blocking accounts randomly for holding money sounds weird to me
[22.01.25, 18:58:31] ~ Jacob: if you want to minimize the risk, maybe open another one if you can, or open another subaccount inside your airwallex and split the money to minimize risk
[22.01.25, 19:26:54] ~ Yusuf Business: Thanks, yes I operate with HK company and see no reason to be blocked, just wanted to make sure if someone was blocked for no reason
[22.01.25, 19:28:00] ~ Jacob: yeah but still it always good to split the money
[22.01.25, 19:28:02] ~ Jacob: who knows
[22.01.25, 20:47:07] ~ Mo: Ben using airwallex with HK structure too never had issues
[22.01.25, 22:55:26] ~ Slav: Hey guys 

I was wondering if there is any way to fix a problem with AI customer service.

ZipChat answers right after you ask it a question and writes word-by-word.

I would like it to take time before answering and give the whole answer instead of writing it in front of the customer.

Any ideas on how to fix it?
[22.01.25, 22:56:36] ~ Akshay: Hi all, my ad account was restricted and Facebook says the decision is final. What can I do in this situation in terms of next steps or precautions to continue to advertise on Facebook?
[22.01.25, 23:31:45] Jordi: Im sure if u talk with the zipchat support they can fix that
[22.01.25, 23:32:35] ~ Slav: Yeah, I thought so too, but the were not really helpful
[22.01.25, 23:33:31] Jordi: Hmm thats weird...  in that case i am not sure 😅
[23.01.25, 1:24:18] ~ L: is anyone able to chat with Facebook support?
they make it harder everytime to reach them 😅

[23.01.25, 3:20:06] ~ Ислам: Can you please share how many fake comments you order so that it would work to decrease cpm ?
[23.01.25, 3:26:20] ~ Ислам: Can someone else share how many likes and comments you order to decrease cpm ?
[23.01.25, 7:59:47] Jordi: It even helps with conversion if u write good comments. 


I always write results plus questions! For example for anti aging:

My forehead wrinkles are mostly gone after 3 weeks of use. Does it also remove the nasolabial folds? 

(Me answering the fake comment:

Ahh thats great that you are seeing results already, make sure to keep using it consistently for at least 90 days for optimal results, most people saw improvements in the nasolabial folds after 6 weeks.
[23.01.25, 8:00:52] Jordi: And ofcourse some more faq u can find from amazon! Just combine them with small results so it gives hope
[23.01.25, 8:01:18] ~ Ислам: Thank you! How many comments do you usually buy ?
[23.01.25, 8:05:12] Jordi: The problem is that the website i was using before only gave like 5 commemts each time... now i recently got a contact for up to 2000 comments! Just bought yesterday 30 comments to see how things are going and maybe i will up that!

If u dont want to buy a lot of comments, write comments that start discussions!

For example for anti pimples:

I dont understand qhy people are wasting their money on this shit, i just try to pop them as soon as possible before they get big and then they never get the chance to grow.
[23.01.25, 8:05:32] Jordi: People will start discussing why that is stupid..
[23.01.25, 8:05:40] Jordi: And u get a lot more comments
[23.01.25, 8:05:45] Jordi: Lower cpm
[23.01.25, 8:07:06] ~ Ислам: Can you share that website please?

[23.01.25, 15:41:06] ~ JULIUS: Yeah Kaching Bundles on Shopify is great for crafting bundles!
[23.01.25, 15:41:30] ~ Gedion: Pp

[23.01.25, 16:22:16] ~ Gedion: Some offers have normal price - some price per unit.
[23.01.25, 16:31:19] ~ JULIUS: Oh yeah I see, I belive it's not possible to do that on Kaching but you can easily put a text under the title "ONLY $6.50 EACH"

[24.01.25, 2:04:45] ~ L: Guys for those who use Shrine on shopify, have you found it to be slow when loading product pages?
I have every content compressed and it’s still pretty slow to load and GTMetrix gives a B

Any recommendation? was wondering if it was a Theme problem
[24.01.25, 2:23:13] ~ Arif: Sometimes yes, it really depends on the content. We just go on fiverr and buy a Shopify speed optimization
[24.01.25, 2:27:40] ~ L: Does this solve the issue?
Can you recommend someone who did a good job?
[24.01.25, 3:09:27] ~ Finn Aurel Schlarb: https://www.fiverr.com/hamzaashraf988

[24.01.25, 3:54:01] ~ Arif: It definitely makes the store faster
[24.01.25, 4:47:10] ~ Justin: Just have to make sure they actually make the store faster. I’ve been scammed before from fiverr, the guy just added a piece of code that tricked softwares like gtmetrix and google lighthouse.
[24.01.25, 4:48:24] ~ Justin: The code worked by loading a blank html page whenever it was requested from domains including Google light house and gtmetrix, etc. Very sneaky.
[24.01.25, 4:49:05] ~ Justin: And obviously a blank page is very fast to load 😅😂
[24.01.25, 4:50:19] ~ Arif: I understand your concerns bro but we’ve never had issues with this guy
[24.01.25, 4:50:55] ~ Justin: I don’t doubt that! Just an fyi

[25.01.25, 1:59:09] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hey guys, my 3PL in China will be halting shipments for 7 days, and my current chargeback rate on Shopify is 0.95% in this brand (chargeflow stopped work suddenly). Should I push sales to lower the chargeback rate, or pause them for 3-4 days to avoid a 7-day processing delay on orders? I’m concerned that Shopify might flag the account for extended processing times, but I also don’t want the chargeback rate to exceed 1%. What would you recommend? Thanks in advance 🙏🏼 ‎<This message was edited>
[25.01.25, 2:25:51] ~ JULIUS: What I did was to add on your product / sales page a RED text like this one for example:
"We’ve gone viral on TikTok! Due to overwhelming demand, we're out of stock... Orders placed today will ship on February 7th. Thank you for your patience! "
[25.01.25, 2:26:25] ~ JULIUS: You wanna put this on the above field area so people can't miss it (ideally around ATC button)
[25.01.25, 2:28:56] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I’ve already done that bro, main concern is not losing the payment processor and not ending up with holds.
[25.01.25, 2:31:34] Matán Intsuper: Chargeblast
[25.01.25, 2:32:43] ~ JULIUS: I'm not a PSP expert but you can easily lose it when your dispute rate and/or refund raises rapidly -> you can avoid this easily with a clear communication & send that info on their email order confirmation
[25.01.25, 2:37:15] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hmm, Chargeflow was good but suddenly it started underperforming. It’s probably preventing around 30% now, while they claim it’s supposed to be around 90%. I’m going to try this
[25.01.25, 2:40:26] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Yeah, if i suddenly stop sales, it looks suspicious. But sounds a good idea inform them instantly, thanks @⁨~JULIUS⁩ ‎<This message was edited>

Do you use broad targeting? Or do you use interests ?

[25.01.25, 17:52:00] ~ Ислам: Is it ok for testing?
[25.01.25, 18:01:29] ~ Mohammed-amine: What's your aov?
[25.01.25, 18:01:37] Jordi: Yeaa for big markets like the US its probably better to warm up ur pixel with interest testing
[25.01.25, 18:01:47] ~ Ислам: 150$
[25.01.25, 18:02:08] ~ Mohammed-amine: cpm too high
[25.01.25, 18:02:22] ~ Mohammed-amine: work on your creatives and conversions rate
[25.01.25, 18:02:30] ~ Mohammed-amine: to get lower cpm
[25.01.25, 18:03:23] ~ Ислам: Creatives and conversion rate is pretty good
[25.01.25, 18:05:01] Jordi: U can always buy fake comments
[25.01.25, 18:05:08] Jordi: That also lowers ur cpm
[25.01.25, 18:08:39] ~ Alejandro H.: What do you use for comments brother ?
[25.01.25, 18:10:02] ~ Mohammed-amine: if they were good you will have low cpm
[25.01.25, 18:11:36] ~ Ислам: Conversion rate was about 2% and the creatives car are also good about 1.5 and 2
[25.01.25, 18:12:02] ~ Ислам: And I am wondering why cpm is high
[25.01.25, 18:12:55] ~ Ислам: Maybe that is because of high competition with my particular product? ‎<This message was edited>
[25.01.25, 18:33:14] ~ Mohammed-amine: Why are you focusing on CPM on particular?
[25.01.25, 18:33:20] ~ Mohammed-amine: what's your ROAS?
[25.01.25, 18:46:41] ~ Ислам: Actually conversion rate is good

[26.01.25, 17:29:10] ~ Jacob: hey guys i wanted to give you tip i discover this week and it can save a lot of money for you: if you open your business manager, on a country that there is VAT there, facebook will charge you this IVA on top of the spend (for example, you spend 900$, they will charge you almost 170$ extra if the tax is 17%) - and you dont get any traffic with this tax to be clear. and they pretty hiding it, it's not so clear at all, you can see it if you will go to your billing and click on your transcation, than you will see what go to tax and what went for spend. and unfortuntately, there is no way to change the country once it was opened (i talk with customer service on phone, it's impossible at moment)

what you can do? open another "portfolio" , on my business manager, i can open until 5 portoflios, which every portofolio include 5-10 ad accounts, and than you put it on a country that doesent pay VAT (like hong kong for example or whatever, its doesent really matter) - and than you will avoid this bullshit
[26.01.25, 17:33:26] ~ Ислам: Thanks man, it doesn't reflect on usa right?
[26.01.25, 17:34:16] ~ Jacob: I dont know about USA, but just to make sure, you can go to your billing, just click one of your last payment, and if there is no tax there, it should be ok
[26.01.25, 17:58:02] ~ Luka: Just be careful that you aren't actually breaking the law where your LLC is incorporated else that's tax evasion
[26.01.25, 17:59:52] ~ Jacob: ?
[26.01.25, 18:00:14] ~ Jacob: I dont have llc but i dont understand how u can break the law here
[26.01.25, 18:02:33] ~ Luka: For ex. an Australian LLC selling in Australia has to pay 10% VAT on Meta ad spend.
If the Australian LLC dodges it by just choosing another country on Meta, that's tax evasion
[26.01.25, 18:03:38] ~ Jacob: but usually you pay the vat directly to your goverement, so actualy if you pay it to meta as well it's double, and anyway, who can know that?
[26.01.25, 18:05:48] ~ Luka: It's country by country basis. For my Thai entity (BM = Thai) Meta doesn't charge us VAT, but on each invoice it tells us we have to pay the VAT ourselves ‎<This message was edited>
[26.01.25, 18:05:59] ~ Luka: For Australia example, Meta charges the vat ‎<This message was edited>
[26.01.25, 18:06:33] ~ Omid: Ya it depends, in Canada if you put that in there it’s so you don’t get double taxed on ads as they are exempt( so you don’t get charged hst and gst if you have the number)

If you don’t put the gst number in a canadian accounts case, they will charge you gst and hst on your invoice if empty ‎<This message was edited>
[27.01.25, 1:38:18] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys

Installing a post purchase app now will Triple Whale track the after sales or do you need to install a script in the checkout settings on Shopify? ‎<This message was edited>
[27.01.25, 10:04:10] ~ Mo: Notify means customer returned the product —> so refund anyways
[27.01.25, 10:05:08] ~ Mo: I use Tw and it just assign the post purchase to the original order
[27.01.25, 10:28:51] ~ Arif: Hey guys, does anyone has a safe and reliable website or contact to buy trustpilot reviews ?

[27.01.25, 10:35:05] Jordi: Ahhh dude... wait until u sell to belgian or dutch people!
[27.01.25, 10:36:09] Jordi: I have reviews of people that did not even purchased anything... they just found the shipping time is 7 days and they wrote me like:

Fake chinese shit dont buy it! 

I asked for their order number and email and they couldn't provide that only email and they had no order
[27.01.25, 10:36:20] ~ Arif: Klarna above 10%
[27.01.25, 10:36:30] ~ Arif: It’s no joke
[27.01.25, 10:36:43] ~ Arif: Ridiculous
[27.01.25, 10:36:45] Jordi: What do u mean by that?
[27.01.25, 10:37:02] ~ Arif: Like the case rate
[27.01.25, 10:38:17] ~ Arif: It’s nuts bro we’ve had only 1 credit card chargebacks in almost 100k orders but klarna is fucking us over
[27.01.25, 10:40:37] Jordi: Damn

[27.01.25, 17:07:28] Sina Bagheri: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y-kc8PseWM&t=420s
[27.01.25, 19:18:33] ~ Ислам: Who tested this strategy? Does it work M
[27.01.25, 19:18:34] ~ Ислам: ?
[27.01.25, 19:19:05] Jordi: I tried and failed hahaha 😅 the moment i upped my budget i had no more sales
[27.01.25, 19:21:22] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Test it regularly it’s only worked a handful of times 😬 getting good conversion rates but cost per purchase is very high so no margins. Currently trying increase AOV hopefully this will fix the problem
[27.01.25, 19:21:46] ~ L: Same here- 
did you find a solution or you completely shifted your strategy?
[27.01.25, 19:24:50] Jordi: Huh?? So very high CPC I guess?
[27.01.25, 19:25:21] Jordi: Completely shifted
[27.01.25, 19:25:39] Jordi: I will rry it again in the future
[27.01.25, 19:26:00] Jordi: I guess u need very strong broad creatives for it
[27.01.25, 19:26:56] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: They aren’t too bad usually takes like a day to climb back up but usually if I try hit past like 300,400 dollars everything goes 💩 ‎<This message was edited>
[27.01.25, 19:27:35] ~ L: which strategy are you using now? I think we may have the same issue , I also thought my ads were not appealing to a broad enough audience
[27.01.25, 19:28:50] Jordi: For current winners: just increasing budget by 25% a day and triple duplicating.

For future creatives trying to improve my creatives 😅
[27.01.25, 20:28:56] ~ Reece Mander: You TRIPLE the budget of a winner?
[27.01.25, 20:30:09] Sina Bagheri: Nah. After getting an adset that is consistently profitable over 3 days, you duplicate it 3 times at $100 ‎<This message was edited>
[27.01.25, 20:32:06] ~ Reece Mander: Duplicate the ad set and change what?
[27.01.25, 20:32:08] ~ Damjan Topalovic: just 5x the budget you tested with on all 3 ad sets
[27.01.25, 20:32:26] ~ Reece Mander: Might explain why mine fell off a cliff when I went from 20 to 200 in a day 🤣
[27.01.25, 20:32:28] Jordi: Exactly that
[27.01.25, 20:33:31] Sina Bagheri: Afterwards @⁨~Jeremy Leppink⁩  says to only keep on the one that gets the first sale but I find that sometimes all 3 are profitable
[27.01.25, 20:35:46] Jordi: and this! ‎<This message was edited>
[27.01.25, 20:37:16] Jordi: Yea I get the same! But its recommended to keep the one with the best soft mettics (best ctr, cpm, etc)

As u will have 2 adsets in the same pocket
[28.01.25, 3:31:09] ~ Jake: Does anyone use Shopify payment with an HK entity?
[28.01.25, 3:44:22] Sina Bagheri: Does anyone pay for ads with their own cards even with an agency account?

I recently switched to an agency account and the way they do it is I pay them then they add on the spending limit but that’s already brought up problems like processed fees and delays
[28.01.25, 6:57:15] ~ Austin: That’s how I’ve heard it’s always done with agency’s. The cash back is great but for me less moving parts is a win, being why I stay personal account and max out the banks credit card benefits….if you have Bank of America and hold atleast 100k balance in account for 90+ days you get 5% cash back on credit card alone
‎[28.01.25, 11:04:20] ~ Ислам: ‎image omitted
[28.01.25, 11:18:09] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I've already done that a few times, but it wasn't worth it.
[28.01.25, 11:27:06] ~ Kamal: Woah which card gets you 5% cash back? Is it unlimited? Never seen it that high
[28.01.25, 11:27:39] ~ Kamal: It worked okay for me but if you have post purchase upsells you lose that
[28.01.25, 11:29:35] Jordi: Me neither... I have seen it as high as 4% but with a limit
[28.01.25, 12:21:03] ~ David B: Hey guys, no copy call today but I you have anything urgent that you would like reviewed, please send it over in a DM and I will take a look at it.  

If you haven't watched Mark's video about ad creation, I strongly recommend it. 

We both use almost the same system for creating scripts and the focus on hooks in huge!

If you haven't played with my hook generator, here it is again. Just plug in your script and it'll whip up some winners for you.

[29.01.25, 8:37:34] Jordi: Hmmm, it depends... i buy comments that make other people commemt as well, so i get more engagement... the thing about facebook is that they want to keep people on their platform, so if u get people to interact with your ads, they will show it to more people

[31.01.25, 11:58:44] ~ Mohammed-amine: need to delete old campaigns

[31.01.25, 12:02:04] Jordi: Did u try it from another browser to see if its the same?
[31.01.25, 12:02:19] ~ Mohammed-amine: Same
[31.01.25, 12:05:20] Jordi: I guess it should be related to the amount of campaigns u have 😅 not sure if anyone else can give u more input. I could have a look with u to check if it is related to the amount of requests it needs to make, and if there are some javascript errors popping up
[31.01.25, 12:14:45] ~ Adam K.: I have been doing aff seo for 8 yrs, with quite decent results and I can not recommend any agency because mostly you will be charged for organic results + they will spend around 1h of work per month on your project.

First you need to know whats your goal:
a) new traffic from general keywords in your niche and position your product there
b) make your site at the top for your particular product unique name (not general keyword like lawn mower, because there you have no chance for general terms without knowledge in seo )

if b) - it would be pretty easy for independent seo consultant
You should form a plan formed on topical map of terms you want to cover/build your blog/site about

To sum up - seo is very long term game where you invest without guarantee of success. Its content + links game. 

PM if you have any questions
[31.01.25, 12:15:16] ~ Mohammed-amine: That’s appreciated bro, do you recommend I reach out to a developer or what type of speciality to solve this?
[31.01.25, 12:21:15] ~ Mo: I haven’t so far
[31.01.25, 12:21:16] ~ Mo: U can be director urself, i dont have office there
[31.01.25, 12:22:14] Jordi: Nahh no need to waste money on that! I would only try to see where the issue is coming from! Probably best to contact facebook itself

[1.02.25, 7:42:29] ~ Mike Barnwell: Hey so this just looks like chatgpt? I have used this for creating hooks so how is this different than what I am already using with chatgpt?
[1.02.25, 8:08:39] Jordi: Its a custom GPT, it means he configured the chatgpt to create hooks according to his rules, and guidelines
[1.02.25, 8:09:44] Jordi: So if u ask the same question about hooks to his gpt or to normal chatgpt u will get different answers.

The answers in his GPT will be much better for hooks ‎<This message was edited>
[1.02.25, 8:13:19] ~ Mike Barnwell: Thanks I have quite a few so looking forward to this for our ugc creators.
[1.02.25, 9:57:52] Jordi: I personally would do the hooks with AI voiceover and the rest with the ugc creators in that way u can test and iterate at a much higher volume
[1.02.25, 9:58:12] Jordi: And only do the winning hooks with the ugc creators
[1.02.25, 10:11:27] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys are there any ai apps out there where you can upload an image of your product and it will make exact variations of it? I’ve been using mid journey but the images always come back super weird or bizarre af lol
[1.02.25, 17:52:08] ~ Zvi: hey all started a new product in france getting mixed results each day could it be becouse i selected on the ads set up advantage + audiences VS just leaving it Broad without that setting ?
[1.02.25, 20:01:57] ~ JULIUS: Anyone experienced with getting AI UGC Testimonials Videos?
[2.02.25, 3:36:03] ~ Arif: I mean if you don’t really have any pixel data why would you even select a+ audience ? While testing your goal is to get as much data as possible to then judge if it’s a potential winner or not
[2.02.25, 3:36:31] ~ Zvi: Makes sense thanks
[2.02.25, 13:37:19] ~ Mo: hey guys i have a section in my shopify pdp, a video slider ( ugcs of my product) , can i have the same section in funnelish, does it slow it down in ur experience ?
[2.02.25, 15:14:07] ~ Sonu Duhra: Anyone doing smart campaigns on TikTok?
[2.02.25, 18:26:27] ~ Ислам: Guys do you know how to spy what countries ads of your competitors are running ?
[2.02.25, 18:31:38] ~ Fabian: ‎~ Thomas Quinteros added ~ Fabian
[2.02.25, 19:53:02] ~ Kevin Krieg: Yea we only run with smart campaigns. They are the most consistent for us
[2.02.25, 19:56:17] ~ Sonu Duhra: How does the setup look like? I mean cost cap or just lowest cost and how many creatives. And how do you optimise the creatives or you don’t, because you can’t see the ads on ad level. Sorry man, many questions.
[2.02.25, 20:32:12] Matán Intsuper: in fb ad library
[2.02.25, 20:32:16] Matán Intsuper: you can choose a country
[2.02.25, 20:32:21] ~ Kevin Krieg: Just lowest cost, leave everything broad/as is. 

We usually do 3-5 creatives per campaign and then just as many campaigns as our scale allows. But depends on your scale.  You can do more creatives per camp.

No more "optimizing" after that. We just throw them in there and if it works, cool increase budgets. If not, kill and move on from that set of creatives. Just learn from the data
[2.02.25, 21:08:37] ~ Sonu Duhra: Thanks man 👍
[3.02.25, 11:04:04] ~ Kamal: Hey guys, is it normal for a fb ad agency to require full Business Manager admin permissions?
[3.02.25, 12:40:59] ~ Mo: guys , i wanna reverse engineer one brand’ funnel, buy their product to see their upsells structure etc… lets say i wanna build the same upsells, what do i need to do, take screenshots and send them to my dev to do the same ? thats it ?
[3.02.25, 12:51:54] ~ Reece Mander: maybe grab the URL too
[3.02.25, 12:57:04] Jordi: I guess it depends on his skills... also, maybe explain how the funnel has to work. He can create all with html and css but he needs to know when clicking a button what needs to happen
[3.02.25, 13:07:06] ~ Mo: got it so i’ll have him with me when placing the order, so he can chek the html code , and all the steps
[3.02.25, 13:43:37] Matán Intsuper: Make a loom and take the urls
[3.02.25, 16:09:26] ~ Malak: Hi guys, does anyone have insider by Mastercard or VISA?

[3.02.25, 23:21:12] ~ Kain: Hi guys, wich subscription app do you recommend?
[3.02.25, 23:27:24] ~ Kevin Krieg: You can use chrome extension like Fireshot to screenshot/save the whole page as a pdf.

Its very handy when talking to devs. 

There is also a chrome extension called html to design. It grabs a page and you can upload it to figma, instantly making it editable.  Thats also very handy when talking to devs.

Or if its a simple page and not complicated, I would use chrome extension "singlefile" to download the pages html, css and script. Then upload it to chatgpt and say you want the same stuff coded. With a bit of communicating and tweaking it will make the same thing for you. Only effective for simple stuff, otherwise it takes too long. Dev better in that case
[3.02.25, 23:28:01] Victor: hey @⁨~Alexander⁩ guys meet Alexander, our newest ESS client!! He is ready to learn, connect with you all and scale!!
[3.02.25, 23:29:17] ~ Kevin Krieg: Guys question: Does the Shopify Stripe hack with France still work? Like creating a new store, setting address to FR, connecting Stripe and then changing address to real one but maintining Stripe?

Have one store where its handy, just dont know if Shopify somehow punishes that.
[3.02.25, 23:30:02] Jordi: Yea but france not... u have to use another country... i thought it was croatia or something, anyone remembers?
[3.02.25, 23:56:39] ~ Kevin Krieg: Yea I hear Estonia. But do you know if they sort of punish it down the road? Seems like sth they could potentially do, but maybe im just paranoid haha
[4.02.25, 0:07:12] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys just joined mercury bank does anyone have feedback or anything to look out for? is there a way to get daily spends lifted ?
[4.02.25, 2:32:05] ~ Mo: thanks man you G !
[4.02.25, 3:46:49] ~ Calvin: I used my EIN to register for Shopify payments not SSN/ITIN as I didn't have one and they only picked it up now a year later, they didn't close the account but asked for my ITIN for tax reporting and they are giving me 2 months to upload it.
I assume down the line they won't immediately punish you but may ask you for some extra info or to correct the address
[4.02.25, 3:48:13] ~ Austin: What do you guys find to be the most customizable upsell app for Shopify?
[4.02.25, 3:48:26] ~ Austin: Primarily post purchase

[4.02.25, 5:20:05] ~ Guy Edan: When you duplicate a campaign to scale, do you turn off the initial one?
[4.02.25, 5:41:49] ~ Jacob: no
[4.02.25, 5:42:11] ~ Jacob: how you scale if turn off the initial one
[4.02.25, 5:42:50] ~ Jacob: you raise the budget of the original by 25%, and duplicate it in the budget before raising in 25%
[4.02.25, 5:43:02] ~ Jacob: and than you almost raised the budget in 100%
[4.02.25, 5:43:22] ~ Jacob: and if it's going really well so you can even duplicate it 3-6 times a day and monitor it carefuly
[4.02.25, 5:43:31] ~ Jacob: so you raise budget by 300-600%
[4.02.25, 5:44:55] ~ Guy Edan: To clarify: 
We had a test ad we ran at $40 and it killed, than we duplicated with $100 budget, still high ROAS, now duplicated again with $200 and going well, so unsure if to turn of the $100 one, but from what  understanding from you, I should leave it on
[4.02.25, 5:45:22] ~ Jacob: of course, everything thats profitable you leave
[4.02.25, 5:45:26] ~ Jacob: facebook likes a lot of ads
[4.02.25, 5:45:39] ~ Guy Edan: Thanks 🤙🏼
[4.02.25, 5:45:59] ~ Jacob: i personaly dont like this way of duplication of 100 and 200
[4.02.25, 5:46:10] ~ Jacob: i prefer to duplicate just more in more reserved budget
[4.02.25, 5:46:41] ~ Jacob: i prefet to have 5-6 duplication than 2 of 100/200
[4.02.25, 5:47:12] ~ Guy Edan: Makes sense. Thanks bro
[4.02.25, 5:47:39] ~ Jacob: תן בראש

[4.02.25, 18:38:10] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah ASC+ are absolute 🔥
[4.02.25, 18:38:36] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: By far the best performing campaigns once you find winners
[4.02.25, 18:38:49] Sina Bagheri: Above 9% with that but abos give me 5%
[4.02.25, 18:38:59] Sina Bagheri: If that’s the case I can scale this shit to the moon
[4.02.25, 18:39:10] Sina Bagheri: Cvrs
[4.02.25, 18:39:13] ~ L: how many winner ads you usually want to have before start testing ASC+?
[4.02.25, 18:39:16] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah you can dump budget in and they should still work no problem
[4.02.25, 18:39:35] Jordi: I do a minimum of 3... but I think better 5
[4.02.25, 18:39:49] ~ Jacob: Same

[4.02.25, 18:40:08] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Have done well with 2 but 3 is defo better
[4.02.25, 18:40:24] ~ L: but we’re talking about adv+ shopping campaign right?
[4.02.25, 18:40:40] ~ L: cause I’ve heard a lot of people say that at least 15 ads should be in there for it to work
[4.02.25, 18:41:02] ~ Jacob: I talked about a+ audience

[4.02.25, 18:42:24] ~ Jacob: Intersting, u send to webpage or directly shop?

[4.02.25, 18:43:29] ~ Jacob: Strong💪
[4.02.25, 18:43:32] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I’m seriously considering using asc+ for testing campaigns too
[4.02.25, 18:43:45] ~ Jacob: U mean product page yeah?
[4.02.25, 18:43:49] ~ Jacob: By landing page
[4.02.25, 18:43:51] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: If you know what your customer wants you’d be highly like to do well
[4.02.25, 18:43:56] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah bro
[4.02.25, 18:44:00] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Straight to product page

[4.02.25, 18:46:01] Jordi: Yea thanks for sharing!
[4.02.25, 18:46:03] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Make sure you put your winners from an Abo in tjere. Start at 100 dollars per day for around 2,3 days then multiply. Credit here is to Serhii
[4.02.25, 18:46:24] Jordi: Increase by 100%?
[4.02.25, 18:46:32] ~ Jacob: Yeah yeah thats what i always do , take winners from abo
[4.02.25, 18:46:38] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: What audience size or countries are you targeting?
[4.02.25, 18:46:56] ~ Jacob: 3/4 mil
[4.02.25, 18:47:14] ~ L: do you notice ads to die fast in ASC+?
[4.02.25, 18:47:43] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I followed exactly what Serhii told me he said once you find a winning asc you multiply that campaign by 3 then 5x the budget. Launch at midnight and as soon as 1 of those campaigns get a sale, cut the rest
[4.02.25, 18:47:50] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: It has worked like an absolute dream for me
[4.02.25, 18:48:30] ~ Jacob: Aggressive
[4.02.25, 18:48:38] ~ Jacob: Need to have some balls for that
[4.02.25, 18:48:39] ~ Jacob: Hehe
[4.02.25, 18:49:16] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: You could always double the budget and see how you get on to be safe
[4.02.25, 18:49:41] ~ Jacob: Yeah i prefer the more reserved way usualy
[4.02.25, 18:49:50] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: For now 😉
[4.02.25, 18:49:54] ~ Jacob: Haha

[5.02.25, 3:15:48] ~ Mo: thats literally what works for me too bro , when scaling only bumpin up the budget right, do u surf scale ? duplicate winning campaigns ?
[5.02.25, 3:20:04] ~ Fabian: Same here, you can get incredible high roas just by doing this

This + spark ads
[5.02.25, 3:24:06] ~ Fabian: Double the budget thru the day every time you see more purchases then normal stop at maximum 5k per cbo

Then go back to normal budget 100$ 00:00

Copy the campaign + make a new pixel for this campaign, so the next day you start with 2 campaigns

Then you double the budget thru the day on both campaigns

3rd day you have 3 campaigns and so on…
[5.02.25, 3:25:32] Tommy: So you make a new pixel for each campaign? Any specific reason?
[5.02.25, 3:28:22] ~ Fabian: Not sure if it’s outdated but the idea is to get beginner traffic = better traffic 

So the pros is better traffic

And there is no cons

Because you won’t get better results because your pixel gets data on TikTok

TikTok already know your customers so well, collecting data in pixel is almost worthless

The new pixels I created for new campaigns was not even connected to the store

And  the OVERALL roas do not decrease ‎<This message was edited>
[5.02.25, 3:29:47] ~ Fabian: - the only TT pixel I connected was the first one , ONLY because I wanted data on the testing
- ⁠When scaling my pixels where not connected

[5.02.25, 3:53:07] ~ Dayu Yang: It’s 10% additional on top of existing tariffs.

Bigger issue is they are removing de minimis exception though.
[5.02.25, 3:54:16] ~ Dayu Yang: Here’s our initial announcement to ecommops clients (note especially #3) -

We sent out the following statement to all of our clients
*Important UPDATED Notice for fulfillment for 2/5*1. Due to changes to tariff rates and the elimination of the de minimus exemption, for orders to the USA starting today carriers will pre-collect 30% of the declared value to cover custom duties. Our current default declared value is at 5 USD per unit and 10 USD for more than 1 unit in an order. Some products (such as clothing and textiles) have higher tariffs so the difference will be debited or credited after customs applies the final calculated rates based on HTS codes. This will update and reflect in the Google Sheet ‘Order History’ tab.2. If you already have HTS codes and COGS values for your SKUs please share with us, otherwise we will apply default HTS codes and default COGS. Our default HTS classifications are based on product SKU category and type characteristics. COGS we will default declare at 5 USD for single unit orders and 10 USD for multiunit orders. 3. Each order will be subject to an additional carrier processing charge of 2.74 USD (20 RMB) per order.  Our advice is to pause US fulfillment on Wed 05th Feb as fees and transit times may change.We understand some orders can't wait any longer and they have to be sent out. Please confirm to us that you agree with the above new fees. Without clear approval we will hold China fulfillment to the USA.
[5.02.25, 3:56:24] ~ Dayu Yang: That is yunexpress / 4px or similar. Smaller couriers might not be catching up yet on how to handle and I would 100% avoid for now. Esp if you have backed up CNY orders that all risk getting stuck if they don’t clear customs correctly
[5.02.25, 4:33:43] ~ Farhat Godil: Thoughts on this

[5.02.25, 5:07:12] ~ Dayu Yang: basically epacket / china post can’t be used at all currently, as well as any other cheaper lines that depend on the UPU. 

This does NOT impact couriers like yunexpress that organize air freight first and then direct inject
[5.02.25, 5:13:28] ~ Farhat Godil: Good to know. Thank you. But doesn’t yunexpress uses usps as last mile?
[5.02.25, 5:15:08] ~ Dayu Yang: yes, but they direct inject. Ie air freight to the US first, goes through customs like any other air freight, and then once it gets to usps theres nothing to do with customs at all

The usps suspension is specifically on international inbound postal

[5.02.25, 16:54:41] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah I’m using marketplace to source products and put through orders so they adjust the price accordingly I think around 10%. My supplier told me today ‎<This message was edited>
[5.02.25, 16:58:03] ~ JULIUS: Yess +$2.75 + 30% of declared value of the parcel. Otherwise parcels may get stuck and if not paid lost
[5.02.25, 17:08:34] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hey man so how are you working this with your supplier/shipping method?
[5.02.25, 17:14:09] ~ Natasha Iris: Hi Dorn payments call is canceled today since I’m traveling. If you have questions on a specific need feel free to DM me
[5.02.25, 17:14:43] ~ Natasha Iris: If they do I can help with that 😅
[5.02.25, 17:15:46] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Haha thanks in the meantime I’ll continue to send payments daily to my acc and hope for the best lol
[5.02.25, 17:17:51] ~ JULIUS: From what I can see, 1 of the options to work around this would be to ship from EU warehouses or bulk import to US warehouse to reduce the fees
[5.02.25, 17:18:33] ~ Natasha Iris: We have a new direct contact for PayPal US EU division, partnered with our team. Easy release🙏🏼
[5.02.25, 17:18:41] ~ JULIUS: If you're in this position to be able to do that, you will probably be able to make some big banks as other dropshippers will have to scale down during this small window of uncertainty
[5.02.25, 17:19:16] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: In all honestly my supplier is on Ali express he did mention that there will be an extra 10% on the platform
[5.02.25, 17:19:31] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Not sure the agreement they have with US govt which is making me a bit weary
[5.02.25, 17:21:42] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: They have tonnes of stock and for me it’s easier to use the platform. Would you recommend using another fulfilment process? ‎<This message was edited>

When for example you have a fashion store with men's and women's clothes 

When you launch ad on Facebook for men's and for
Women's, can I use same pixel ? Or I should use different pixels ?
[5.02.25, 18:53:21] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I don't think it's a good idea to change the pixel just because is targeting a different gender. Just segment for that gender in different campaigns

[6.02.25, 0:35:48] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hey bro. If it’s to connect the pixel, I recommend using WeTracked, as it’s more effective in tracking events, and you don’t even need that app. I suppose 90% of the people in this group use it. ‎<This message was edited>

[6.02.25, 0:58:06] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I don’t know, I’ve never used it. But yes, Triple Whale is also one of the solutions.
[6.02.25, 1:16:32] Matán Intsuper: I use converge

[6.02.25, 8:57:25] ~ Aatu: Hi, Guys 

Those selling to USA have you continued selling and operations normal or?
[6.02.25, 9:35:55] ~ Bestfulfill—william: hi guys regarding the tariffs between USA and China
1: the new law file trump signed is just president order，it needs law procedures to authorize and then comply.

2: many companies like yunexpress and 4px precharge customs clearance fees of $3 per order + 30-45% percent of (product value), is just to prepare the possible taxes change, it will be returned if a deal done between china and USA

3: the taxes are on product value, not your selling price. so possible cost raise up will be like 1-2 dollars, means if u bought the produce at $1 then its only 20 cents extra charge possible occurs in worst scenario.

4:it affects both bulk orders and small parcels 

Important!!!!!
 the new customs clearance method changed into T11 from T86.
Important. The first batch of yunexpress and 4px line has successfully customs cleared 

So nothing big to worry about so far, 

We both know trump is a business man and everything between business can be negotiated. And china and USA are both working on that, we have 100% confidence on this, so guys please rest assured and just
[6.02.25, 9:39:11] ~ Bestfulfill—william: just wait  fo our updates
[6.02.25, 9:57:43] ~ Mohammed-amine: Hey guys,

[6.02.25, 10:35:34] Jordi: When you have 6 adsets that have been profitable consistently and today they all went down... do you turn them off or let them run? My cpc doubled on all of them are around 20-30usd spend and have a cpc of over 2.5usd and no sales.

Would u turn them off today and turn them back on tomorrow or just discard them ?

[6.02.25, 10:37:44] Jordi: Depends... some 30usd some 100usd
[6.02.25, 10:38:36] Jordi: The ones from 30usd only spend like 13usd but they have a cpc of 3usd+
[6.02.25, 10:40:06] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I might have or two that dip for a day but if the rest are performing I’d leave them on and they’d catch up the next day. Happened yesterday had one at 0.3 ROAS for the day and today so far it’s at 6ROAS. I guess it’s up to you if you wanted to see how they perform throughout the day.

Maybe let them run for a few hours and see how they are. ‎<This message was edited>

[6.02.25, 14:17:04] Jordi: Yea exactly
[6.02.25, 14:17:23] Jordi: So do u cut the same way when teating creatives? Like same SOP rules?
[6.02.25, 14:23:34] Jordi: When reached BE CPA without a sale turn off? Or do u give it a bit more space?
[6.02.25, 14:24:55] ~ Jacob: in creatives it's depend...in creatives i look at more metrics
[6.02.25, 14:25:31] ~ Jacob: for example if i see creatives with a checkout price that is far beyond my account average, ill cut them fast
[6.02.25, 14:26:00] ~ Jacob: but with creative testing im a little more patient
[6.02.25, 14:26:37] ~ Jacob: like if you account average for checkout price is 2-3$ and you have creative with 7-8$ , the chances it will be a winner are low
[6.02.25, 14:26:54] ~ Jacob: of if it's spend for example 15$ on creative without checkout, usually ill cut it to
[6.02.25, 14:27:01] ~ Jacob: the learning phase is bullshit
[6.02.25, 14:27:06] ~ Jacob: if something performs, it performs
[6.02.25, 14:27:16] ~ Jacob: especially in more old accounts
[6.02.25, 14:30:16] Jordi: Interesting! Thanks for that Jacob
[6.02.25, 14:33:24] ~ Jacob: to be honest i even dont know about my CPA, i dont care about it, so far looking at the checkout price has been more valuable to me, but i guess it's less true for new accounts
[6.02.25, 14:34:42] Jordi: Hmmm interesting! I look at CPA as I have a high LTV
[6.02.25, 14:34:53] Jordi: I have many returning cusotmers
[6.02.25, 14:35:27] ~ Jacob: your CPA including the average time customer stays with u?
[6.02.25, 14:35:44] ~ Jacob: i mean the amount of purchases he will make
[6.02.25, 14:36:37] Jordi: No I dont look at that to be honest
[6.02.25, 14:37:16] Jordi: But the problem is that some people buy 1, 2 or 3 pieces… so If i look at my ROAS of people buying 1 item it looks low but in the end they always come back and buy more so thats why i only look at CPA
[6.02.25, 15:27:03] Topi: Whats your go to review app for shopify and why?

[6.02.25, 16:08:33] ~ Jacob: Hey everyone
I recently set up a Hong Kong company (in August last year) and started using Airwallex. They’re holding about 38% of my payments for 30 days, (reserve) which makes it really hard to scale and manage cash flow. I’m looking for a credit solution that I can repay once the funds are released, but it’s tough because most options don’t support Hong Kong entities.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or knows of any suitable credit solutions, I’d really appreciate your advice. ‎<This message was edited>

[7.02.25, 9:35:31] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Updates on USA tariffs!!!

the $3 each parcel cost customs clearance fee is fixed if Using T11 way of customs clerance,

important more and more company like yunepxress and yanwen are charging less like $1.5 per order extra because they use traditional B2b business custom clearance ways, bulk sending the parcels prepacked and then change usps labels from USA warehouse. 

the transtional 1-2 weeks from the USA tariffs will be tough, so our suggestion is get the orders shipped no matter how. 

 we have 4 possible ways to solve this, 

1: prepack ourselves and ship by dhl or fedex way. and then transfer it to usps from our USA warehouse
2: use lines like yunexpress or yanwen, which is roughly $2 higher with taxes included 
3: air cargo shipping to USA warehouse and ship from there. (light items)
4: container shipping to USA warehouse and ship from there. (heavy stuff)
[7.02.25, 9:51:48] ~ Dayu Yang: to clarify, yunexpress is charging 20 rmb (~$2.75 USD) per order, as is 4px. Yanwen is the one charging less, as low as 10rmb ($1.37 USD). 

All of these three couriers are using t11 informal clearance. Main difference is that Yanwen is attempting to combine parcels together and declare as one, which personally I think is risky.

These costs are all based on the formal minimum MPF https://www.help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1128?language=en_US

"MPF for informal entries has a set fee and can range from $2.62, $7.85 or $11.78 per shipment.” $2.62 is a bit less than $2.75 of course, but given exchange rate fluctuations its more or less just a buffer. 

In addition, I advise everyone be very careful to declare value too low. There is a lot of uncertainty if this is legitimate and there are already anecdotal news (but not substantiated) that US customs is already noticing a high volume of low value declarations. 

Our VIP rep at yunexpress is strongly cautioning us against doing this, and that they are urgently working on more clarification.

[7.02.25, 9:54:22] ~ Bestfulfill—william: u didnt get updated yet with the new offer,so talk with your representative more
[7.02.25, 10:18:25] ~ Dayu Yang: Are you responding to my note on yunexpress cautioning everyone to be careful on declaring too low? That is not in line with their official stance. 

As for the customs fee - T11 informal entry is a fixed rate and currently the most efficient / least risky method per parcel. Anything else at the moment is uncertain / risky / way too slow. Yes i do know many smaller couriers are offering lower fees / lower duty rates but I wouldn’t trust their stability right now esp if you have backlogged CNY orders.
[7.02.25, 10:27:54] ~ Bestfulfill—william: to clarify, yunexpress is charging 20 rmb (~$2.75 USD) per order, ---yunexpress  have DDP ways with 10 RMB and taxes included lines already, if u didnt get this offer means u are not on the list yet.
[7.02.25, 10:33:42] ~ Mohammed-amine: Anyone using GTM server side tracking for Meta ads? have you seen a difference in performance between it and the normal Conversion API?
[7.02.25, 10:38:07] Jordi: In the company I code for they do around 3.5mil a week and we do use GTM for conversion tracking
[7.02.25, 10:38:26] Jordi: But in my own I havent tried ti set it up yet
[7.02.25, 10:39:28] ~ Mohammed-amine: Got it
[7.02.25, 10:39:42] ~ Mohammed-amine: Did you have the normal pixel configuration turned off?
[7.02.25, 10:39:52] ~ Mohammed-amine: Or you are using both at the same time
[7.02.25, 10:41:19] Jordi: Nop we removed the normal pixel
[7.02.25, 10:41:35] Jordi: I can double check our codebase
[7.02.25, 10:42:56] Jordi: Hmm I see the code is still present, but I remember they telling me they are not using any of that data
[7.02.25, 10:44:45] ~ Mohammed-amine: I see
[7.02.25, 10:45:00] ~ Mohammed-amine: We are using both and ads manager showing double the sales lol
[7.02.25, 10:45:18] ~ Mohammed-amine: I guess we need to turn off the normal pixel integration
[7.02.25, 10:46:21] Jordi: Yea you should
[7.02.25, 10:46:34] Jordi: I mean the extra sales gives a nice confidence boost hahaha
[7.02.25, 10:49:15] ~ Mohammed-amine: yeah
[7.02.25, 10:49:21] ~ Mohammed-amine: but it messes up ads manager data
[7.02.25, 10:49:33] ~ Mohammed-amine: facebook thinks he is doing good so it stops performing
[7.02.25, 10:52:32] ~ Dayu Yang: on the list for that line, still negotiating final cost and to evaluate its efficiency / risk before offering it. Though will need to do the analysis how worthwhile it is, as it could be more expensive net vs t11 method
[7.02.25, 10:53:17] Jordi: I was just kidding 😅
[7.02.25, 11:40:26] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Take your time
[7.02.25, 15:32:36] ~ Sonu Duhra: @⁨~Kevin Krieg⁩ the smart campaigns worked really good until I increased the budget by 20%, since then bad performance. Do you see this a lot and do you suggest to scale by duplication?

[7.02.25, 17:41:21] Sina Bagheri: 2.4/2.8
[7.02.25, 17:41:29] ~ Jacob: Its not good for scale
[7.02.25, 17:41:34] ~ Jacob: Because it will drop

[7.02.25, 17:43:17] ~ Jacob: And see how it goes
[7.02.25, 17:44:22] ~ Jacob: And also try to learn from it, why it work and create more variations
[7.02.25, 17:44:37] ~ Jacob: Maybe other variation will be more profitable
[7.02.25, 17:50:45] Sina Bagheri: Perfect, thanks Jacob
[7.02.25, 17:52:50] ~ Jacob: Sure, good luck 🔥
[7.02.25, 18:58:54] ~ Facundo: guys a very specific one:

any fb insider that can verify/change stuff on WhatsApp manager 

We do quite a lot of support via wpp but problem is that the wpp name matches the company name and not the brand name so this generates some confusion… want to see if an insider can modify that

[7.02.25, 21:00:38] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Cheers man yeah read some of it alright any one experiencing delays? ‎<This message was edited>

[7.02.25, 21:33:54] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: So great news?
[7.02.25, 21:36:10] ~ Mike Ramsey: For the time being - there was no way that the de minimis removal could get implemented at the snap of a finger.  Was already creating massive issues and delays.
[7.02.25, 21:40:17] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: 100%, fingers crossed it goes back to normal soon
[7.02.25, 21:49:51] ~ marek bednar: U cant just say dont scale anything 4+ roas

BE matters as well

2.8 roas at 1.3 be is better than 4 roas at 2 be
[7.02.25, 21:55:23] ~ Jacob: I can say that thats my standarts
[7.02.25, 21:56:09] ~ Jacob: But i guess its also depend in which roas you are profitable
[7.02.25, 21:56:19] ~ Jacob: For me its not worth it below 2
[7.02.25, 21:57:08] ~ marek bednar: Id say @⁨Sina Bagheri⁩ just focus on creatives + cro (aov, cr)

2.8 is a solid sign

Might not be super scalable but is a clear indication of potential
[7.02.25, 21:58:58] ~ Mohammed-amine: @⁨~marek bednar⁩ Any thoughts on Native's potential compared to fb?
[7.02.25, 22:00:16] ~ Jacob: What u mean in BE?
[7.02.25, 22:00:26] ~ Jacob: Didnt undertstand that
[7.02.25, 22:01:36] ~ Calvin: Breakeven
[7.02.25, 22:04:15] ~ Jacob: It's interesting how many people actually profitable in 1.5, it's very hard to do that in today reality
[7.02.25, 22:04:57] ~ RS: Im profitable with 1.3 😀 Depends on your margins
[7.02.25, 22:05:05] ~ Jacob: really
[7.02.25, 22:05:20] ~ Jacob: so there is work to be done haha
[7.02.25, 22:11:16] ~ marek bednar: All comes down to your COGS % and other fees structured l
[7.02.25, 22:13:27] ~ F: ‎~ F joined using a group link.
[7.02.25, 22:16:13] Sina Bagheri: I’m actually exactly at 1.3 be
[7.02.25, 22:16:48] Sina Bagheri: Absolutely, will do
[7.02.25, 22:19:01] ~ Jacob: ah so it much better :)
[7.02.25, 22:30:55] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Its good news in the sense that you can take more time to prepare for the removal of de minimus. I suggest to everyone to make sure that they know their HTS codes so that they’re paying optimized duties and tariffs when it does become officially removed.
[8.02.25, 0:19:09] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Cheers mate
[8.02.25, 2:09:26] ~ Dayu Yang: All good to go for the time being! 🙌

Various lawyers have just confirmed. Will send more updates as we confirm the movement of packages at customs once china logisitics start getting direct news
[8.02.25, 2:34:57] ~ Dayu Yang: 🚨 TRUMP DELAYS DE MINIMIS ORDER 🚨

It's true everyone, 

Article from reuters: https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-signs-order-delaying-tariffs-de-minimis-imports-china-2025-02-07/ 

And most importantly, the official white house update:

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/amendment-to-duties-addressing-the-synthetic-opioid-supply-chain-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china/ 

"  Section 1.  Amendment.  Regarding the Executive Order of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), the following shall replace subsection (g) of section 2:
     “(g)  Duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 is available for otherwise eligible covered articles described in subsection (a) of this section, but shall cease to be available for such articles upon notification by the Secretary of Commerce to the President that adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue applicable pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for covered articles otherwise eligible for de minimis treatment.”"

Basically legal speak for delaying the recent order for the elimination of the de minimis exemption for China. 

HOWEVER, still clearly leaving the option to implement it formally once systems are in place. 

For now we should be in the clear. But will need to update later once we fully confirm smooth customs processing later in the day. Given the backlog at customs we STILL expect a certain amount of delays regardless of this announcement.

And keep in mind that this does NOT mean the order is cancelled, only delayed. So we still strongly advise taking the appropriate actions to prepare. 

For the time being though, a big breath of relief for DTC parcel fulfillment from China. 

For those who have pre-paid customs fees for existing parcels wondering how you will get refunded back. For now the mechanism is not clear, but we will find out asap. 

Update more when we have more information.
[8.02.25, 3:26:27] ~ Dayu Yang: Our couriers just confirmed all packages sent out today will not apply the customs fee + duty.

Still waiting confirm details on packages already on the way
[8.02.25, 4:58:14] ~ Dayu Yang: Epacket officially resume full service to the US as well (so Hawaii and Alaska are back)

[8.02.25, 12:53:00] Jordi: Thanks
[8.02.25, 16:12:07] ~ L: Guys any of you has a proven Product page framework to share?
[8.02.25, 19:56:02] ~ JULIUS: Check his content to get inspiration from: https://x.com/youssefecom?s=21&t=56GPUkhb6GFLhrL1dhLDmQ
[8.02.25, 19:56:26] ~ JULIUS: Unfortunately there are no one fits all product page or any page framework
[8.02.25, 19:58:16] Carlos Leeseman: Anyone running successfully running advertorials through Shopify? What is the best app for this? Pagefly, Gempages or Replo?
[8.02.25, 19:59:29] ~ Filip: Gempages bro imo
[8.02.25, 19:59:42] ~ JULIUS: Me personally didn't try yet but from what I've seen in industry it's mostly advertised with Gempages or Replo (for higher end-tier) if you decide to go for Shopify adv
[8.02.25, 20:01:31] ~ Num: Hi everyone! For those working in the New Zealand and Australia markets, which payment methods are commonly used?

[8.02.25, 21:18:38] ~ Joel Cederlund: Many of suppliers inc my have EU warehouses for fast shipping in eu. But think it’s a bit more expensive
[8.02.25, 22:10:09] ~ Allan L: Anybody else experience their own ads but in a very different language? I've seen my own ads in EU appear but with arabic language and showcasing another store's products as a catalog under the ad
[8.02.25, 23:48:29] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Never bro do you have advantage+ creative on?
[8.02.25, 23:51:45] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Anyone have an idea on what amount of revenue is hit in a day before Shopify payments gets flagged and they start to review accounts? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.02.25, 23:54:27] ~ Allan L: No. Also language translation is off. 
Saw it on another ad Yesterday as well. 
My wife also noticed some of my ads with another wierd language.
[9.02.25, 0:00:54] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Replo works really well for me. And now they stated to implement analytics too, so you can compare the performance of each advertorial
[9.02.25, 1:25:18] ~ Farhat Godil: How do you guys avoid getting detected by competition specially the winning products finding app. 2-3 days after I launch a product i see that some winning app picks it up and my store starts getting tons of visit from that app
[9.02.25, 1:26:47] Topi: I dont think its possible to avoid this
‎[9.02.25, 1:29:10] ~ Jacob: ‎audio omitted
‎[9.02.25, 1:32:10] ~ Jacob: ‎audio omitted
[9.02.25, 1:38:20] ~ Farhat Godil: The problem is whenever I am launching something I get picked up by winning apps and few days it results in DMCA from someone :(
[9.02.25, 1:38:27] ~ Farhat Godil: Even after editing the images
[9.02.25, 1:39:13] Topi: I think you know the solution to fix this already @⁨~Farhat Godil⁩
[9.02.25, 1:43:08] ~ Jacob: you have 2 options in my opinion:

1.) You can try to find less strict market and smaller market where the chances of someone dmca you and actually care are smaller

2.) If you want to stay in your current market you need to up your level and be more original even if it's take more time

that's all that really to do honestly
[9.02.25, 1:44:01] ~ Allan L: As in you “borrowing” their content and they DMCA you?
[9.02.25, 1:44:24] ~ Farhat Godil: pictures are from alibaba
[9.02.25, 1:44:30] ~ Farhat Godil: so its not their's specifically
[9.02.25, 1:44:41] ~ Jacob: it's not exactly true
[9.02.25, 1:44:44] ~ Jacob: Alibaba copy a lot from brands
[9.02.25, 1:44:51] ~ Allan L: Alibaba and aliexpress steal a lot
[9.02.25, 1:44:51] ~ Jacob: so you cannot really know
[9.02.25, 1:44:55] ~ Jacob: yeah
[9.02.25, 1:45:03] ~ Farhat Godil: Yeah but brands I get DMCA from are not the true owners just dropshippers
[9.02.25, 1:45:31] ~ Allan L: If you are sure about that, just counter it?
[9.02.25, 1:45:55] ~ Farhat Godil: I do that but still product stays suspended for 14 days unfortunately
[9.02.25, 1:45:56] ~ Jacob: and DMCA them back
[9.02.25, 1:46:01] ~ Jacob: if it's jsut dropshippers
[9.02.25, 1:46:09] ~ Allan L: Atleast if you are profitable its worth fighting for
[9.02.25, 1:48:27] ~ Jacob: If you're constantly getting picked up by product-scouting apps (like Ecomhunt, Pexda, Minea, or other "winning product" finders), and it leads to fake DMCA takedowns from other dropshippers, you need to protect your store and product visibility strategically.

How to Avoid Detection by Winning Product Apps
These apps scan for trending products by scraping ad data, sales trends, and Shopify stores. Here’s how you can stay under the radar:

1. Mask Your Store from Scrapers
Block Common Scrapers & Spy Tools
Add bot-blocking code to your robots.txt file or use apps like:

Traffic Guard (Shopify app)
Shopify Protect
Blocky: Fraud Country Blocker
These prevent unwanted bots and competitors from analyzing your site.

Disable Shopify Theme Detection
Many tools identify winning stores through Shopify theme detectors. Use an app like Booster Theme Cloaker or modify your theme settings to remove theme-related footprints.

2. Launch in Stealth Mode
Use Password-Protected Pages for Testing
Before going live, test your ads with a hidden, password-protected page to see how they perform.

Run Ads in Less Scrutinized Regions First
Most "winning product" tools scan US, UK, and major European countries. Test your ads in Brazil, Mexico, UAE, or South Korea before scaling in high-competition markets.

Avoid Using Shopify Payments Directly
Many scrapers target Shopify Payment users. Using an external processor (Stripe, Payoneer, or a private gateway) can make it harder for these apps to detect your store.

3. Prevent Competitors from Reverse-Engineering Your Ads
Use Cloaking for Facebook & Google Ads
If you’re running paid ads, competitors can easily copy your campaigns. Tools like TrafficArmor or RedTrack can help cloak your landing pages, making it harder for ad spies to track you.

Change Product Names & Descriptions
Scrapers look for common product titles and descriptions. Modify yours to unique, creative names that aren't easy to search.

Pixel Splitting for Retargeting
Instead of retargeting with a Facebook pixel alone, use server-side tracking to prevent Facebook Ad Library from exposing your campaign.

4. Prevent False DMCA Attacks
File a Counter-DMCA Immediately
If you receive a false DMCA from another dropshipper:

Respond with a Counter-Notice via Shopify (if they host your store).
Request Proof of Ownership – Most dropshippers won’t have actual trademarks or patents.
Trademark Your Own Branding – Even a simple logo and brand name trademark can help you fight back.
Use a Different Supplier or Private Label
If the same product is being resold by multiple dropshippers, consider contacting the manufacturer to get a unique version with your logo or packaging.

Diversify Sales Channels
If Shopify becomes a problem, try selling through:

Woocommerce (WordPress)
ClickFunnels (for single-product stores)
A separate marketplace (like Amazon or Etsy, depending on the product)
Final Thoughts
The best way to prevent getting picked up is to be LESS OBVIOUS in the first few days.**
Don't launch in major markets immediately – test in lower-competition regions.
Consider switching to a different store platform if Shopify visibility becomes a constant issue.
Fight false DMCAs by gathering supplier proof and registering your branding.

Make a csv file with name, title, body and stars and put all the reviews from the screenshot in the csv file

[11.02.25, 1:19:57] ~ David B: Hey guys. 

You've probably heard hundreds of copywriters banging on about using "Benefits" not "Features" in your copy... 

The problem is that none of them really tell you what that means! 

Tomorrow at 10am EST, 3PM UK time, I'm going to fix that by teaching you my million-dollar strategy for describing your product in a way that makes people ACTUALLY WANT TO BUY IT. 

I'll also share the power of "SO WHAT?!"

Join me tomorrow to get the skills that make you sales go up and to the right. 

PS: If you want your copy critiqued on the call or you have any questions about copy, I'm here to help.
[11.02.25, 2:50:39] ~ Farhat Godil: Any referrals for a person who can make animated video with images?
[11.02.25, 4:19:35] ~ Austin: Check out funneling help pages the instructions are very detailed and help a lot
[11.02.25, 4:31:09] ~ seth: hi guys, we're currently facing some challenges with our Meta ads performance. Since January, we've noticed an unusually high CPC in our account, along with a decline in funnel performance.

Our hypothesis is that Meta's recent update regarding the supplement business might have impacted our pixel tracking. To test this, we created a new pixel and launched ads on a different product page.

We're running a $500/day test with two separate campaigns, same creative, each using a different pixel. Here are the results so far:

🔴 Old Pixel
CPM: $80
CPC: $3.36
CPATC: $20

🟢 New Pixel
CPM: $30
CPC: $0.20
CPATC: $10
[11.02.25, 4:31:47] ~ seth: anyone facing the same problem? How would you recommend for this situation?
[11.02.25, 4:41:36] Matán Intsuper: Well seems like you solved it no?
[11.02.25, 4:42:05] Matán Intsuper: Have you tried a different ad account?
[11.02.25, 4:52:23] ~ Ислам: What do you mean different product page ? Same product but different angle ?
[11.02.25, 4:52:47] ~ Ислам: I am facing high cpm right now
[11.02.25, 5:07:23] ~ seth: no it's just result in the first day we'll need to give it more time.
[11.02.25, 5:08:07] ~ seth: different product page but same everything, I isolate this test for our pixel hypothesis only
[11.02.25, 5:16:47] ~ Steph: Does anyone have any US supplement manufacturers you can connect me with?
[11.02.25, 5:43:19] ~ Mo: for your employees working on hourly basis, what tools u guys using for time tracking ?

[11.02.25, 9:13:53] Jordi: Wooow
[11.02.25, 11:14:50] ~ Jeremy Leppink: interesting, beginning of January our cpc shot up 80% overnight, didn't really recover. Ill give this a shot as well
[11.02.25, 11:26:40] ~ Mo: thank you
[11.02.25, 14:01:58] Radek: We’ve conducted this test too with 1:1 funnel just compliant with new policies and for us CPMs as well as CPAs were more expensive in new compliant funnel. on new domain and new pixel. However with more data and ad engagement both metrics are getting better and almost at the original level.
[11.02.25, 14:02:41] ~ L: so what do you think ultimately was the problem?

[12.02.25, 7:00:39] ~ Kim Romanov: Thanks
[12.02.25, 7:43:49] ~ Mikael: anyone got any good tips. The funnel landing page have 70%+ CVR into the checkout but then checkout is underperforming with About 7% cvr. (Total funnel CVR sales 1.5%)

The price is just below the competition so its not too high. and the price per bundle is alot better than competition. Alot of customer Reviews and testimonials on the checkout (the market for this funnel is sweden)
[12.02.25, 8:38:13] Carlos Leeseman: What is your price point? And you probably don’t show a price on the sales page, so then it’s normal to have a low CVR on checkout page. 7% is not that bad actually. But with some tests you can boost it to 10% for sure ‎<This message was edited>

[12.02.25, 15:43:21] Carlos Leeseman: Question for anyone doing subscriptions….

How do you guys do this with payment & fulfilment? The recurring payment is every 30 days, so the new order only comes through in Shopify once we receive the recurring payment. As a result, it takes 5-8 days for the customer to receive her/his new stock, because the shipping, leaving them without stock for a few days, which is not the intention with our product. 

How do you solve this?
[12.02.25, 16:10:04] ~ Mohammed-amine: how do you make sure the order automatically goes to shopify once he is billed?
[12.02.25, 16:16:19] Carlos Leeseman: Funnelish automation
[12.02.25, 16:16:52] Jordi: Isnt that the same time it took them to receive the first order? So ending up almost on the same?

And can u not make the subscription start after 25 days the first month and after every 30days?
[12.02.25, 16:17:21] Carlos Leeseman: It’s not fair for the customer to bill every 3 weeks
[12.02.25, 16:32:21] Jordi: I mean only the first time
[12.02.25, 16:32:43] Jordi: I have many subscriptions that charge me before I signed up
[12.02.25, 16:57:02] Carlos Leeseman: Yes but then it’s ok to wait, because it’s the first time. But after they start with taking supplements every day, you don’t want them to quit for x days. They need to use consistent every day
[12.02.25, 17:00:09] Jordi: Well if they ordered the 15th and received the supplements the 20th

The second order u will charge them the 5th and they will receive the supplements the 10th but they still have from last month until the 20th.

So they will from now on always have 10 days of stock when receiving the new supplements if u keep charging them on the 5th ‎<This message was edited>

[14.02.25, 7:45:12] ~ Ислам: Hey everyone, I need your advice on scaling with Facebook Ads.

I’ve been running a brand in the baby & mom niche for over a year now, using a product page flow sales approach. My main challenge has been scaling Facebook Ads while maintaining growth.

Here’s the issue:

When I keep my budget low (around $500/day), my ROAS stays strong (around 3-4).

However, every time I increase the budget, my ROAS drops significantly.

I’ve tested duplicating campaigns, but they just end up competing against each other in the auction, which also hurts performance.

The only campaign type that works for me is Advantage+ Shopping—other structures perform very poorly.

One idea I’m considering is running ads from a different ad account to see if that helps.

Has anyone tried this approach? Could it help with scaling without hurting ROAS?


I’ve been struggling with this for a year now. How do you scale effectively without killing performance? How can I drive more site traffic from Facebook without ROAS crashing?

Would really appreciate any insights from those who have figured this out!

Thanks in advance!
[14.02.25, 7:53:55] ~ Mo: Roas always goes down as u scale, i would focus more on backend, increasing your aov, ltv, upsells, crossells, emails, CR… ‎<This message was edited>
[14.02.25, 8:08:15] Carlos Leeseman: What is your break even ROAS?
[14.02.25, 8:08:33] ~ Ислам: About 1.4
[14.02.25, 8:09:11] Carlos Leeseman: So what is the problem if you scale your ads and do ROAS 2/2.5?
[14.02.25, 8:09:53] Carlos Leeseman: Spending few k per day with ROAS 2/2.5 is better then spending €500 with ROAS 3/4
[14.02.25, 8:10:03] ~ Ислам: But if i scale it drops significantly
[14.02.25, 8:10:07] Carlos Leeseman: ROAS always drops when scaling
[14.02.25, 8:10:22] Carlos Leeseman: How much?
[14.02.25, 8:10:42] ~ Ислам: Les then 2
[14.02.25, 8:11:18] Carlos Leeseman: When do you scale them? After much spend? And do you use post ID?
[14.02.25, 8:13:51] ~ Ислам: It is very different, I tried scaling fast and after a month, it is the same
[14.02.25, 8:14:04] ~ Ислам: Yes i use post id
[14.02.25, 8:14:41] Carlos Leeseman: In what market are you running?
[14.02.25, 8:14:56] ~ Ислам: Usa
[14.02.25, 8:16:12] Carlos Leeseman: Okay, big market. Hmm interesting. Put your top 5 winning ads in a ASC+ campaign with your target CPA as cost cap ‎<This message was edited>
[14.02.25, 8:16:30] Carlos Leeseman: Let me know how that goes!
[14.02.25, 8:17:44] ~ Ислам: Thanks for advice 🙏  I really appreciate it
[14.02.25, 9:14:05] ~ Daniel: We’ve had the same issue for some time. I would advise you to increase creative output.

Create more ads using new hooks and angles, and make variations on your winning ads. 

Put these ads in a ABO campaign with 1 ad per adset with $30 budget, and let them spend until 3x target cpa.

From there you can scale, kill and put winning ad id’s in a new cbo campaign.

Meta really likes new creatives. So testing a lot will help you, and you will find new winning ads

[14.02.25, 11:33:02] ~ Sonu Duhra: Anyone here from Europe with HK company?
[14.02.25, 11:34:07] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Why are people using HK companies instead of LLCs?
[14.02.25, 11:34:56] ~ Sonu Duhra: It is a LLC or what do you mean?
[14.02.25, 11:35:10] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Sorry a US LLC
[14.02.25, 11:38:31] ~ Sonu Duhra: Because of foreign sourced income, you cant sell in US if your company is in US if you want tax exempt. Correct me if I’m wrong
[14.02.25, 11:40:22] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I think if you have operations within US then you need to pay tax but if you’re a non resident with no feet on the ground in the US your exempt, as far as I’m aware
[14.02.25, 11:41:21] ~ Sonu Duhra: For HK I know that if your HK company does not sell to HK customers you pay 0% income tax
[14.02.25, 11:41:43] ~ Sonu Duhra: And no warehousing
[14.02.25, 11:41:55] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Interesting it’s such a minefield 🤣
[14.02.25, 11:42:07] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Still trying to figure it all out
[14.02.25, 11:48:36] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Does anyine still have packages stuck at customs in the USA? It seems all my orders between 30th Jan to 3rd February are stuck but anything after 3rd February is going through no problem at all
[14.02.25, 11:49:49] ~ Santi Roa: I just keep it easy, calculate what's your %of COGs on average, and add it as a percentage
[14.02.25, 11:50:06] ~ Santi Roa: Is not 1000% accurate but you can check it and refine it monthly

For an Austrian company I need a UK VAT number asap (sub 7 days). 

Does anyone have a recommendation?
[14.02.25, 21:40:12] ~ Alexander: I’m looking for a new app to use maybe someone can help. I’d like to post on our Instagram and Facebook page automatically using the shopify feed. Basically say to the App post and create stories using photos of our products automatically 2 times a day. We have high quality pics for each product so basically any is good. Most of the app are scheduling app, meaning you need manually to schedule your post. I’d like something more automatic AI based on product feed and all pictures available. Let me know if you had experience with any app like that. Many thanks
[15.02.25, 0:18:06] Sina Bagheri: I just got an account unbanned that had been banned for 50 days. CTAs are all Black Friday.

[15.02.25, 0:49:10] ~ Slav: Hey guys 
Could you provide me with your opinion on wetracked and TW

Which one has worked the best for you so far?
Wanna get one of those, but having a struggle do decide which one should I choose.

Thanks! ‎<This message was edited>
[15.02.25, 2:24:50] ~ 🥇: does refund rate play big role for account health in shopify payment?
[15.02.25, 3:02:32] ~ John B: Personally I would lower the budgets. After 50 days you don’t know how they’re going to do. Especially with the cta as Black Friday
[15.02.25, 9:04:06] ~ Sonu Duhra: This is my opinion would like to hear what others have experienced. I have the feeling that all these tracking tools don’t do anything different than the Facebook conversion API. I used wetracked, when I asked them what they do different then Facebooks CAPI, they could not give me a clear answer. Then I used TW for a year, but it was not tracking better or worse then Facebook and I was paying 400usd for it. I think you just need to make sure you have installed the pixel and CAPI correctly and have advanced matching inside Events Manager on (which is off by default) and making sure non of you cookie banners are blocking the pixel (shopify’s own cookie banner does). ‎<This message was edited>
[15.02.25, 9:06:37] ~ Joel Cederlund: I use wetrack and went from like 70-80% right tracking to 90% I haven’t check  these thing u mentioned. But it was horrible before
[15.02.25, 9:28:47] ~ John B: Hey guys, I have a customs designs POD business. Part of our model involves reaching out to the customers through email so they can approve/revise their custom design we make for them. An issue we are running into is a chunk of our emails go to their spam and then they believe that they’ve been scammed or that we are never going to ship it out. This causes a whole slew of problems like bad reviews charge backs etc. Can anyone help us out with some tips on reaching out through SMS? As of now there’s no way for us to force them to give us their phone number and still have permissions through klaviyo to send them texts. We tried requiring it at checkout, but that’s their shipping phone number and it seems klaviyo doesn’t classify it as eligible to send sms to, and that it doesn’t send out messages to phone numbers that didn’t subscribe to the SMS list. If anyone has any advice on how I could reach out to these customers to get their phone number, it would be greatly appreciated
[15.02.25, 9:52:23] ~ RS: Those who sell to EU or UK through funnelish - does funnelish ask 3DS for all transactions? Previously it asked because its mandatory in EU, but now we have noticed that for many payments 3DS is not asked so now card decline rate has increased a lot. And this transaction does not even appear in stripe or Airwallex. It can be only seen in Microsoft clarity. Has anything changed? Why through funnelish it does not ask 3DS for EU countries. @⁨~Y⁩
[15.02.25, 10:04:04] ~ Mo: i have tested both wetreacked and TW, TW is far more accurate and u get instant attribution, ben using them for +2 years no complaints so far.
[15.02.25, 11:00:32] ~ Mikael: Are you running funnelish or shopify? And are you also running google + fb?
[15.02.25, 11:25:59] ~ Mo: im using both, TW for  shopify, wetracked for funnelish ( only because TW doesnt integrate with funnelish) , yes fb but not ggle
[15.02.25, 11:27:53] Jordi: Are u sure? I heard u just need to add some coding to funnelish in order to make TW work. HAven’t tried it myself as I am only doing shopify at the moment
[15.02.25, 11:46:07] ~ Mo: yeah well i added the code etc.. still doesnt work. if anyone made it work id love to know about how
[15.02.25, 11:47:16] Jordi: I can help u to have a look if needed I havent tried it myself but im pretty good with coding
[15.02.25, 11:49:41] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys anyone having an issue with the website through Shopify?
[15.02.25, 11:49:53] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: It’s saying server can’t be found
[15.02.25, 12:02:40] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Think godaddy is down
[15.02.25, 12:07:39] ~ 🥇: Try accessing your store using the default shopify domain. If that works but your custom domain doesn’t, then it’s likely an issue with GoDaddy's servers being down.
[15.02.25, 12:28:19] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Seems godaddy having big issues
[15.02.25, 12:28:30] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Login and access to dns portfolios all down
[15.02.25, 12:28:39] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: So I’m guessing that has something to do with it
[15.02.25, 14:03:04] ~ Y: Can you send me some details of the page stripe account where you are seeing the declines?

[17.02.25, 7:48:34] ~ Austin: *25% CR Difference, how to solve* Hey guys my CR dropped by 25%  I thought it was bad FB health scores? Could be maxing out the market, could be ad fatigue, tested it all. Well last week seen a bad YT review of the product, I seen it was a simple over site on our fulfillment department and the product could easily be swapped, I I reached out via email sent apologies and solutions while also asking him to take it down until he can review a correct product and sent various review locations like Amazon and website to show we have great reputation. He agreed and took it down by next day, not only that but was already saying he was looking forward to mentioning how sincere and responsive the customer service was….LITERALLY OVER NIGHT CR JUMPED 25% !!! Here’s the deal, customers see the ad, want to buy and then research on YT. That’s our only bad review amongst 5-6 good ones but that single review was getting 1-2K views per week from a very small 1k YT channel, bottom line is CONTACT YT CREATERS have them make positive videos and IMMEDIATELY respond to bad ones…that 1-2 week negative review literally cost me between 75-100k revenue by averaging out CR…learned the lesson hopefully that helps you guys as well.

[17.02.25, 10:19:02] Jordi: If so u can inspect your funnelish page and copy the element from the element selector and paste it in chatgpt... it wont be able to solve it wothout that context

[17.02.25, 12:30:34] ~ L: guys we have good ads and good roas (5$ cpa and 4,5 Roas) when testing low budget, but when we try to scale everything’s drops.  

It’s always the ADS in your opinion?

We tried scalling CBO (1 adset 3 ads in it) by 15/20/50 % every good day but can’t make it work - any recommendation?
[17.02.25, 12:31:01] ~ Omar Tayara: How much u spending?
[17.02.25, 12:32:07] ~ Omar Tayara: At scale your ROAS is going to drop so you’ll be making less perfentage wise but more on an absolute value level
[17.02.25, 12:35:15] ~ L: of course, but we’re seeing ads going from 5 roas to 1 Roas when spending 100$ only
[17.02.25, 12:35:39] ~ L: never seen an increase in costs like this
[17.02.25, 12:55:16] ~ Filip: On what time frame you have this 1 ROAS?
[17.02.25, 12:55:33] ~ Filip: How long are you testing new budget before scaling down?
[17.02.25, 13:00:44] ~ L: we’re keeping the same budget for at least 3 days
[17.02.25, 13:04:14] ~ Jacob: Try cbo with 5 duplicated adsets
[17.02.25, 13:04:32] ~ Jacob: One is not enough
[17.02.25, 13:09:11] ~ Jacob: And duplicate those at least 3
[17.02.25, 13:09:33] ~ Jacob: Like 3×cbox5adsets each
[17.02.25, 13:10:52] Jordi: U mean triple duplicate campaigns?
[17.02.25, 13:11:00] ~ Dean Hiotis: Hey guys, I never got to introduce myself, my name is Dean. I’ve been in e-commerce for about 1 year and half, with my partner @⁨~Alexander Soussani⁩ we’ve seen great results but we will see even better results with this killer group💪🏻
[17.02.25, 13:11:07] ~ Jacob: I do
[17.02.25, 13:11:15] Jordi: Interesting
[17.02.25, 13:11:30] ~ Jacob: Because usually on of them perform better than the rest
[17.02.25, 13:11:50] Jordi: And just cbo or ASC?
[17.02.25, 13:12:07] ~ Jacob: Same
[17.02.25, 13:14:31] ~ Jacob: And if what i said didnt work, so your winners are not strong
[17.02.25, 13:15:08] ~ Jacob: After how much spend on "winner" and how much purchases you decided tu put it in cbo?
[17.02.25, 13:17:04] ~ L: 11 sales in ABO testing at 7€ CPA

then sent in CBO Scaling where CPA increased to 23€
[17.02.25, 13:17:59] ~ Jacob: Its not enough data for cbo
[17.02.25, 13:18:10] ~ Jacob: It very little
[17.02.25, 13:18:17] ~ Jacob: Especially in big market
[17.02.25, 13:18:46] ~ L: I’m selling in France . 

How many sales are you waiting for before scaling an ad?
[17.02.25, 13:18:53] ~ Jacob: France is big
[17.02.25, 13:19:01] ~ Jacob: Ill wait at least 50-100
[17.02.25, 13:19:50] ~ L: 50 sales in ABO at low budget before scaling the ad?
Or do you scale the ABO as well?

and why do you wait all those sales😅
[17.02.25, 13:20:12] ~ Jacob: Of course
[17.02.25, 13:20:19] ~ Jacob: Scaling the abo
[17.02.25, 13:20:27] ~ Jacob: If it cannot scale at abo
[17.02.25, 13:20:33] ~ Jacob: Why it would scale qt cbo
[17.02.25, 13:20:35] ~ Jacob: At
[17.02.25, 13:20:51] ~ Alex Hiss: Are you French?
[17.02.25, 13:22:23] Jordi: Would u also triple duplicate the abo or just 20% increase or both?
[17.02.25, 13:22:37] ~ L: no I’m Italian
[17.02.25, 13:22:41] Jordi: And u calculate sales based on all adsets of the abo?
[17.02.25, 13:22:45] ~ Jacob: 25% and duplication x3
[17.02.25, 13:22:56] ~ Alex Hiss: Is your website in French or English?
[17.02.25, 13:23:07] ~ L: french
[17.02.25, 13:24:16] ~ L: so you have 1 CBO with only ads with 50+ sales?
[17.02.25, 13:25:28] ~ Alex Hiss: Personally I scale ads only based on roas over 7 days
[17.02.25, 13:26:20] ~ L: what’s the structure that works for you to scale after you tested the ads?
[17.02.25, 13:28:19] ~ Alex Hiss: Is your adset broad or targeting 1 audience?
[17.02.25, 13:28:27] ~ L: broad
[17.02.25, 13:28:43] ~ Jacob: In your market , yes
[17.02.25, 13:28:49] ~ Alex Hiss: I would duplicated 5-10 times with trying 1 target audience each
[17.02.25, 13:29:25] ~ Alex Hiss: Then put in a CBO the best performing adsets
[17.02.25, 13:30:45] ~ Jacob: Thats why  i said it depend on market size, in smaller markets, this step is not necesary, but in france yes ‎<This message was edited>
[17.02.25, 13:32:00] ~ L: so you test interests?
[17.02.25, 13:32:39] ~ Jacob: In smaller market ill try with 20/25
[17.02.25, 13:33:50] ~ Jacob: And youve seen better result with that aganist scaling based on ammount of sales?
[17.02.25, 13:35:02] ~ Jacob: Age/Intrests/Lookalike if u have
[17.02.25, 13:35:05] ~ Alex Hiss: If your ads have spendings and can be profitable over 7 days, it’s most likely to be profitable long term
[17.02.25, 13:38:11] ~ Jacob: I put more emphasize for ammount of sales, because eventually when u have a lot of sales, facebook have more data points on the creative and more likely to suceed ‎<This message was edited>
[17.02.25, 13:38:24] ~ Jacob: But i guess you can mix both approaches ‎<This message was edited>
[17.02.25, 13:38:44] Jordi: I would do the same as I have a lot of returning customers
[17.02.25, 13:41:58] ~ Alex Hiss: If you have a lot of sales with a 1.2 roas but you’re profitable at 1.7, Facebook will assume that audience is fine because you keep spending while you are not even profitable
[17.02.25, 13:42:41] ~ Jacob: You are right i forget to add lot of sales while being with good roas 😄
[17.02.25, 13:43:07] ~ Jacob: No point in a lot of sales losing money
[17.02.25, 16:55:51] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi all can anyone point me in the direction of hiring someone for customer support? Would fiver or any of those platforms be any good? ‎<This message was edited>
[17.02.25, 17:11:32] Carlos Leeseman: I like UpWork or LinkedIn for this ‎<This message was edited>
[17.02.25, 17:13:08] ~ Mikael: anyone have step by step guide on how to install microsoft clarity on Funnelish?
[17.02.25, 17:18:47] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Cheers mate
[17.02.25, 17:20:15] Jordi: https://community.funnelish.com/t/how-do-i-install-microsoft-clarity-on-my-funnel/4920
[17.02.25, 17:20:31] ~ Mikael: thank you!
[17.02.25, 18:49:06] Fabian: Hey guys is the Google Ads Mastery call happening today?
[17.02.25, 18:50:10] Jordi: It was like 50min ago i think
‎[17.02.25, 18:50:42] Fabian: ‎image omitted
[17.02.25, 18:51:16] Jordi: I think they wait like 10min and if no one joins they stop it
[17.02.25, 18:51:33] Jordi: Thats what ive seen from the recordings 😅
[17.02.25, 18:58:30] ~ Filip: week ago it was on time
[17.02.25, 19:03:39] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, how do you determine if a product is truly saturated? I know there’s no simple yes/no answer, but our data doesn’t show any major decline compared to our best months. We’ve been struggling for months to make it profitable again, while a year ago we were crushing it, even with worse ads. We keep trying to improve, but results just keep getting worse. Has anyone experienced this, and how did you figure out whether it was saturation or something else?

We’re active in a really competitive niche, but we’re the market leader in the main market.
[17.02.25, 19:05:06] ~ Matan: Hi guys nice to text here for the first time!
So I was asking my Chinese suppliers if they have any products that selling well by other clients of their in Israel (my country&market) in the beauty- self care niche and they send me one

Because I have a pretty strong pixel I felt confident to take the same product and make a better version of it with ads and  product page.

That guy is not scaling but constantly selling and running ads from September. And the Chinese says he’s doing good..

My test campaign wasn’t successful at all and barely got sales… even tho I made a better version.

Anybody can give his opinion?
[17.02.25, 19:15:11] ~ V: Hi All. Can Klaviyo be connected to Funnelish? Im using funnelish for my Funnels and Shopify for order processing.
[17.02.25, 19:18:12] Topi: yes, super simple, just google klaviyo + funnelish
‎[17.02.25, 19:47:42] ~ Wouter Akika: ‎image omitted
[17.02.25, 19:51:44] ~ L: Whenever I have huge CPM while testing I change Page, even create a new one - most of the time it fixes the problem 

Last time was December 2024 - CPMs on Page1 were 300$, on Page2 dropped to 80$
[17.02.25, 19:51:47] ~ L: @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩
[17.02.25, 19:54:56] ~ Wouter Akika: Got it!

Thank you brother!

Any other ideas?
[17.02.25, 19:57:03] ~ JULIUS: To add on what @⁨~L⁩ mentioned, I heard that old pages that got flagged with the new FB pages about health niche can experience high CPM and using another page fixed their issue
[17.02.25, 19:57:14] Jordi: I did PM u
[17.02.25, 20:53:07] ~ Ислам: Can please explain what do you mean changing the page ? You mean you just creating new product page on the same website with same product? Is that what you mean ?
[17.02.25, 20:55:34] ~ L: New Facebook page
[17.02.25, 21:12:43] ~ Ислам: Oh thank you, why the Facebook page might be a reason of high cpm ? Because I am also seeing huge cpm like 300$
[17.02.25, 21:17:17] ~ L: From what I’ve been told by an insider on top of feedback score every facebook page has a “Tier Score” that advertiser can’t see and determines weather facebook “trust” or not that page. 

this can be Gold, Silver or Bronze . 

This might be an explanation, but in reality there’s no actual proven reason why. It just worked for me in the past
[17.02.25, 21:19:56] ~ Ислам: I am seeing high cpm in the beginning
[17.02.25, 21:20:13] ~ Ислам: When just launching new page
[17.02.25, 22:06:17] ~ Wouter Akika: Our page is Platinum, so it can not just be the tier in this case, we have that checked every week

The health niche 

Buying comments

Changing page


These all make a ton of sense, thanks guys!
[17.02.25, 22:06:51] ~ Tyler Wood: Where are you buying comments?
[17.02.25, 22:20:14] ~ Wouter Akika: Someone just sent over commenthero, I have not done this before FYI
[18.02.25, 11:16:11] ~ Mikael: How is the market treating you guys atm? And which market do you sell in 💪
[18.02.25, 11:48:57] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys do you need to file a federal tax return before getting an ITIN in the US? They are asking for a form 1040-NR
[18.02.25, 12:10:53] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, is there a way to split test two different domains? I previously used Google Optimize for this. I want to test the exact same funnel on Shopify vs. Funnelish.
[18.02.25, 12:11:25] Carlos Leeseman: With most tools like Intelligems, the domains should be the same
[18.02.25, 13:38:44] ~ Mikael: No I never filed any tax for ITIN
[18.02.25, 13:39:26] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Cheers I think Shopify payments ask for it when setting up in the US
[18.02.25, 15:08:01] ~ Daniel: Hi guys, are you also waiting for the CRO call to start?
[18.02.25, 15:32:12] ~ Facundo: shopify payments asking for ITIN? cant you get away with EIN?
[18.02.25, 15:32:42] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I have an EIN but heard they ask for an ITIN too
[18.02.25, 15:35:00] Jordi: I never gave an itin to shopify payments
[18.02.25, 15:35:36] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: And is your payment processing  based on USA and in USD?
[18.02.25, 15:35:42] Jordi: Yea
[18.02.25, 15:35:55] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thank you for this
[18.02.25, 15:36:07] Jordi: I think I did change it recently to euro but I had it working in usd as well
[18.02.25, 15:36:23] Jordi: My payouts are in usd tho
[18.02.25, 15:36:37] Jordi: Horrible as they pay me less usd than euro 😂
[18.02.25, 15:36:50] Jordi: Their rates for euro to usd are horrible
[18.02.25, 15:37:15] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Do you have US bank account?
[18.02.25, 15:37:55] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I want to get paid into a US bank account with US company and then bill the US company from my Irish company for marketing services.  Keep everything in the US bank account then for taxation purposes
[18.02.25, 15:39:31] ~ Facundo: any bank you would guys recommend? similar to mercury ideally
[18.02.25, 15:54:03] Jordi: Yes i do
[18.02.25, 15:54:32] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Just opened an account with mercury couldn’t find anything else
[18.02.25, 15:54:42] Jordi: Im also using mercury
[18.02.25, 15:54:54] Jordi: Not sure what the issue is with mercury
[18.02.25, 15:55:22] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Are they good for you?
[18.02.25, 15:57:29] ~ Facundo: lot of people got their account down with mercury
[18.02.25, 15:57:40] ~ Facundo: that´s why i am looking for a back up
[18.02.25, 15:58:51] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I heard this too so I’m slow to use them
[18.02.25, 15:59:03] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: They hold onto all the funds as well in some cases
[18.02.25, 16:22:18] ~ Calvin: Relay
[18.02.25, 16:38:00] ~ Facundo: thanks tried with them but they asking for a utility bill from a us address with my name on it
[18.02.25, 16:38:16] ~ Facundo: and im not living in the us so that made it impossible
[18.02.25, 16:41:47] ~ Calvin: I didn't use a utility bill, I used a virtual adress
[18.02.25, 16:53:27] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Are relay good?
[18.02.25, 17:02:56] ~ Bruno Oliveira: I was asked today to fill out a W-9 form for the 1099-K IRS. Did you specifically fill this out? Im not a US citizen ‎<This message was edited>
[18.02.25, 17:06:57] ~ Calvin: I haven't had any issues with them other than taking really long to sign documents and ship them to me
[18.02.25, 17:09:08] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Okay cheers mate going to sign up them as well today
[18.02.25, 17:09:12] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Good to have backups
[18.02.25, 17:09:41] Jordi: Never filled this out
[18.02.25, 17:11:32] ~ Calvin: How long have you had shopify payments? I don't think its necessary if you haven't had it for over a year.

[19.02.25, 9:32:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Whats up legends, got a quick question about tracking (please don't ask me the structure lol):

We are running traffic from tiktok to Website A, here they can add to cart, when they click that the checkout is connected to 2 different stores for the payments (basically it gets split 50/50). 

If i install the same pixel on all 3 stores here, will it track correctly? Or will it only track the events happening on the lander we put in tiktok
[19.02.25, 13:21:40] ~ JULIUS: Any good recommendations for a really good tax/corporate structure contact in e-commerce space?

Videos is loading in way to slow. They are only around 10mb in size.

Lazy load is on ‎<This message was edited>
[19.02.25, 18:38:40] ~ Fabian: Funnelish btw
[19.02.25, 18:39:05] ~ L: 10 mb isn’t very light
[19.02.25, 18:48:30] Fabian: Lazy load is literally lazy loading.. 

So it only starts loading when it’s visible in most cases

Try eager load, make sure your FCP & LCP are good after you switch ‎<This message was edited>
[19.02.25, 18:50:28] Carlos Leeseman: 10MB is a lot. Try to make them GIF file in low size ‎<This message was edited>
[19.02.25, 18:50:44] Carlos Leeseman: Max a few KBs, not MBs
[19.02.25, 18:51:04] Carlos Leeseman: And if you want to show longer videos, use third party apps like Vidalytics
[19.02.25, 18:51:39] ~ Christopher Murphy: What do you guys use for long form VSL landers? ‎<This message was edited>
[19.02.25, 18:51:53] Carlos Leeseman: Vidalytics

[19.02.25, 19:18:20] ~ Reece Mander: Anyone using evergreen webinars? Can you recommend?
[19.02.25, 22:22:14] ~ Calvin: Hi guys, currently facing an issue with Shopify Payments. Registered with an EIN of LLC a year ago but it's now saying personal details couldn't be verified and needs me to update the SSN or ITIN field. 

I have an ITIN on the way but it will only arrive in a months time. Shopify payments says that it will pause payouts tomorrow if I dont update the information or change the personal details of the account representative.

Company is an LLC formed in Wyoming, I'm wondering if I can change the account representative and get someone to enter their SSN/ITIN until I get mine in amonth. I'm just not sure if this will affect their personal tax although I doubt it would because company is formed in Wyoming.

Anybody have an idea if it would not have any negative implications and if when I switch out the ITIN this coming month if the tax reporting would all be under my name? Thinking of asking my supplier to use theirs since we have a working relationship
[19.02.25, 22:54:37] Jordi: Dont u have stripe?
[19.02.25, 22:58:14] ~ Calvin: Only SP
[19.02.25, 23:03:02] Jordi: Ahh damn... i would recommend having more than 1 PSP in case something like this happens
[19.02.25, 23:06:45] ~ Calvin: For sure definitely going to from now on

[19.02.25, 23:52:18] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: If there a few bad comments on your Facebook ad will it hinder performance? I delete them as I go and email the customer to sort out the situation
[19.02.25, 23:53:17] Jordi: I would never delete only hide
[19.02.25, 23:56:40] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Does deleting them affect the performance?
[20.02.25, 0:12:59] Jordi: I heard facebook does not like deleting comments ‎<This message was edited>
[20.02.25, 0:13:32] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah I deleted a few today and I have noticed a dip in performance
[20.02.25, 0:14:24] Jordi: Well i never deleted hahaha so good to know
[20.02.25, 0:14:43] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Time will tell 🤣
[20.02.25, 3:19:01] ~ Luka: Just hide the comments rather than delete
[20.02.25, 4:33:09] ~ Farhat Godil: For people selling Same product in different market do you same pixel or different?
[20.02.25, 4:33:41] ~ Farhat Godil: And just different shopify pages with in translated language for product page and checkout?
[20.02.25, 4:46:31] ~ John B: I’m launching ads in EU soon after only selling in US and I plan on using the same pixel as it’s been warmed for a few months now to my target audience. I don’t see a reason to make an entirely new one especially because my product is pretty niche. Could be wrong though. 🤷
[20.02.25, 4:51:21] ~ Farhat Godil: I am just worried because I plan to do in other languages and not English
[20.02.25, 10:02:57] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thanks Luka
[20.02.25, 10:03:11] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Performance picked up again was probably a shaky few hours
[20.02.25, 10:03:50] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Got word from my supplier that Trump is planning to re introduce the tariffs for April 1st so definitely start getting things in order
[20.02.25, 10:26:53] ~ Mikael: anyone use Wetracked for both Google and FB? We have HUGE miscalculations on roas due to some platform is over reporting. About 30%
[20.02.25, 11:15:29] ~ Mo: bro @⁨~Mikael⁩ , if u not using funnelush then just switch to TW and make ur life easier
[20.02.25, 11:16:16] ~ Mikael: FOr this brand we are only using Shopify with Wetracked. But its not tracking properly
[20.02.25, 11:16:41] ~ Mo: bro use Triplewhale
[20.02.25, 11:16:50] ~ Mo: wetracked sucks blls
[20.02.25, 11:17:22] ~ Mikael: haha, Yeah I just scheduled a meeting with TW later today
[20.02.25, 11:17:45] ~ Mikael: Does TW send data back to Meta with pixel? or how does TW work?
[20.02.25, 11:17:45] ~ Mo: u get 100% attribution instantly + their reporting & key metrics
[20.02.25, 11:17:51] ~ Mo: no no
[20.02.25, 11:18:04] ~ Mo: most of the time i just check TW dashboard
[20.02.25, 11:18:15] ~ Mo: i never check ads manager (if its only for attribution) ‎<This message was edited>
[20.02.25, 11:18:56] ~ Mikael: Because, as Wetracked, its connected to our shopify and it sends back data to Meta and we check the ads manager for results etc.
[20.02.25, 11:19:12] ~ Mikael: but right now. the Roas seems to be all over the Place.
[20.02.25, 11:19:56] ~ Mo: yeah bro it sucks  i tested wetrracked
[20.02.25, 11:20:12] ~ Mo: just switch to TW and thank me later
[20.02.25, 11:20:45] ~ Mo: im using wetracked with funnelush because TW doesnt integrate with funnelish and its a total mess
[20.02.25, 11:29:42] ~ Mikael: okey bro thx! will switch. this is too messed up
[20.02.25, 11:30:08] ~ Mikael: What About keeping Wetracked for Google and triple whale for FB? or would that mess Everything up?
[20.02.25, 11:33:17] ~ Mo: triplewhale track all
[20.02.25, 11:33:19] ~ Mo: everything
[20.02.25, 11:33:33] ~ Mo: all sales channel, email marketing ...
[20.02.25, 11:33:38] ~ Mo: organic
[20.02.25, 11:33:39] ~ Mo: sms
[20.02.25, 11:34:02] ~ Mikael: Yeah im just thinking becase Wetracked helped our Google performance by sending back data to Google. this made our Google performance more stable
[20.02.25, 11:35:06] ~ Mo: i think TW does same, most big brands that i know using TW , for a reason i think
[20.02.25, 11:35:26] ~ seth: why need wetracked for GG can you tell me more?
[20.02.25, 11:36:43] ~ Mikael: I dont know if you need, But for us Wetracked helped the performance of google by sending back data to Google. so GOogle got more data than just by itself
[20.02.25, 12:17:25] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Whatsup guys.

Is it possible to pull the live URL from a tiktok ad through my own ads manager? I only see the preview URL. Need to know for the parameters for my developer, cant seem to find it
[20.02.25, 12:18:38] ~ Allan L: Preview urls dont normally show parameters.
[20.02.25, 12:19:10] ~ Jeremy Leppink: indeed, thats why i need the live one, but with tiktok i cant get the link to the live ad basically
[20.02.25, 12:20:51] ~ Allan L: But dont you set the parameters on your own on TikTok as well?
[20.02.25, 12:21:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: It does it automatically
[20.02.25, 12:21:58] ~ Allan L: You should be able to add dynamic utms tho
[20.02.25, 12:24:23] ~ Jeremy Leppink: yes possible, i can set them up myself as well. Developer is asking for a live URL to the store coming from the ad so he can check the behaviour. Its all through woocommerce and tracking there is horrible, also de store has a really weird setup
[20.02.25, 16:13:09] ~ Salman: ‎~ Salman joined using a group link.
[20.02.25, 16:19:15] ~ Slav: Hey guys!
Does anybody know anything about dynamic meta pixel?

I'm trying to do it on my Shopify store, but having some issues with getting it to work on a Thank you page.

Is there anybody who can help with it? ‎<This message was edited>
[20.02.25, 16:33:32] ~ Mo: Guys like seriously there is no alternative to wetracked for funnelish ? Its slow not accurate and they keep playing the same story on repeat «  we send the data back to ads manager, then its up to fb etc… » . Anyone made triple whale work with funnelish ?

[20.02.25, 18:12:48] ~ John B: Anyone know how my sessions could be nearly 50% lower than my clicks on meta ads? I assume my tracking is messed up somehow but not sure where I at. I use we tracked.

[20.02.25, 19:11:10] ~ Salman: This has been happening to us, but in PK and I thought it’s due to certain internet disruptions and low internet that the drop off rate between clicks and website visits is different
[20.02.25, 19:14:56] ~ Salman: Also,

Just wanted to introduce myself.

Became a part of this community today! 

I’m Salman, originally from Pakistan, but have lived in UK and UAE for a good amount of time..

Founded an ecommerce company that had multiple businesses, but exited all to focus on one (Manto: www.shopmanto.com) which Alhamdulillah grew to be one of the fastest growing fashion brands in the region! 

Since last 6 months we’ve been trying to go global, and in those efforts I became a part of this group.

We now have 4 retail stores and a team of 143 people in Pakistan. Hoping to learn from the community and scale it sustainably:) ‎<This message was edited>
[20.02.25, 19:15:25] ~ John B: Yeah I’m not quite sure. Our store has been acting very weird. Yesterday we had 50% more sessions than the previous day and today we have 75% less than yesterday but our conversion rate is up from 1.8% to 4.0%
[20.02.25, 19:17:18] ~ John B: Welcome to the community. That’s inspiring
[20.02.25, 19:28:18] Jordi: Awesome man! Welcome to the team! 🥳
[20.02.25, 19:34:48] Matán Intsuper: something similar happening here
[20.02.25, 20:37:05] ~ Denys: Hi, will there be a call with Alex today?
[20.02.25, 20:37:58] ~ Daniel: Hi guys, anyone who can recommend a great native German copywriter?
[20.02.25, 20:46:00] Carlos Leeseman: Not sure if this is the answer you’re looking for, but this is how we do it:

We ALWAYS write all of our copy in English. This is easier, faster, cheaper, etc. As soon as our copy is finished, we translate it with ChatGPT to formal German/Dutch at 5th grade level, which makes sure that 90% of it is already good. Then our native proofreader goes over it to make sure it is 100% correct. This way saves you a lot of time and money.

[20.02.25, 21:37:13] ~ Joel Cederlund: any idea how to fix? scrolling meta ads libary
[20.02.25, 21:39:15] ~ Joel Cederlund: Never gotten this before😅
[20.02.25, 21:39:49] Jordi: Ive seen it multiple times happening to other people hahaha try incognito window
[20.02.25, 21:40:45] ~ John B: you need numerous FB accounts if you want to use it for more than 30 minutes
[20.02.25, 21:41:17] ~ Joel Cederlund: Friend of my told me im banned from meta ads libary. I thougt se was bullshiting. Been useing it for hrs in row Before xD
[20.02.25, 21:41:41] ~ John B: I have about 5 different ones just burners switch between them and you can get nearly 3 hours of consistent use if you’re doing product research or market research
[20.02.25, 21:42:25] ~ Joel Cederlund: Aaah okey thanks
[20.02.25, 21:42:55] ~ John B: I believe it’s based on account not IP but I could be wrong but with what I just said I haven’t had an issue. That’s also what my friend does and he has no issue.
[20.02.25, 21:43:22] ~ Joel Cederlund: Just tried with vpn and it says u need to "log in" to keep watch
[20.02.25, 21:43:32] ~ John B: yeah
[20.02.25, 21:44:09] ~ John B: and I would imagine if you login with your account you were just previously using it would then again say temp banned even though your on a vpn
[20.02.25, 21:44:16] ~ John B: but its worth a shot
[20.02.25, 21:55:32] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys anyone fill out an 1040-NR form for an ITIN? I don’t have agents or warehouses in the US (yet) shipped from China and lands in USA. Do you have to declare your connected income?
[20.02.25, 21:56:47] ~ Reece Mander: Welcome brother! Fantastic work!
[20.02.25, 22:10:14] ~ Natasha Iris: Yes - you need to declare your connected income on the form 1040 even if you’re filing for an ITIN 

This is for tax liability especially if you’re hitting Nexus in certain states. Income from sales of goods outside the US & sold in US are considered ECI (effectively connected income) and taxable.
[20.02.25, 22:11:58] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Is this income taxable?
[20.02.25, 22:12:37] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Also, if anyone can help me fill it out or point me in the right direction I would be very grateful 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[20.02.25, 22:21:58] ~ Natasha Iris: Right - theres a lot of factors to this and you should get with a tax professional 

But rule of thumb if your income is “connected” to engaging in trade within the US it’s taxable because of ECI. Regardless that you’re a non-resident 

Even if you’re not hitting Nexus in certain states. You still have federal income tax
[20.02.25, 22:23:24] ~ Natasha Iris: But there’s a lot of different factors the IRS will look at when you get your ITIN and start engaging in sales
[20.02.25, 22:23:27] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I spoke to a tax expert from Bright!Tax and they said as long as I dont have a dependant agent working for me in the US my business won’t create ECI
[20.02.25, 22:24:21] ~ Natasha Iris: Perfect - don’t hold stock within the US either. So you don’t trigger this as well
[20.02.25, 22:25:54] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thank you for your help
[20.02.25, 22:26:00] ~ V: Hey guys having some trouble with facebook pixel. when i test it it onle fires up on page views but not when i get to checkout and put payment info on my funnelish checkout.. any suggestions how to fix this issue?
[20.02.25, 22:34:53] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: @⁨~Natasha Iris⁩ if my supplier rented a warehouse in the US and I put orders through them would this count as ECI. They are based in China themselves.
[20.02.25, 22:34:58] ~ Guy Edan: Is anyone’s else ads manager not working?
[20.02.25, 23:03:31] ~ Natasha Iris: Great question - I’d shoot that to your guy at Bright. But do the traditional fulfillment and shipping from china. Keep the product out of the US warehouse and you should be fine
[20.02.25, 23:04:06] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Will do thank you!
[21.02.25, 4:50:05] ~ Justin: Are there some benchmark conversion rates for funnels? I have a listicle > product page > checkout > thank you page. Just wondering what sort of conversion rates I should be aiming for. Built on funnelish. Thanks!
[21.02.25, 5:24:01] Matán Intsuper: around 50%-50%-25% is good
[21.02.25, 5:26:06] ~ Justin: Awesome, thanks! Currently at 45%-38%-10%. Looks like the checkout page needs some work.
[21.02.25, 5:30:14] Matán Intsuper: depends on your price, but yes, in some checkouts i reach 25%+ so its possible
[21.02.25, 5:30:39] ~ Justin: AOV is around $40 atm
‎[21.02.25, 5:38:49] Matán Intsuper: ‎image omitted

Us market?

[21.02.25, 6:09:24] ~ John B: Has anyone seen this before? Last night I cut around 10% of my ads because I launched 100+ within 2 days and some weren’t doing well. My sessions dropped by 80% today but my conv rate went up 550%. I didn’t cut nearly enough ads for the 80% decrease in sessions to make sense and I’m not complaining my conv rate went up but it doesn’t seem normal at all/ I’ve never seen something like this so curious as to what you guys think. Preciate anything. 🤝

[21.02.25, 8:46:05] ~ Mo: hey guys, i got TW to finally work with funnelish. it tracks 100% & attribution is immediate. if anyone had same issue let me know i can help.
[21.02.25, 8:50:21] ~ P: hey, it is better of wetracked? I use that on funnelish
[21.02.25, 8:50:49] ~ Mo: yes its way better, i tested both
[21.02.25, 8:52:21] Jordi: Also to the adsmanager??
[21.02.25, 8:52:31] Jordi: Instant attribution to the adsmanager?
[21.02.25, 8:53:02] ~ Mo: i dont check the ads manager for attribution
[21.02.25, 8:53:06] ~ Mo: i check only TW
[21.02.25, 8:54:03] ~ Mo: they have their own attribution dash for all channels
[21.02.25, 14:57:20] ~ V: if a facebook ad account is banned does it affect other ad accounts connected to the same personal fb account?
[21.02.25, 15:06:18] ~ Filip: No
[21.02.25, 16:42:08] ~ Cocow😈: If I may , there is a lot of time confusion between TW and wetracked. 

Triple whale = attribution tool which means it tells you the road and other stuff based on their algorithm and attribution ways. You can see your sells for every touch point where a client comes from and get an idea of how the revenue come from. You can have an AI attribution splitting (with post purchase survey) , last click, first click, splitted by every touch point and so on. This can help you as you could see blended roas for every channel and avoid the countless overlapping of every channel because everyone one to get the attribution. 

Example: a client click on meta ad, goes on google via shopping , and then buy via Klaviyo. Everyone will take the credit and TW tells you what drove mostly the sale, you can as well split the revenue of the sell by 3 , and other attribution systems. 

Everything is mostly triggered bi UTMs via social media plateforms and emails and then for organic search it detects. A client is identified by multiple parameters so that TW can track their journey. 

TW can help you as well to calculate your profit , have kpis, dashboards and so on 


For we tracked( or Bily, or Elevar for example) , this is a CAPI. 

The only job they do is by server , they provide the events back to your Meta, Google ADS, and other plateforms to feed the algorithm
 
In my opinion you should run with both. One to feed the plateforms, and other one to have better visibility on your blended roas. Some brands actually manage the ads with TW because it avoids the overlapping (at least better than meta and google campaign manager) 

Important: TW has developed in 2024 a CAPI AS WELL like we tracked, its name is sonar. I do not know if they connect with funnelish but this is certainly something you can ask them ! 

Hope this clarifies :))
[21.02.25, 16:43:57] ~ Mikael: Perfect bro thx for the information. yes I decided to go with both For now. Just integrated Triple whale this morning and kept Wetracked for now to send the data back (even tho I saw that Triple whale have their own program called SONAR, that sends back data to Meta)
[21.02.25, 16:44:34] ~ Mikael: Our biggest problem have been the attribution of sales. so I hope triple whale will help with this.
[21.02.25, 16:50:07] ~ Cocow😈: By the way , hi everyone and hope your are doing well :) 

I joined ESS two days ago and will introduce my self :) 

My name is Marco and I live in Switzerland. I started ecommerce in 2019 and while working i created a brand that started in 2021 and is now in the French , and German market , and launching soon in UK. 

I stopped my job October 2024 and are now 100% on ecom.

Joined ESS because I was facing a lack of motivation so needed guidance to scale and , because I have to implement funnel strategies in order to boost profitability. 

I have never done advertorials and I am in the health niche so I really wanted to master this as I think this will lead me to other levels. 

I am really happy to be onboard and hope I can give value as much I will get (at least to my best to help with my skills🤣). 

Thanks in advance for all your tips and happy scaling for you ! 🚀
[21.02.25, 16:50:37] ~ Reece Mander: welcome!
[21.02.25, 16:51:43] ~ Cocow😈: Because you have too much overlap between the platforms ? 

Will the sells from funnelish going into TW or you will have to check separately ?
[21.02.25, 16:51:52] Jordi: Welcome Marco! Nice to have u!
[21.02.25, 16:51:53] ~ Cocow😈: Thanks :)
[21.02.25, 16:52:03] ~ Cocow😈: Thank you man !
[21.02.25, 17:14:40] ~ Mikael: On this brand I am not using funnelish. its just shopify, google and Meta
[21.02.25, 17:18:19] ~ Cocow😈: Ah ok got it I mixed up :)
[21.02.25, 18:18:19] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey guys

[21.02.25, 18:18:30] ~ Wouter Akika: I know about chargeback 911
[21.02.25, 18:18:41] ~ Wouter Akika: but what other post authorization / chargeback protection companies do you know of
[21.02.25, 18:18:54] ~ Wouter Akika: looking for real companies that have been around 5y +
[21.02.25, 18:20:03] ~ RS: Chargeflow catches like 99% of MasterCard and visa disputes. 40% Discover and 0% amex
[21.02.25, 18:20:09] ~ RS: From my experience
[21.02.25, 18:20:58] ~ Joel Cederlund: If I win dispute. Dose it still count as a dispute or only lost disputes count?
[21.02.25, 18:21:18] ~ RS: Each counts as dispute
[21.02.25, 19:53:38] ~ Cocow😈: So TW has an integration with funnelish ? Nice ! You just have to put a code on the header of the funnel and then attribution goes into TW ? You were facing issues of tracking with wetracked on adsmanager that was it ? Thanks
[21.02.25, 19:55:57] ~ Cocow😈: Did you launch ads yesterday ? If you are using UTMS this can be on reason but this seems to be another thing. Try to check on your shopify analytics and take the visitor dashboard and check the source so that you can see if you got like bots or whatever
[21.02.25, 20:03:55] ~ John B: I think the UTMs were messing with it as you said. I took them off for now. I’ll check it we were getting bots thank you man

[21.02.25, 21:02:46] ~ John B: I realized I had the wrong utm’s setup for some of the products I was running on the site which may have prevented the sessions from being tracked correctly. Quite frankly i’m still not 100% sure but it seems to be back to normal now.

[22.02.25, 8:26:44] ~ Ислам: Hi everyone

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to reach out to get some insights from the group regarding product testing and Facebook Ads performance.

About a year ago, I launched a brand in the motherhood niche using the Flow product page model, and it has been doing well. Over the past couple of months, I decided to test around ten new products, all of which I carefully selected. However, none of them really took off, and the main issue seemed to be the high ad costs.

Now, here’s where things get interesting. I recently started running ads for my winning brand on a different Facebook ad account. Even though I’m using my proven winning creatives, the results are quite different. The ad costs are lower, but the conversion rate is not as strong as expected.

This leads me to my main question:

1. Does scaling a winning product always require a certain budget burn at the start to "train" the Pixel before seeing strong purchase conversions? In other words, even if we have a proven winning product, do we need to spend a certain amount on ads before the algorithm optimizes properly and starts delivering strong results?


2. How do you structure product validation when testing new products? Given that ad costs can vary significantly, what’s the best approach to determine if a product has real potential?


3. How important is product authenticity in today’s market? Do you still rely on competitor creatives for initial validation, or is it now crucial to create your own custom content from the start to improve conversion and credibility?



I’d really appreciate your thoughts on this! Any advice or experiences you can share would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance!

[22.02.25, 12:14:15] ~ P: Hi all, does anyone know how to bypass this HeyGen problem? Or maybe you can recommend me some other site to generate an AI avatar that doesn't have these limitations. thank you!
[22.02.25, 12:14:33] ~ Cocow😈: hahhaha
[22.02.25, 12:14:36] ~ Cocow😈: Know it
[22.02.25, 12:16:31] ~ Cocow😈: You have some words that are too pushy. Like sciatica and so on this may cause you trouble. What I did is that i tried to change these words with a word that sounds like it , but different meaning. It is a bit different indeed but if it is one word they will likely not see i guess
[22.02.25, 12:17:04] ~ Cocow😈: and then you dub it will elevenlabs to put the good word

[22.02.25, 12:19:06] ~ Cocow😈: Capcut can generate AI avatars as well ? interesting !
[22.02.25, 12:19:28] ~ RS: Yeah, AI UGC. Even better than this heygen 🤮
[22.02.25, 12:20:04] ~ Cocow😈: Are there doctors ? hahhaa 

Or maybe you can prompt them to generate ? Thanks for the tip !
[22.02.25, 12:20:35] ~ RS: There are even better apps for AI UGC that AI onlyfans scammers use 😀 They make very realistic AI videos even from just a photo 😀 ‎<This message was edited>

[22.02.25, 21:30:39] ~ Fabian: 2/21 is really bad, don’t use standard TikTok app on Shopify

Use omega, we tracked or triple whale
[22.02.25, 23:54:02] ~ Facundo: Thanks

[23.02.25, 6:35:27] ~ Ислам: Hey guys 

I need some advice on testing new products and Facebook ads.

I launched a motherhood brand a year ago (Flow-style product page), and it’s been doing well. Recently, I tested 10 new products, but none took off—mostly due to high ad costs.

Now, I tried running ads for my winning product on a different ad account. The ad costs are lower, but conversion is weaker than expected.

My questions:

1. Does a winning product still require a budget burn at the start to "train" the Pixel before getting good purchases?


2. Is it now necessary to create unique content, or can we still test with competitor-style creatives?



Would love to hear your thoughts!
[23.02.25, 8:11:04] ~ K: 2. I got told by Serhii that it’s still fine to still use my ripped content as long as the metrics perform. (Maybe it’s different for you idk)
[23.02.25, 8:31:27] ~ Sonu Duhra: Weaker CVR can be due the lower CPM’s on your new ad account and the new pixel. 
If the creatives and funnel are good, I don’t think there is any need to burn money, I would stick to the testing rules. Something like Serhii shows in his videos. I have seen FB prefers fresh content and performance is better.
[23.02.25, 8:39:30] ~ Ислам: By the way, Serhii in his trainings mostly focus testing on different interests. But I guess thos videos was recorded maybe a year ago. 

But recently as I noticed, interest targeting works not so well, like broad targeting, 

What do you think is it still reasonable to run interests ads following Serhii trainings? Or better just running broad ads ?
[23.02.25, 8:41:03] ~ Sonu Duhra: Try both. And those rules are not just for interest testing but testing in general.
[23.02.25, 10:09:32] ~ Mo: guys i bought a paid theme, and i want to use it for a second store ( same brand, different country) but i got those licencing issues, is there a way to circumvent that ? already reached out to their support because it doesnt make sense to pay twice for same brand.
[23.02.25, 10:10:44] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: If its different store (even though same brand), you should purchase again
[23.02.25, 11:26:29] ~ K: whats the cleanest looking bogo app? To make it look really branded
[23.02.25, 11:39:00] ~ Gedion: Hey man 
Kaching, is the most used one for sure
[23.02.25, 11:39:24] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Best one by far 🚀
[23.02.25, 12:30:03] ~ K: It looks kinda whack don’t you think? For example the shrine pro quantity breaks looks so much more branded but it’s hard to costumize it with specific things
[23.02.25, 12:38:27] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I found the shrine theme pro was too thick and cumbersome it didn’t give me the functionality I wanted where as kaching is nice and sleek you can easily edit the borders, text images etc
[23.02.25, 13:08:16] ~ Dean Hiotis: Hey guys, my customers are sending emails that they need a 6 digit code to purchase my product in the checkout page. 

Is there a way to fix this, I’ve never seen this before.
[23.02.25, 13:08:45] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Do you have the shop app integrated?
[23.02.25, 13:10:04] ~ Dean Hiotis: I do but I changed up my store a bit and now it’s not where it’s supposed to be which is under the add to cart button ‎<This message was edited>
[23.02.25, 13:51:44] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Do you have dynamic checkout on? I never use it and only have shop app at checkout
[23.02.25, 13:52:26] ~ Alexander Soussani: yes we have dynamic checkout on
[23.02.25, 13:52:34] ~ Alexander Soussani: aren’t we supposed to have that on though?
[23.02.25, 13:53:02] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Sorry I meant dynamic buy now buttons on the product page -
[23.02.25, 13:55:38] ~ Alexander Soussani: i don’t think so but how can i can if i do?
[23.02.25, 13:56:18] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I’ve tested it a good few times and having just an atc button with a well optimised cart drawer and then followed by dynamic payment options at checkout works best.

My customers will get the code sent to their phone if they choose shop app but can easily pay with a different method not sure is yours the same.
[23.02.25, 13:58:09] ~ Alexander Soussani: hmm i don’t know id have to check but i dont know how to lol
[23.02.25, 13:58:18] ~ Alexander Soussani: could you tell me how you did so please
[23.02.25, 14:50:21] ~ Alexander Soussani: would just turning off dynamic checkout on the page do that?
[23.02.25, 14:50:44] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Sorry guys just got caught with something there
[23.02.25, 14:51:34] ~ Alexander Soussani: no worries
[23.02.25, 14:52:49] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: So go to shrine theme editor go to the template or product you want to edit. Activate editor - click the dynamic checkout button - edit it then select it to turn off. You should now only see an add to cart button and nothing else
[23.02.25, 14:53:22] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Your dynamic payment options should still be available in checkout but not on the product page - I’m not sure if this will fix your issue but it’s definitely worth trying

[23.02.25, 15:00:04] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: No problem your customers will still get 2FA if they choose PayPal and Shop. I wonder do you have a setting on to get a code sent to their emails instead of their phone numbers id check that as well in settings.
[23.02.25, 15:01:42] ~ Alexander Soussani: i’m pretty sure it’s under customer contact method
[23.02.25, 15:01:48] ~ Alexander Soussani: in the checkout settings
[23.02.25, 15:02:03] ~ Alexander Soussani: you can select email only or sms and email
[23.02.25, 15:02:03] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Can you change that to phone number?

Contacted them, they told that their AI risk checker became stricter for my account because there were some indications that my account can have more fraudulent payments. Started to happen after I received a few chargebacks marked as “fraudulent”. They told me that they cannot Do anything, and I need to process more payments so the AI can learn what are good transactions and what can be fraudulent. After a few more weeks it fixed by itself. But I had this stripe account only attached to my shopify checkout. I ran all my traffic to funnelish where I had different stripe account. I had only a few sales a day in the shopify store from customers that searched us on google. But still it fixed the stripe acc
[26.02.25, 7:58:59] ~ Jake: How is your experience in general with Stripe and droppshipping? I have heard they don’t like it and ban you randomly even if you don’t have many chargebacks
[26.02.25, 8:00:04] ~ RS: Not really dropshipping. Because of them I have some gray hair 😂 If you have a different option, dont use stripe.
[26.02.25, 8:01:15] ~ Jake: What option is that?

So you say don’t use Stripe if you don’t have a 3pl yet?
[26.02.25, 8:05:28] ~ Mikael: Yo fam I got some questions. Ive been testing funnelish but so far I get alot better results with regular shopify Product page. 

Ive tested and got the landing page to perform better. but still very few people purchase. ( I use the nooro template). got up the click trought from landing/Product page to 50-60% to checkout. but then almost no one buys. 

What can the issue be? too pushy? too many Reviews? (I mean shopify checkout is plain and nothing and it converts better)

[26.02.25, 8:09:47] ~ RS: You can still use stripe but you need to be prepared for some payment holds etc, even random account shutdowns.

[27.02.25, 1:44:09] ~ Farhat Godil: Quick question I am thinking of setting up subscription like 15% discount if they subscribe for monthly deliveries but then my AOV is taking a hit because most people buying single quantity.

So is LTV better in long term or AOV cause what if they buy and then cancel subscription
[27.02.25, 2:42:03] ~ Mo: the issue is kinda fixed for me too, yesterday all payments succeeded.  when i set up my new stripe/funnelish account, i placed 2 orders myself that were successful, then all the rest of transactions succeeded.
[27.02.25, 4:23:04] ~ Devesh Jain: Is it possible to run multiple pixels on a website (Shopify store)? 

Has anyone tried and faced any problems? 

(I sell t-shirts to different niches, hence asking. Haven’t tried multiple pixels yet) 

Thanks in advance 😀
[27.02.25, 4:54:28] ~ Farhat Godil: Yes I have been doing that since past 7 years 🙂
[27.02.25, 4:54:44] ~ Farhat Godil: I use trackify to install multiple pixels
[27.02.25, 5:06:54] ~ Ислам: Yesterday I installed omega pixel, have you used that before, which is better? So that means you don't use Facebook app to install pixel ?
[27.02.25, 5:07:30] ~ Farhat Godil: No you will need to remove the Facebook app - or it will track duplicates
[27.02.25, 5:07:42] ~ Farhat Godil: I have never used anything other than trackify
[27.02.25, 5:10:11] ~ Ислам: Actually recently I noticed dropped in conversion when I removed Facebook app. 

I use two Facebook ads account, for first ad account and pixel i use Facebook app 

For the second pixel and ad account i use omega pixel app
[27.02.25, 5:11:09] ~ Ислам: What about your conversion, is it the same like with Facebook app?
[27.02.25, 5:15:08] Jordi: Well improve ur product or post purchase experience and give gifts on the month most people cancel their subscription
[27.02.25, 5:35:02] ~ Farhat Godil: Is price the biggest reason for most abandoned carts? Other than price how can I convince those people to finish purchasing?
[27.02.25, 5:52:17] Sina Bagheri: 1. Unexpected fees (I don’t charge shipping or tax, the price they see when they add to cart is what they pay)
2. ⁠theme switch (obvious, make sure the color theme, fonts and really everything is congruent with your store/funnel) 
3. ⁠credibility (this isn’t a big one, but slapping on a few guarantee badges could help)
[27.02.25, 5:52:19] Jordi: More like unexpected costs
[27.02.25, 5:53:02] ~ Farhat Godil: Nope nothing extra - free shipping and no upsells
[27.02.25, 5:54:16] Sina Bagheri: Loading speed is a big one
[27.02.25, 5:55:25] Sina Bagheri: https://pagespeed.web.dev make sure everything is above 90

[27.02.25, 6:07:58] ~ Farhat Godil: Who did you use to fix the speed?
[27.02.25, 8:34:36] ~ Mo: anyone has Yunexpress shipping rates ( based of weight ) ?

[27.02.25, 13:08:17] Jordi: Welcome 🥳
[27.02.25, 13:33:04] ~ Mikael: Anyone WHOs running Funnelish with AirWallex. Do you run traffic to a domain that is different to your branded landing page? does customers trust this or not?
[27.02.25, 14:32:32] ~ Dean Hiotis: Does anyone know where to get professional editors to do VSL's?
[27.02.25, 14:53:39] ~ Alexander Soussani: and does anyone have a contact for a page builder (super cheap if possible but good at the same time)
[27.02.25, 15:06:37] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, have a conflict of schedule with our content call in 1h. We will move it by 2 hours and do the call at 11am EST (instead of 9am EST).

Will let you know again right before we start as a reminder. Talk later 🙌
[27.02.25, 17:40:14] ~ Jacob: No and irt bad idea
[27.02.25, 17:40:30] ~ Jacob: Airwallex will recognize it
[27.02.25, 17:40:37] ~ Jacob: And its not good
[27.02.25, 17:40:46] ~ Mikael: what do you mean?
[27.02.25, 17:40:59] ~ Jacob: Only use the domain u register with them
[27.02.25, 17:41:23] ~ Jacob: I mean they approve ur branded domain
[27.02.25, 17:41:29] ~ Jacob: Not something else
[27.02.25, 17:41:48] ~ Jacob: Dont try to be smart with them
[27.02.25, 17:42:17] ~ Mikael: yes exactly. this is what I mean. for example:

Registered domain example.com

sub domain on funnelish:
Offer.example.com.

Branded funnelish page, Product name and logo etc: LANORA. 

Ppl think they buy from LANORA, but the domain is example.com
[27.02.25, 17:42:19] ~ Mikael: is this an issue?
[27.02.25, 17:43:01] ~ Jacob: For the sub domain its ok
[27.02.25, 17:43:07] ~ Jacob: If thats the question
[27.02.25, 17:43:29] ~ Mikael: Im asking if its trusted by the customers or if they will jump off the checkout due to missmatch? brand is different than the domain for them?
[27.02.25, 17:44:53] ~ Jacob: Ah no
[27.02.25, 17:44:59] ~ Jacob: Its not important
[27.02.25, 17:45:16] ~ Jacob: Its like u r going to walmart
[27.02.25, 17:45:41] ~ Mikael: okey thats good. because I have a General name with Airwallex. so it would work. but im just looking at the options as so far I have not got my funnels to work better than regular shopify Product pageas
[27.02.25, 17:59:56] ~ Kevin Krieg: Content sourcing call starting in 1 min. Same zoom event as usual. See you there
[27.02.25, 22:35:37] ~ Cocow😈: Hi all everyone has the schedule of the mastermind or I missed something ? 🤣

Cannot wait to be there and meet some of you 🚀
[28.02.25, 2:42:04] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey legends! See you tomorrow at the mastermind event!!! Please hit lucia@ecommercescalingsecrets.com if you have any questions
[28.02.25, 2:42:04] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨Lucia Van⁩
[28.02.25, 4:36:44] ~ Mo: not sure but i think thats the reason why they terminated my account. switched to a new domain and forgot to update it in airwallex, so most probably thats the reason.
[28.02.25, 7:50:01] ~ John B: Hey guys I know this is something that happens in the industry but I wanted to see if anyone had advice. Today I saw that my supplier was openly listing our product on their site. For more explanation, we sell a photo frame… the frame itself is basic but it’s the unique designs that make it do well. In the past, we had agreements they would not share our designs or make listings with our product/ brand designs but today I noticed they did just the opposite. As I mentioned I know this is something that happens in ecom but not sure if it’s enough to change suppliers. We had a good relationship up to this and they even bought the materials to make it themselves rather than sourcing from a factory so we get it for cheaper. Not sure how I should address it and if I should ask for something in return or as “compensation” Fairly new to the game so haven’t had this happen and not sure best way to react.
[28.02.25, 7:53:48] Jordi: Well changing suppliers wont change a thing... they will still sell it. And u might end up with a more expensive product. (Just my first thoughts)
[28.02.25, 7:55:23] ~ John B: Yeah that’s what I thought as well. Overall bad bc it’s harder to trust them (considering they said they wouldn’t share our designs) going forward that they won’t cut corners, go lower on quality without saying anything etc etc
[28.02.25, 7:58:32] China Bigboss: hey as you have good relation with them keep it talk with them to remove it from the site as you already have a deal on this .. if you feel they are not doing what it have to be done you can just move with the product to another agent " did you regitser the desing or its already exist in the market" ?
[28.02.25, 8:02:06] ~ John B: I haven’t registered it. I figured it would be hard to register it as “ours”because art and designs are subjective im not sure how that would work legally.
[28.02.25, 8:05:16] China Bigboss: you can do some small adjustment on the design it self and register so no one any where can sell and you have the right to decide about it and the original mold can be at the warehouse or at your agent office they can use it once you do an orders
[28.02.25, 8:07:25] ~ John B: I’ll look into it for sure. I’m sure that would help down the road if I try to sell it as well.
[28.02.25, 8:11:12] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Actually u can let them hide it as exclusive on their app. But this doesn’t really stop people copying your brands. With so many spy tools in the market there is no secrets. The only thing u can do is scale your business as fast as u can so u can dominate the market faster and give people who copy higher barriers to step into.
[28.02.25, 8:13:53] ~ Bestfulfill—william: or keep trying new designs or new products, i guess u are doing print on demand, this gifting market is so competitive in the market with a lot of vietnam sellers, they basically have like 10k orders per day on so many products with so many designs
[28.02.25, 8:18:42] ~ John B: yeah it’s POD but it’s all custom to order based on what the customer requests. We definitely have the biggest share in the market in the very specific niche we are in. Because it’s all custom per order I knew it would be hard to scale but also a bigger barrier to entry for others. Frankly with my supplier posting it I wasn’t so worried abt competitors than the “disloyalty” it showed
[28.02.25, 8:19:17] ~ John B: and wasn’t sure how to react that’s why I asked here.
[28.02.25, 8:23:29] ~ Bestfulfill—william: its simple .warn them u will change, if they do this again,

[28.02.25, 12:36:20] ~ Dayu Yang: More updates on US China tariffs:

1. 10% additional tariffs just announced (on top of the existing 10% + existing duties). But de minimis elimination is still paused so this doesnt affect DTC parcel shipping
2. ⁠But some good news, Yunexpress’ new DDP line has completed successful testing and is priced quite reasonably at 8rmb extra per kg, with no additional duties or fees. Not publicly available yet (though you shouldnt be using this anyways with de minimis rule still in effect). Unfortunately this line does not support battery or cosmetic products, which they are still working on, but very positive progress on solution if/ when de minimis elimination comes back.

[1.03.25, 2:29:05] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey guys, do you know if it’s possible to link Authorize.net to Checkout.com
[1.03.25, 2:56:29] ~ Mike Ramsey: No - checkout is a full stack solution and you cannot plug into auth.net.

I can confirm with my checkout contacts but I am pretty certain.

But if you are trying to integrate into another CRM or platform leveraging auth.net, checkout is integrated with most so not really a need for auth.net
[1.03.25, 3:15:12] ~ Wouter Akika: It’s because I want to run subs on Shopify
[1.03.25, 3:15:31] ~ Wouter Akika: OrderGroove & Recharge work with Shopify Payments, Stripe & Auth
[1.03.25, 3:15:40] ~ Wouter Akika: The first 2 I don’t trust
[1.03.25, 3:15:44] ~ Wouter Akika: So Looking at how to make Auth work
[1.03.25, 3:26:53] ~ Mike Ramsey: Make sense - there’s lot of providers that can plug into auth.net to run subs.  If you need recommendations feel free to DM.  Some of more friendly for auth rates than others

[1.03.25, 20:44:27] ~ Mikael: Does anyone use pagepilot, persuva or any other AI auto product page generators? Does it work good? Mainly for testing products quickly
[1.03.25, 21:41:18] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Would be keen to know this also
[1.03.25, 23:58:50] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi all does anyone have experience using Revolut for an international business account?
[2.03.25, 2:13:07] ~ Wouter Akika: Thanks for sharing this Mikael
[2.03.25, 3:25:54] ~ Salman: Hello Guys,

We’ve only been using triple whale for our attribution, but I saw some msgs here earlier about wetracked, and ever since I’ve been receiving the ads.
‎[2.03.25, 3:25:59] ~ Salman: ‎image omitted
[2.03.25, 3:26:05] ~ Salman: Does it actually have an impact?
[2.03.25, 4:10:38] ~ Mo: I use TW too, tried wetracked but it wasn’t a good experience for me ( slow to attribute, inaccurate…)
[2.03.25, 5:40:31] ~ Cocow😈: @⁨~Brendan O’ Connell⁩
[2.03.25, 5:40:46] ~ Cocow😈: We had some discussion about :)
[2.03.25, 5:41:16] ~ Cocow😈: Mmmh been using since 2022 with 3 currencies and amazing
[2.03.25, 5:41:40] ~ Cocow😈: As wells relay convenient for reporting because csv export perfect
[2.03.25, 5:42:49] ~ Cocow😈: You can create virtual business cards and give it a name if you want to split between different costs then I’d can help reporting and , you can give access to some credit cards to your team (not been using this however)
[2.03.25, 6:50:34] ~ Mikael: For us, The Facebook Attribute is inaccurate. But for google it helped to stable our performance and be able to scale Google more profitably. As Wetracked sends back more data to the ads platforms than regular pixels. 

Now I just added Triple Whale also and I can see the Meta attribute alot more accurate
[2.03.25, 11:48:54] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thanks man I just got my US account today heard such good reviews about it so excited to try them them out thank you again for getting back to me 🙏
[2.03.25, 12:10:14] ~ Mo: Hey man how u set up ur shipping cost in TW , is it per weight ? ( & do u ship with Yunexpress ? ),
[2.03.25, 12:43:14] ~ Mikael: Any AI platform or similur you guys can recommend for Static ads? Also if video ads also
[2.03.25, 13:54:26] ~ Erik Pecovnik: anyone have experiences with ordering bulk raw materials from china?
[2.03.25, 13:55:49] China Bigboss: Which kind of material?
[2.03.25, 13:56:14] ~ Erik Pecovnik: acrylic glass, and MDF frames for images
[2.03.25, 14:00:40] China Bigboss: Text me on private will ask one of my team to contact you
[2.03.25, 18:48:14] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys anyone spending 5k+ a day i have an asc at 2k a day performing at 3 ROAS would it be okay to 3x the campaign and 4x the budget on a Monday?
[2.03.25, 18:48:38] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Or wait until later in the week
[2.03.25, 20:12:46] ~ Calvin: Have you tried surfing the campaign?
Surfing my asc campaign took it from $2k spend per day to $5k+ pretty quickly

If you increase budget tonight and tomorrow morning goes strong then do small incremental bumps and see how performance is after 3 hours or so to see if you can continue surfing
[2.03.25, 20:13:39] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I have tried bro it works to a point. Duplication is a safe bet for me. Only thing is are Mondays okay to increase?
[2.03.25, 20:13:47] ~ Calvin: I've surfed on a Monday with good performance, other Mondays haven't had the best but it usually stabilizes and performs well next day
[2.03.25, 20:14:00] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Okay thanks man I’ll give it a go
[2.03.25, 20:14:23] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I’ll defo try surf scaling again during the week maybe I didn’t have enough data
[2.03.25, 20:23:41] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Do you usually increase at midnight?
[2.03.25, 20:23:49] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: And then again in the morning?
[2.03.25, 20:34:46] ~ Calvin: Yeah usually 20% at midnight then if around 9am it still solid I'd usually try a small incremental bump and check performance 3 hours later
[2.03.25, 20:35:22] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Cheers 🚀
[3.03.25, 5:33:40] ~ John B: Does anyone have a good system they could share for getting consistent trust pilot reviews as well as more picture reviews on the site? Right now we get a lot of reviews on our main site but rarely with pictures. I’ve seen people give 5$ amazon gift cards if they leave a picture review but does anyone have a flow of some kind setup for picture/ trust pilot reviews?
[3.03.25, 5:37:13] ~ Reece Mander: I use loox and I think it rewards them more for photo reviews. Seems to work well
[3.03.25, 5:37:15] ~ Bestfulfill—william: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1if4tpn4O756QrIbetOfaKS0OrnP2-UGgi5DNDHV1qEU/edit?tab=t.0 my speak content about tarrifs.
[3.03.25, 8:02:30] ~ Jake: Does anyone have an Ireland company and pays for Facebook, Google ads?

Do you have to pay VAT on every transaction.

Like when you spend 1000€ on ads it charges you 1230€ (23% VAT)

Thinking of getting one for EU that’s why I am asking
[3.03.25, 8:26:02] ~ Mo: any tools/apps to track time for freelancers ( something like upwork where you see what they doing with their time …) ?
[3.03.25, 8:42:28] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨~Alex⁩ any thoughts on this
[3.03.25, 8:45:31] ~ Mukhtar: Yes you get extra charges in every Facebook transaction.
[3.03.25, 8:48:43] ~ Jake: That is only for Ireland in the EU right?

All the other countries don’t get charged right?

Cause of reverse charge
[3.03.25, 12:39:58] ~ Marko: Does ESS have a google ads partner or can anyone recommend an agency?
[3.03.25, 12:53:36] ~ Bestfulfill—william: We have Google agency
[3.03.25, 12:53:45] ~ Alex: Yeah VAT gets charged since Meta & Google are based in Ireland

You need to use agency accounts 

@⁨~Bestfulfill—william⁩ is the best for those
[3.03.25, 12:56:11] ~ Jake: Got it! Thanks a lot!

Any recommendations for company setup or things to watch out to get accepted by Shopify payments and PayPal?

Office needed? Or only nominee director?

Also is it possible to get an Amex for the Ireland ltd?
[3.03.25, 12:56:42] ~ Marko: as in, it’s yours or you know a good one?
[3.03.25, 13:11:01] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Ours
[3.03.25, 13:18:16] ~ Alex: Address needed but it can be a virtual one. Some accountants will use theirs if you get them to set the company up 

Nominee director is fine just be transparent 

I’d use an accountants address rather than a virtual one that may have flagged addresses for PayPal/SP

Nah there’s no AMEX in Ireland
[3.03.25, 13:57:02] ~ P: Hi everyone, I have created a subscription order on Funnelish, but the product delivery is on Shopify. Do you know how to manage subscriptions between Funnelish and Shopify? Currently I have put automation on Funnelish, with the trigger ‘Recurring Payment’ and this according to support, should then simply create a new order on Shopify for each subscription renewal. Does anyone have any experience with this?
I would also need to understand how to get customers to then manage the subscription, like creating a special area on the site.
Thanks!

[3.03.25, 14:28:44] ~ Alexander Soussani: i actually have the same question lol
[3.03.25, 14:29:45] ~ Jake: Sounds good!

Are there any other credit cards accesible in Ireland with Ecom?

Also what do you mean with be transparent?
[3.03.25, 14:31:10] ~ Mo: yeah man been trying to figure this out for ages,  i have a lot of SKUs combinations, so shipping cost in my reporting is never accurate. The actual shipping cost per weight in TW dont make much sense to me.
[3.03.25, 14:31:51] ~ L: Guys anyone noticing super high ROAS today? 

It’s 1,30pm for the ad account it spent less than 50% of the daily budget and we have like 7 roas so far
[3.03.25, 14:36:34] ~ Cocow😈: Heard about timestamp ‎<This message was edited>
[3.03.25, 14:38:26] ~ Mo: i’ll check it out thanks mate !
[3.03.25, 14:43:03] ~ Cocow😈: They have a few capabilities 

- You can try to do weight costs 
- ⁠you can put the shipping cost from the checkout as this cost
- ⁠you can import via csv the shipping costs of your orders 

Depending on how your agent invoices you , you can see maybe patterns of prices by weight and country 


When I was doing Yunexpress there was always like: 

- fee fix per order 
- ⁠weight fee 

If you are capable of finding this fixed fee , setup a fixed fee by order , then get your cost per weight to figure out price per gramm. or you can cheat a bit and put the weight fee per sku in the cost of the product 


In my case I made estimation based on weight and import csv by order when I want 

So accurate perfectly when you import and then during the week or your month it is not 100%

You can as well if you want I think but a fixed fee per order and sku in triple whale , to avoid changing the cost and analyse correctly cogs and shipping ‎<This message was edited>
[3.03.25, 14:53:01] ~ Mo: Thats what im trying to do too. Yunexpress shipping cost are= $12.5*weight(kg)+$3.4 . So in this case id add the “$3.4” as fixed fee per order right as u said , but then i still have the “$12.5* weight”, how do u set this up in TW ?
‎[3.03.25, 14:56:08] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
[3.03.25, 14:56:09] ~ K: i have the exact opposite. had 3.5 roas yesterday which went to 0
[3.03.25, 15:00:10] ~ Mo: Can i dm bro ?
[3.03.25, 15:00:23] ~ Cocow😈: Clear feel free
[3.03.25, 15:01:23] ~ Mo: alright thanks man ! just dmed
[3.03.25, 15:02:11] ~ Cocow😈: This is the shitty part in fact, as they do not have weight*price calculation. I would advise to talk to their support because the could help or even develop in the coming weeks/months
‎[3.03.25, 15:08:49] ~ Cocow😈: ‎image omitted
[3.03.25, 15:09:07] ~ Cocow😈: And the fixed fee per order in the shipping, I would try this. Yes all manually ...
[3.03.25, 15:23:11] ~ Alexander Soussani: and what if we’re using a bundle app how can you track that and add cog prices for that?
[3.03.25, 15:37:06] ~ Cocow😈: Does your bundle app splits the skus at checkout or you create your bundles based on sku ? 

Example bundle of 1 lamp and 2 tables

Result of the order is : 

1 bundle so sku for all - lampx1tablex2 

Or your order has 

Lamp x1 
Table x1 
Table x1


Case 1: as it is sku based it means you have a separated product so import it costs on triple whale 

Case 2: what I sent should work 

Make the setting and check on the next orders to control :)
[3.03.25, 15:38:41] ~ Cocow😈: It is not perfect but this can be a good option to have an idea every day. The best would be to import every week for example the shipping fees by order for 100% accuracy

[4.03.25, 13:42:48] ~ Jacob: Hi guys if you had a strong campaign that perform well in the last 4 days - but comes a weak day in the week, and the roas drops to point it's not profitable, and half of day has passed and it's losing, will you cut this campaign and turn it on the next day?
[4.03.25, 13:52:51] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I’d let it run for the rest of the day if you can afford to and if it’s not performing by like 10am the next day I’d cut it

[4.03.25, 22:46:28] ~ Patrycja: Hi everyone, does anyone have a template when it comes to asking people to leave a review? Do you have any metrics of what % of the customers should leave a review? 

(Few months ago we started getting less reviews from people- they get the basics email from judge me and a % off)
[5.03.25, 6:03:16] ~ Jeb: I’m interested in this as well if anyone knows best practices to get customers to make reviews through email
[5.03.25, 6:07:06] ~ John B: (my personal opinioin) but I wouldn’t overthink something like this too much. If you deliver value to the customer and they get the desired result you sold them on they will happily write a review when they get a request. If you sell something like a skin care tool or serum, maybe you can delay the review request from judgeme by an additional x amount of days… so they can see more results before they leave a review.
[5.03.25, 6:07:51] ~ John B: Or they will be more inclined to leave a review if they have seen more results^ which may increase the # you get.
[5.03.25, 9:59:41] ~ Cocow😈: If you work with loox, they integrate with Klaviyo and you can AB test your flow of email requests. Generally, the shorter e-mail the best in my case. But I am thinking switiching to loox native mails because another market from the same brand does not have klaviyo and we have quite a lot of review coming. I think these tools work hard on having the best review email and they surely constantly ab test and improve
[5.03.25, 11:06:51] ~ Alessandro: Hi guys 
I’ve opened a stripe account a week ago

[5.03.25, 11:57:34] ~ RS: Happened to me. It asked selfie later
[5.03.25, 11:58:00] ~ Alessandro: How many days later?
[5.03.25, 11:59:17] ~ RS: Maybe weeks or months even. I think I opened it in the begining of october and it asked for selfie in the begining of november. But it was not my main acc so sales were slow. I think i used  it for one of my geo funnels

How do you do it efficiently?

Is it something you still take care even tho it seems facebook isn’t updating it anymore?
[6.03.25, 13:59:06] ~ Filip: i dont care about it
[6.03.25, 14:00:01] ~ Filip: i was having a bad trip becuase of it few months ago, i was investing in some feedback score optimizing services, because my results dropped and i thought that its because of the feedback score, but the true reason was that my ads was just running long and i need new creatives
[6.03.25, 14:00:15] ~ Filip: the one thing that i changed to improve it was my customer service
[6.03.25, 14:00:27] ~ Filip: and it worked out well for me, having A score customer service
[6.03.25, 14:00:37] ~ Filip: i dont care about feedback score rn tbh
[6.03.25, 14:12:30] ~ Cocow😈: You say in the checkout so I do not get it. You juste want to give discounts to clients that filled the form or you want a post purchase survey AFTER the buy ? 

Option 1: send an e-mail to client to Google form or Type form, , put the promo code in the thanking text, and when completed, they will see it and they can use it.

Option 2: You can probably find some tools to do post purchase survey on Shopify in the thank you page after checkout but in my opinion option 1 costs less and easy.
[6.03.25, 17:52:07] ~ Mo: im using katching bundle, but when a variant( or an offer) is added to cart , it just takes the main product image ( and not the variant image) . checked with their support, there is no way ( my theme is too much cutomsized …) is there any other alternative ? or maybe i’ll just have to code it.

[6.03.25, 18:40:56] ~ Alexander Soussani: that’s what i think as well, as someone who has used both kaching looks way better
[6.03.25, 19:27:30] ~ Mo: yeah its a bit confusing if the image doesnt reflect the right variant
[6.03.25, 19:32:32] ~ Ислам: Hey everyone,

I’ve been running Facebook ads for over a year now, and I’ve noticed something weird. Some days, the ads perform really well, bringing in great sales, and then other days—using the exact same creatives—the results just tank. It almost feels like Facebook is intentionally doing this, like one day it drives conversions, and the next, it just spends our budget to “test” its own platform.

I was thinking—what if we adjusted the budget dynamically? Lower it on bad days and increase it when performance is strong. Has anyone tried this? Would love to hear your thoughts!

Looking forward to your insights.

Thanks!
[6.03.25, 19:42:44] ~ Christopher Murphy: Try running manual bid instead of auto bid to avoid this

[6.03.25, 22:13:20] ~ Gedion: Any AI you guys can recommend that’s better then chatgpt? To facilitate copywriting etc..
[6.03.25, 22:15:13] Bilel: Try Claude. Many people say it’s better than ChatGPT. But I think it’s more about the prompt and the research than the models
[6.03.25, 22:18:12] ~ Gedion: Feel like chat doesn’t have the same level of understanding task as before, feels kinda dumb sometimes
[6.03.25, 22:30:13] ~ JULIUS: You guys should try the Perplexity combo with their R1 -> fantastic for research
[6.03.25, 22:39:17] ~ Joel Cederlund: I feel like Claude makes the copy so much better in my language. It choses more natural words that makes the copy sound much more native. Haven’t been able to get these result with ChatGPT
[6.03.25, 22:40:07] Carlos Leeseman: At the end Claude it’s better in writing copy, but it requires the *perfect* instructions. So it will takes a lot of time, because you need a lot of different prompts before your output is good. GPT is 10x more efficient in writing copy, what is more important at the end. With GPT we can write 10 VSLs a day, with Claude maybe 5 and it’s a lot of headache
[6.03.25, 22:47:29] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Guys quick question, If were to summarize the ideal job description of a creative strategist what would it be? is he also responsible for the copyright?

[6.03.25, 23:02:02] ~ Fabian: Same , I’m getting mad at ChatGPT all the time for its stupid answers 

Also it feels like a total yesman in ai, just tells me what I like to hear

Need to be super clear in my prompts to specifically not do that sometimes

And also, it often just repeat itself with the exact same answer when I complain about the answer

Like “I understand …” then proceed to say the exact same thing

Now its 7th March and its still not shipped, I ask every day for a update but doesnt really get anything, and now they start asking questions I already answered.

Just wondering if anyone here has positive experience with them? Paid for both products and shipping in early January, and while its not a large order, its still 7.500 eur. ‎<This message was edited>

[8.03.25, 16:37:40] ~ Mo: guys how do u stop getting those pushy emails from shopify freelancers  in your brand email/inbox , i think i consented to share my email somewhere but have no idea where
[8.03.25, 18:25:54] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: What is the best way to report a fake website using my copyrighted pictures and videos?

[8.03.25, 19:40:43] ~ Mohammed-amine: Nice to see you here!
[8.03.25, 21:32:19] Carlos Leeseman: Someone has a swipe file of UI/UX product pages designs?
[9.03.25, 0:20:54] ~ Alexander Soussani: hey guys hope your all doing well, i just wanted to know if split testing offers using kaching bundles is okay or is using apps more optimal
[9.03.25, 1:57:07] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Hey guys when you get a winning creative and put it into an advantage plus campaign for scaling - if you have similar product categories would you use one advantage plus campaign for your scaling or would you have a different advantage plus campaign scaling for each category?
[9.03.25, 2:26:19] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Let me know what you find
[9.03.25, 3:01:01] ~ Ислам: Hey guys, has anyone here selling digital products? Can you recommend to sell it ?
[9.03.25, 8:35:54] ~ Wouter Akika: yes brother
[9.03.25, 8:36:39] ~ Wouter Akika: dm me
[9.03.25, 8:53:22] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey guys
[9.03.25, 8:53:34] ~ Wouter Akika: anybody else who has not had a fb page feedback score in 6 months?
[9.03.25, 8:55:04] Marek Olszewski: Yep, it’s an ongoing thing, fb is updating the way they score pages
[9.03.25, 8:55:37] ~ Wouter Akika: Got it
[9.03.25, 19:55:25] ~ Neeraj: hey guys has anyone had experience with chargeback rate above 1% on stripe? i started a new stripe account a few weeks ago and a single customer accidentally placed a duplicate order, i refunded one immediately but the customer filed a dispute on both purchases (and the bank ruled in their favor on both). curious what penalties are and how important it is for me to get dispute rate under 1% (or 0.7%?) before the end of the month?
[9.03.25, 20:24:06] ~ Miika: Those of you doing multi 6-7 fig per month, so you collect and pay USA sales taxes (think its nexus). I’ve been paying them for 2 years now because I came over the 100k limit of sales in many states. So are you guys paying these as well?

Someone told me that I’m paying these and collecting these for no reason because I’m sending products from china. Seemed sketchy because I don’t believe in tax loop holes because of the problems of exiting the brand it later. Are you guys serious about these things?
[9.03.25, 20:30:17] ~ Bruno Oliveira: Hey Neeraj. Install a chargeback prevent app like Disputifier, chargeflow, chargeblast or any other.. This automatically triggers an alert when a person initiates a chargeback and processes a refund before it is recorded as a chargeback by the payment processor. It won’t cover 100% of them, but it will for the majority, depending on the card type. ‎<This message was edited>
[9.03.25, 20:55:27] ~ Diletta: Great advice! Is there something similar for Paypal? Or do you know if any of these apps are also good for Paypal?
[9.03.25, 20:56:53] ~ Mo: they manage both stripe and paypal as far as i know ( at least chargeflow one im using)
[9.03.25, 20:57:49] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah I spoke to a tax specialist once you have no operations in the US then you don’t need to pay ‎<This message was edited>
[9.03.25, 20:58:16] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I’ll send you exactly what they told me
[9.03.25, 21:00:55] ~ Alexander Soussani: hey guys what are your favorite apps to split test offers?
[9.03.25, 21:01:11] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I use a marketplace platform to order my goods from the supplier and pay only when a customer orders from me. The marketplace pays US tax on the supplier order and there is no need for us (the advertiser) to pay anymore than this. I’ll DM you an email I got from my tax specialists now
[9.03.25, 21:03:19] ~ Miika: Oh ok thank you!! I own the stock myself. It’s not dropshipping.
[9.03.25, 21:04:38] ~ Salman: Can you also DM me please, thankyou so much.!
[9.03.25, 21:06:38] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Course
[9.03.25, 21:09:26] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Once you don’t have any operations in the USA including agents working on your behalf you aren’t connected to ECI. (Customers ordering from USA doesn’t meant your connected to ECI) And if you put through your supplier order and that has US sales tax then you don’t need to pay anymore than that meaning you do not need to pay sales tax on the amount that the customer orders from you. Just keep your invoices and all that for the books ‎<This message was edited>

Job Title: Motion Graphics Animator for Medical & Product Visualization (X-Ray Style Effects)

Job Overview:

We are looking for a skilled motion graphics animator with experience in medical-style animations, product visualization, and augmented reality overlays. The project involves creating an X-ray-like effect that simulates blood circulation, nerve activity, or muscle stimulation over real footage of a wearable product.

If you have expertise in After Effects, Cinema 4D, Blender, or similar software and can create semi-transparent anatomical effects that enhance product demonstrations, we’d love to work with you!


---

Responsibilities:

Create realistic X-ray-style animations that overlay on real human body footage.

Design animated veins, nerves, blood flow, or muscle stimulation effects.

Integrate motion-tracking techniques to ensure the animation follows the body's natural movement.

Use glow, transparency, and augmented reality-like effects to create a visually engaging demonstration.

Work with provided product videos and apply the necessary VFX enhancements.

Ensure a smooth blend between the real footage and animated effects.



---

Requirements:

Proficiency in After Effects, Cinema 4D, Blender, or other relevant motion graphics tools.

Experience in medical animations, anatomical visualization, or product marketing effects.

Strong understanding of motion tracking and overlay techniques.

Ability to create realistic, glowing, and semi-transparent animations.

A portfolio showcasing similar animation styles (X-ray effects, nerve/blood flow simulations, or body enhancement visuals).

Knowledge of compositing and VFX techniques to seamlessly integrate animations into footage.



---

Preferred Skills (Not Required, But a Plus):

Experience with 3D rendering for anatomical structures.

Familiarity with AI-based animation tools for enhancing realism.

Ability to collaborate with medical illustrators or product designers for accuracy.



---

How to Apply:

If you have experience in creating X-ray-style product animations or medical motion graphics overlays, please send us:
✅ Your portfolio with similar animations
✅ A brief description of your workflow and tools
✅ Your pricing/rate and estimated delivery time

Looking forward to working with talented motion designers who can bring science and innovation to life through visuals!

[11.03.25, 6:44:11] ~ Austin: At the mastermind I get so much momentum being around people in the same business structure and mindset, would 2-3 of you guys be interested in meeting up and actually living together for about a month? Personally I wouldn’t want It to be anything flashy, but a time to really rub shoulders and grow exponentially. I live in North Carolina USA and living here’s not very expensive so we could find a place to stay for pretty low buy in. Please message if interested. ‎<This message was edited>
[11.03.25, 8:19:18] ~ P: i don't live out there - but respect for your level of commitment.

Need someone to manage my Facebook comments. Hide, like, reply etc essentially I need someone to monitor and act on negative comments within 10 minutes. I sell in all time zones so need 24 hours a day monitoring. I have a VA she’s great but obviously not available to do all of that.

Does anyone have a workaround for this? I could bring on more VAs too just need to figure out how to manage the process. 

Thanks in advance 🙌
[11.03.25, 13:46:21] ~ Mo: setting a goal for that period of time, pushing each other and crashing it ! always great being surrounded by killers. so… same here if anyone in Bali guys.

Bring any copy you want me to take a look at and come have a chat about your copy. 

I've also had a few questions about stages of awareness so I'll be covering what they are and what they mean today. 

See you soon! ✍️💪
[11.03.25, 15:47:08] ~ P: for classic payment gateways such as stripe and paypal, how do you handle them when you are scaling? Is there a way then to protect yourself from being blocked or banned? backup gateways to activate instead of the current ones or something like that?
[11.03.25, 15:54:50] ~ Kevin Krieg: Do yourself a favor and dont use stripe for ecom stuff. Heard too many bad stories and we got banned too right away after 20k rev and 0 chargebacks and 0 refunds
[11.03.25, 15:54:59] ~ Kevin Krieg: Paypal is pretty fine even when dropshipping, at least for us
[11.03.25, 15:55:02] ~ Kevin Krieg: And always always have a backup solution ready
[11.03.25, 15:56:10] ~ P: what alternative do you recommend for stripe? i have been using it for a year now and it has never given me any problems. But I would like to have a backup
[11.03.25, 15:56:30] ~ P: I have airwallex, but for US targets I have seen that the payment acceptance rate is lower
[11.03.25, 15:58:07] ~ Kevin Krieg: if you have stock and everything super white hat you might be good. For US alternatives, dunno. We use EU based ones so not an expert on that
[11.03.25, 15:58:53] ~ P: OK, I am also interested in the EU
[11.03.25, 15:59:16] ~ Kevin Krieg: We use mollie, very happy

[11.03.25, 22:02:32] ~ Cocow😈: Always testing with AA+ and BROAD for the creatives , and there is no better one in my case , but I tend to prioritize broad original audience
[11.03.25, 22:03:18] ~ Cocow😈: And think about excluding 180d 0r 90D purchase , in my case I tend to forget sometimes haha
[11.03.25, 22:05:05] ~ L: You prioritize broad or always test AA+? 😅
[11.03.25, 22:13:17] ~ Cocow😈: Testing always both. 

Then on scaling I use broad at the moment. If sometimes I decide just to test on audience for iterations or other things , I use broad.

[12.03.25, 16:46:06] ~ Daniel: We use Whatsapp since we’re selling in Europe, this is what we send to the customers (translated to English):

Hey {{first_name}}, This is CUSTOMER SERVICE NAME from BRAND NAME!

I saw that you were about to complete your order, but it didn’t go through. Is there anything we can help you with? 🤍

Or are you still unsure about something? Feel free to let us know—we're here to answer all your questions! 😊
[12.03.25, 16:46:08] ~ Daniel: After that every conversation is different, you can offer the customers a little extra discount or remove their objections to close the sale.
[12.03.25, 16:46:13] ~ Daniel: In our experience this gives the customer a lot of trust in the brand. We see great results doing this, and we get insights into why customers are not buying.
[12.03.25, 16:47:25] ~ Facundo: hey @⁨~Daniel⁩ what app do you use for this whatsapp automation?
[12.03.25, 16:47:58] ~ Daniel: CK: WhatsApp Chat & Abandoned
[12.03.25, 16:55:06] ~ Fabian: Why Whatsapp?
[12.03.25, 16:58:02] ~ Daniel: 99.9% of our customers use Whatsapp, and way more likely to engage in a conversation on Whatsapp than on SMS
[12.03.25, 16:58:16] ~ Daniel: But of course test what works best for your market

[12.03.25, 18:34:08] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. 

We use Synctrack PayPal tracking to sync the tracking numbers between Shopify and PayPal, but for some reason it does not recognize the upsells products, only the main product, so we end up needing to input manually the tracking number for the upsell orders.

Anyone know a way to fix it?
[12.03.25, 18:37:51] ~ Calvin: You can use Trackipal
[12.03.25, 18:38:16] ~ Calvin: It will recognize your upsells too
[12.03.25, 18:41:24] ~ Fabian: Can the Opt out text be in Swedish or is it strict "STOP TO OPT OUT"

We reported some competitors ads for copyright because he ripped all of our ads with the content from our creators.

[13.03.25, 12:33:22] ~ Ислам: Guys is interest targeting still works with Facebook when testing products??
[13.03.25, 12:52:51] Carlos Leeseman: Yes works great. Just test random interests.
[13.03.25, 12:53:31] ~ Ислам: What do you mean random? Not related to product?
[13.03.25, 12:54:17] Carlos Leeseman: Yeah, sometimes the weirdest interests works. You can’t always scale them long term, but ROAS is really great for me on some interests
[13.03.25, 12:56:16] ~ Ислам: Thats interesting, what is audience size you choose?
[13.03.25, 12:56:50] Carlos Leeseman: Depends per market. But never something smaller then 100k

[13.03.25, 17:55:12] ~ Miika: Think Shopify has its own thing called Shopify Tax and it can do it automatically for a small fee of 0.35%

[13.03.25, 22:27:40] ~ Mohammed-amine: I heard it’s just for underreporting issues
[13.03.25, 22:40:27] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Just disconnect it from the Meta App on Shopify to avoid under/overreporting
[13.03.25, 22:40:58] ~ Mohammed-amine: Disconnect what?

@⁨~Bony Ghadiya⁩ from More Than Scaling has secured  $870,000 in ad credit from Google this month. He's offered to distribute $1,500 or $3,000 in ad credits to members of BBA/ESS—this is the maximum allowable amount per account under Google’s current guidelines.
Please note that these credits can only be applied to new accounts linked to domains that have never been used for Google Ads before.
If you fit the above criteria, contact

Or at least have it on deck and ready to submit if they ask for it in future.

[16.03.25, 16:17:57] ~ Cocow😈: This depends on your tracking setup :) 

Before I had like you because had sever side and browser events. 

Now I only have server side with a CAPI solution 

Some CAPI still do server and web but be sure that you have only one tool that is giving the data to Facebook. 

Some people have CAPI from wetracked and shopify pixel app for example 

If you are sure that you have only one CAPI , contact their support and ask them help before hiring anyone
[16.03.25, 16:19:10] ~ Cocow😈: Deduplication is bad because too much purchases and analysis on meta ads cannot be done “correctly”

[16.03.25, 20:09:52] ~ Cocow😈: TW capi (SONAR) or just TW for attribution ? 

If just for attribution, I would suggest to cut the app of Shopify which is not the best for a server side solution as: 

- Wetracked
- Sonar (TW but i guess some people had troubles with it)
- There are others like omega and so on 

I personnaly use this since april 2024: https://apps.shopify.com/bily?locale=fr
[16.03.25, 20:10:44] ~ Cocow😈: Guys, what CAPI SOLUTION do you use so that he can choose the best option haha ?
[16.03.25, 20:16:18] ~ Facundo: guys any training/course you would recommend for a COO?
[16.03.25, 20:34:14] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thank you man this group is so good I’ve had so many people DM me and give me referrals where else would you get this!!
[16.03.25, 20:34:49] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I use Shopify app version I don’t think I use sonar what’s the difference?
[16.03.25, 20:36:03] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: There are a few out there investigating the issue since loads of accounts are experiencing / still safe to run ads as far as I’m aware
[16.03.25, 20:36:22] ~ Cocow😈: Sonar is a CAPI from triple whale , bur people tend not to understand difference between standard triple whale (attribution) and a CAPI solution
[16.03.25, 20:36:56] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: And does it work much better? More expensive? The problem is the Facebook side tho so not sure if this would fix it
[16.03.25, 20:37:44] ~ Cocow😈: Maybe the shopify app has been deprecated of I don’t know
[16.03.25, 20:38:08] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah could be

Check this
[16.03.25, 20:38:38] ~ Cocow😈: A CAPI is Necessary , and a good one
[16.03.25, 20:39:24] ~ Cocow😈: Improves getting true ROAS in meta and improve performance of add account as more data , and clean data is sent
[16.03.25, 20:39:28] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: How did I miss this?
[16.03.25, 20:39:38] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thank you! So Sonar will send the data back?
[16.03.25, 20:39:44] ~ Cocow😈: 🤣
[16.03.25, 20:39:56] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I asked one of the TW reps a while back and they said the data doesn’t get sent back
[16.03.25, 20:40:08] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: If that does it then I will 100% be going for it
[16.03.25, 20:40:11] ~ Cocow😈: Yes it will but someone wrote me and had issues with this , I guess a lot of people here are with wetracked
[16.03.25, 20:40:32] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: So it would make sense to have both?
[16.03.25, 20:40:41] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: CAPI and TW
[16.03.25, 20:40:43] ~ Cocow😈: Sonar is new arrived like q3 2024
[16.03.25, 20:40:53] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Okay I’m on this
[16.03.25, 20:41:11] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thank you so much for your help too bro
[16.03.25, 20:43:05] ~ Cocow😈: You have to put a CAPI, TW is nice for profit loss , seeing all the journey of your customer and omnicanal attribution to understand the efficiency of your marketing efforts and which channel has more impact. Check their website they have videos :) 

But no need for tw , that is a +
[16.03.25, 20:43:10] ~ Cocow😈: Welcome :)
[16.03.25, 20:45:45] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: So you’re saying if got a CAPI that all the data would get sent back to Facebook and so the reporting would be accurate? No need for TW analytics then?
[16.03.25, 20:46:49] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: But as you said it would be handy to have TW as you can see where the first touch point is
[16.03.25, 20:55:58] ~ Cocow😈: Reporting in meta ads ? Yes exactly that is one of the goal of a CAPI
[16.03.25, 20:56:34] ~ Cocow😈: Yes but the question is , will you really use it 🤣 I use for profit loss not so much for data personally
[16.03.25, 20:56:40] ~ Mo: from what i understood CAPI is more to help fb get you the right audience/customer, get data about your customer avatar traits & attributes and what they share in commun. Attribution is more binary, just to know which ad brought customer
[16.03.25, 20:57:24] ~ Cocow😈: They have like 5 attribution model 

Last click 
First click
All touchpoints and so on they have explanation on website :)
[16.03.25, 20:58:20] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I get you haha and yes I will 100% will still probably check it 27 times a day as usual 🤣
[16.03.25, 20:58:28] ~ Cocow😈: Exact , but CAPI helps as well your attribution in meta ads manager as more purchases and events go in the manager
[16.03.25, 20:59:15] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Thank you 🙏 getting a good understanding now and know what to do next. Results have been quite good as is so with this I assume they’ll only get better
[16.03.25, 21:00:03] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Pretty much:

CAPI - data sent back to platforms for better optimisation

TW - metrics
[16.03.25, 21:00:45] ~ Mo: makes total sense !
[16.03.25, 21:00:55] ~ Mo: cant sum it up better
[16.03.25, 21:01:19] ~ Mo: btw guys been some time didnt check event manager , just did, and found these

[16.03.25, 21:02:26] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yep same shit for me today
[16.03.25, 21:05:58] ~ Mo: do u have this for purchase ? i dont have it with atc/ic/purchase events. if so and results are good i wouldnt worry much
[16.03.25, 21:06:04] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I think most accounts are experiencing this today
[16.03.25, 21:06:10] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Probably a bug with Facebook
[16.03.25, 21:06:22] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Mine is a deduplication issue on all events
[16.03.25, 21:07:41] ~ Mo: Yeah so just keep an eye on it and see how it goes next couple pf days
[16.03.25, 21:07:53] ~ Wouter Akika: I got this form the company that is working on our new pixel setup, they are getting pretty known in the space now because they have a reputation of beating pixel accuracy and circumvneting the health flag issue ‎<This message was edited>
[16.03.25, 21:07:54] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I will bro I’ll
Keep you updated
[16.03.25, 21:07:55] ~ Wouter Akika: Dear Aimerce Client,

TLDR; This is an FYI / No action required. Do not worry. Nothing is breaking.

This is Yiqi. I'm reaching out about the error message many of you are seeing on your Events Manager or Ads Manager dashboards. This started happening today. The error states that "Events from the Server are not Deduplicated.”

Events Manager:

Ads Manager:

Screenshot 2025-03-16 at 09.01.31 (1).png


Who’s affected?
Brands that are using Shopify Native CAPI.
Brands that were using Shopify Native CAPI and recently switched to Aimerce within the last 30 days.
Who’s NOT affected?
Brands that are on Aimerce for more than 30 days.
What happened and should I be worried?
No. For now, from what I know, this is happening across the board on all brands that were/are sending events from both Conversions API and the browser Pixel in the last 30 days. I DO NOT believe you actually have duplicate events.

One of the easiest ways to verify is to do a quick event counting for Purchase events. Select the last 7 days (or yesterday), check the Purchase event number. Go to your Shopify dashboard, count the last 7 days (or yesterday) order number, to see if they match.

p.s. Sometimes there will be plus or minus 5 orders depending on the timezone but it should be very close.

Understanding how deduplication works
Facebook uses event_id parameter as an identifier that can uniquely distinguish between similar events. Facebook will only need to deduplicate if events are sent from both the Conversions API and the browser Pixel.

Aimerce handles events differently, in a better and cleaner way. Aimerce deduplicates both browser and server events and only sends from the server side. That's why you wouldn't see this error if you are on Aimerce alone in the past 30 days.

Why am I seeing it if I have been on Aimerce for more than 30 days?
If this is the case, you should look into whether you have anything else besides Aimerce connecting with your pixel:

Do you have a GTM tag on the site?
Do you have Facebook Data Sharing turned on?
Do you have another third-party app?
If you see one single green line from Server in Purchase event, you are all good: this is from Aimerce deduplicated events.

If you are seeing a blue line from Browser, you should look into my questions above.

[16.03.25, 21:34:53] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Last thing - about to take out a trial for we tracked for the CAPI side. What are people’s experience of them?
[16.03.25, 21:37:56] ~ Harvey: Wetracked is great @⁨~Brendan O’ Connell⁩

[16.03.25, 23:03:51] ~ Benjamin Walsh: Hey guys what is your naming convention for creative when you are testing a lot of static and video ?
[16.03.25, 23:18:48] ~ Cocow😈: HERE BOSS, this is my convention and you can for sure change, add, or remove but everything is automated and then it avoids having multiple naming and you can analyze your angles https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jA4oM2QhB3Adb0pLbVm0A0MwwmZGLYf0nd0CVpeFGyY/edit?usp=sharing ‎<This message was edited>

[17.03.25, 2:12:03] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Installed wetracked and it seems to have fixed the duplication errors. Events manager is looking clean with no errors showing.

Unless Facebook has since sorted it. Check your events manager and see

[17.03.25, 4:26:25] ~ Fabian: To those who have managed big brands:

How much of a difference have you noticed in dispute rates when implementing delivery updates, thank-you cards in packages, and high-quality packaging?

Since a long delivery time and poor packaging can put customers in a bad mood, it often leads to frustration and an increased number of disputes.
[17.03.25, 4:27:29] ~ Fabian: - does many of these things togheter make a diffrence? how big diffrence?
[17.03.25, 5:37:47] ~ Dayu Yang: @⁨~Fabian⁩ this is not as much of a shipping agent problem vs optimizing for packaging. Should consider how you can reduce the volume of the package itself to avoid triggering volumetric calculations
[17.03.25, 9:05:13] ~ Cocow😈: Great seems better , you only have server now :) Then you see has well your events quality going up (in your page below)
[17.03.25, 9:09:08] ~ Cocow😈: I would advise to put a post purchase flow with an email on +2D, +5D , + 7D for reassurance with 

Founder video or mission video 

Explanation of the process and sending again the contact , faq, track order pages 

Explaining that package is arriving and in case there is a delay , you apologise in advance and thanks them for their comprehension 


About packaging , do not know if this reduces disputes but this helps the brand image so in any case cannot be bad. Frustration could come if you have a complicated product and people do not get a using notice or a video
[17.03.25, 10:30:20] ~ Reece Mander: Anyone have a good OTO1 upsell template that's working?
[17.03.25, 12:12:04] ~ Reece Mander: Anyone have any numbers for % through a funnel. What should % be at each stage

[18.03.25, 12:12:27] ~ P: Hi everyone! When I create a winning VSL, how long can I use it and how can I make so many creatives just from that single VSL? I can change the hook so the first 5-10 seconds. But how many times can I do this? I would like to understand how to make the most of a winning VSL before having to make a new one
[18.03.25, 12:14:01] Topi: winning script and idea can run at least +1.5 and beyond, just based on my own data
[18.03.25, 12:14:11] Topi: It very much depends which segment of audience you target
[18.03.25, 12:14:22] Topi: Unaware / problem aware are the biggest segments
[18.03.25, 12:15:08] Topi: You can iterate until it just doesnt make sense anymore. There is no limit

[18.03.25, 15:47:43] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: How does the performance of a VSL compare to a normal ucg video ad when you first started it?
[18.03.25, 16:13:52] ~ Cocow😈: If you are on a niche whre u can run VSL, you have to test
[18.03.25, 16:14:03] ~ Cocow😈: this transformed my business (health)
[18.03.25, 16:14:18] ~ Cocow😈: the scalability is massive
[18.03.25, 16:18:52] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Thanks so much for the reply, when you say massive how much are you able to spend per day while maintaining healthy ROAS? Do you also sent the traffic from VSL to product page or advertorial?
[18.03.25, 16:31:00] ~ Cocow😈: Im on European market , so different from US

Yes at the moment directly to PDP but working on funnels

VSL drive the spent on the account, and you can scale it faster than others that will tend to crash at scaling

In my case impossible to stabilize a spend of more that 5K without VSLs in the loop 

A VSL can spend 10-20% of your daily budget without any problem if this is a banger
[18.03.25, 16:33:15] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Thats actually impressive! Well done👌Thanks so much very helpful i am planning to test VSL’s very soon.

[19.03.25, 19:17:58] ~ Mike Ramsey: RDR and CDRN are chargeback prevention alert tools that you can install that will allow you to refund a customer or resolve amicably, prior to it going to full blown chargeback status on your processing.

The alerts serve as a feature that triggers a notification to you and you can refund the customer without the CB hitting your processing account.  There are providers in here such as Chargeblast who can set you up with these tools.  Highly recommended to keep your processing account clean as you scale to avoid funding holds or entire account shutdowns with processors.

[19.03.25, 19:40:21] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): @⁨~Sonu Duhra⁩ issuers always favor consumers. You can be on camera making a charge and there's a chance of the consumer winning. On average merchants only win 10% of all disputes they fight.

[19.03.25, 19:42:03] ~ Mike Ramsey: This greatly depends on your fulfillment process and how you are disclosing and communicating your shipping timelines to clients. Klarna is a bit tricker because they favor on the side of the customer more for disputes vs. card brands.  Even if you fulfilled the product.

Example ) You say 5 day shipment on your site, but customer receives merchandise in 15 days.

[19.03.25, 19:43:17] ~ 🥇: does high Refund rate affect account ?
[19.03.25, 19:43:23] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Yes
[19.03.25, 19:43:31] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Want to keep it below 15%
[19.03.25, 19:43:38] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): 10 - 15%
[19.03.25, 19:44:16] ~ 🥇: So between 10-15% is not considered high risk
[19.03.25, 19:45:00] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): It’s definitely not good to be there, but there’s nuances like industry. For example, clothing has refund rate of 25% because of so many returns.
[19.03.25, 19:45:11] ~ Mike Ramsey: High refund rate typically means merchandise is bad OR you have high pressure upsells.  Higher the refund rate means you are likely engaging in opt ins without user realizing or high pressure funnel.  And this does impact your account reviews, holds, etc.  So keep an eye on it.
[19.03.25, 19:45:19] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): I would say keep it below 10% and it doesn’t get flagged. That’s what I’ve seen.
[19.03.25, 19:48:47] ~ 🥇: and you mean overall rate or just last 30days ?
[19.03.25, 19:51:03] ~ Sonu Duhra: so basically tracking number is worthless? So they need prove of delivery like a signature or photo? Should I not fight disputes with Klarna in the future or is it more of a delay issue?
[19.03.25, 19:51:31] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Most acquirers look at metrics based on last 3 months
[19.03.25, 19:54:34] ~ Mike Ramsey: Greatly depends on your products, region you are selling to, your demographic, length of time in business, etc.

Some regions of the world have higher return rates than others and if you are selling clothing, then that industry as a whole just has a higher rate of return.

For example, I have a client selling hearing aids to the US with a return rate of 20%, but that is considered average for that vertical vs. other verticals.  Plus he is dealing with older clientele who are a pickier on a medical related item.

If you were to ballpark it, 10% refund rate or below is tolerable, but if you are just warming up your account and you have a high refund rate that typically indicates a problem and you have to adjust accordingly.  So processors will be less tolerable with high refund rates out the gate.

CB rates should always be <1% to avoid processor issues.  Lower the better.

Hope that helps

[19.03.25, 20:08:19] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: It’s not worthless, but each payment processor or platform has its own Terms and Policies that all merchants shall consider in order to avoid unpleasant consequences such as “Klarna refunding orders even tho I shipped the item”. 2020-2025 is quite a tricky period in which platforms are under pressure and they usually side with consumers (example: Stripe refunding within 5 days under section 5.6 of the terms claiming unauthorized charges or Klarna refunding under their own Shipping Policy that beware, changes in accordance with your region at the moment of signing up). The recommendation is to always download the proper and applicable terms and abide by them. Example: https://x.klarnacdn.net/cdn-klarna-com/1.0/shared/content/policy/shipping/en_us/MerchantProtectionTerms.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com this is Klarna’s Protection Program. Always make sure to get and secure all the evidence in order to challenge their actions (unwanted) within the timeframe given by the same terms. Example: You won’t be able to overturn a dispute even tho shipping the item if you haven’t uploaded the tracking number within the timeframe given by Klarna. Then you’ll have lost the dispute and the item unless you go after the consumer yourself privately to reclaim the payment that the payment processor has reversed.

[19.03.25, 20:18:14] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: You’re welcome! Always make to sure to check the terms compliant with your region depending on your company’s registered address or your own address as a physical person (depends on who has signed up with the payment processor as it’s a binding agreement between you and them)
[19.03.25, 20:18:36] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: Yes, you should

[21.03.25, 11:33:48] ~ JULIUS: @⁨~Jeremy Leppink⁩ damn that sucks man.. I'm hearing more and more stories like that. If it can help somebody else, a good habit when buying new profiles is to always do these 3 things:

1) change F2A authentification
2) delete all existing and previous sessions
3) change password. 

That way you will reduce the risk of getting hacked by almost 100%
[21.03.25, 11:34:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Thanks man! I think i did all of those, 1 thing i didnt do is change back up email. This might be good to add to the list ;)
[21.03.25, 11:35:59] ~ JULIUS: Yeah I heard (not sure if that's true) that these companies that sell profiles, after sometimes they sell info to hackers. So if you don't change the backup email, existing sessions etc... you will be an easy target

[21.03.25, 19:39:23] Fabian: Hey guys, 

Anyone here based in Dubai (or similar) with a European company with the initiative to sell the brand?
[22.03.25, 1:29:54] ~ F: Hey everyone,

I just opened my U.S. LLC and need an address in the US to open bank accounts. 

The team that helped me with the setup suggested an option to rent a micro-apartment for $150/month (minimum 1-year commitment). They mentioned that this address would be sufficient for banking purposes, and they can also receive and forward mail if needed. 

Is this a good option, or would you recommend something else?
[22.03.25, 11:00:37] ~ Calvin: You definitely don't need to rent an apartment to get a bank account, you can go on anytimemailbox and get an address thats in a residential area - you can use a website called smarty to do this. You can also alternatively go on https://www.capitalone.com/apply/credit-cards/preapprove/?landingPage=ehp and see if it flags your address as a registered agent address when you eneter it. Do this before purchasing on open mailbox, if it doesn't then you're good to go
[22.03.25, 11:01:47] ~ Calvin: If you use anything else other than anytime mailbox make sure you dont use Bizee, they use the same adress for everyone and the adresses are flagged/ will get flagged very quickly
[22.03.25, 11:22:14] ~ F: Amazing thanks brother

[22.03.25, 21:15:54] Carlos Leeseman: If it’s <10 seconds, I would make it a GIF. Otherwise use third-party tool like Vidalytics
[22.03.25, 21:26:55] ~ Jacob: guys whats your recommended site for footage for video editors? story blocks? whats your best recommendation
[22.03.25, 21:29:08] Topi: Canva has huge stock footage library, but stock footage also kills your performance, dont recommend it
[22.03.25, 21:29:19] Topi: at least don’t use it on hooks or leads
[22.03.25, 21:32:34] ~ Jacob: you wouldn't recommend it to fill vsl's or videos? at all?
[22.03.25, 21:32:39] ~ Jacob: not for the hooks
[22.03.25, 21:33:34] Topi: Yeah maybe clip here and there does not harm but stitch most of your VSL from stock footage
[22.03.25, 22:26:07] ~ Fabian: I use mostly clips from Tiktok and youtube, but whats your opinion on like pain animations
[22.03.25, 22:34:30] Topi: *dont stitch
[22.03.25, 22:37:13] Topi: I recommend going trough the effort of getting b-roll recorded with actors. Its not hard nor expensive. You cannot just swipe content forever anayways so why not level up right now
[22.03.25, 22:39:54] ~ Fabian: What’s you opinion on pain animations in vsls, why I ask: because you said Stock footage will drop the performance and for example back pain animations looks very stock footage
[22.03.25, 22:40:46] ~ Jacob: Do you have like a system or some template to which shots u wanna get fron the actors? Becquse its need to be very organized to fill a vsl?
[22.03.25, 22:41:13] ~ Jacob: Especially if its longer one
[22.03.25, 22:41:37] Topi: I think pain animations are fine, if you mean medical animations
[22.03.25, 22:41:50] ~ Fabian: Yes thank you
[22.03.25, 22:43:31] Topi: Just our va sends

- general instructions how to record
- ⁠shotlist what to record

Other than that

- pre-fixed price with actors
- ⁠aim to use same proven actors for easy deliver and better price

[23.03.25, 1:16:35] ~ Salman: *Received this in an email for smart marketer*
The problem with CLV is that it’s slow-moving, hard to measure, and not actionable in real time.

CVV, on the other hand, tells you how fast a customer generates revenue. 

So with CVV, you can:
Optimize your ad spend in real time instead of guessing long-term value.
Identify which products bring in the most repeat customers — and double down.
Find this data instantly in your Shopify dashboard (no complicated math needed).
Here’s how to apply this today:
Check your Shopify cohort analysis — sort by first product purchased and compare CVV across different offers.
Spot your fastest revenue drivers — which products turn new buyers into repeat customers the quickest?
Shift your ad spend toward those winners and let real-time data drive your strategy.
[23.03.25, 1:16:52] ~ Salman: but I’m unable to sort by first product, don’t see an option
[23.03.25, 1:16:54] ~ Salman: how to do this?
[23.03.25, 1:22:32] ~ Cocow😈: Definitely buy a 20$ app called Shrinkvid in Mac. The output is in the long compression tool amazing and it compresses sometimes more than 90%
[23.03.25, 1:25:12] ~ Cocow😈: What is for you a fair price for let’s say 20 b roll of an actor ? And do you use backstage ? 

Thanks
[23.03.25, 1:26:39] ~ Salman: Found how to do it! In case anyone else is wondering and as confused as I was, let me know 🙂
[23.03.25, 6:37:24] Topi: Between 100-150 usd

Hey guys, getting into collagen gummies. Any recommendations for size & flavor?
[23.03.25, 10:03:20] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi all 

I installed wetracked and performance has dipped.

Are there a few variables to test before making the decision to see if it is the tracking that’s working or not?

I have auto advanced matching turned on in the events manager as well.

EMQ is high on purchases and around 6 on the rest which I heard is normal. The native Shopify api was much better. 

Existing creatives that usually perform at high budget have performed terribly and yesterday had my worst day in a year with profit margins.

They are fine at smaller budgets but when I try scale the behaviour seems strange.

I have mentioned this to wetracked and in fairness they want to extend my trial the customer support is excellent but just not sure of them atm ‎<This message was edited>
[23.03.25, 10:49:46] ~ Cocow😈: Thanks 🙏
[23.03.25, 11:45:22] ~ Bony Ghadiya: You can start with that and get your bank accounts and everything approved. Once done, move to https://www.anytimemailbox.com/ and change your address everywhere on bank, on LLC etc
[23.03.25, 11:56:42] ~ F: Thank brother appreciate that🤝

[23.03.25, 22:28:31] ~ Cocow😈: will be quicker to do it on funnelish

[24.03.25, 19:54:05] Carlos Leeseman: Not really possible. If you have a lot of code, you can try to optimize that. But compressing images and GIFs will make the most difference
[24.03.25, 20:16:54] ~ Powa: Thanks, I’ve already optimized images and GIFs, so that part should be fine. I’m starting to think load speed might not be the issue after all. The percentage of people who actually land on the page after clicking the ad was steady at around 89% for the past few months, but it dropped to 69% this month and I haven’t made any changes to the advertorial page. Not sure what’s causing it. Any idea what could be going on?
[24.03.25, 20:18:27] Carlos Leeseman: Check whit Clarity the issue and why people bounce

[25.03.25, 16:01:11] ~ David B: Just dealing with a technical issue. Give me 2 minutes.
[25.03.25, 16:02:55] ~ David B: Okay I'm in let's go!
[25.03.25, 16:55:09] ~ RS: Are stripe instant payouts working now for you who have EU accounts? It started to glitch a few hours ago, shows available funds to withdraw instantly but the button does not work. For all my stripe accs. I withdrawed instant payouts today already and received standard payouts so it was good ‎<This message was edited>
[25.03.25, 16:56:21] ~ Peter Tzemis: Anyone here have a stripe rep? We’re running heavy volume and I want a rep before I switch more of my processing over
[25.03.25, 17:04:35] ~ Mike Ramsey: What region are you headquartered?  I have reps I can hook you up with but it’s regionalized for AM assignment.  Feel free to DM
[25.03.25, 17:07:01] ~ Peter Tzemis: Usa
[25.03.25, 17:17:42] ~ K: Anybody knows a sick instruction kind of video to shoot product pictures
[25.03.25, 18:21:03] ~ John B: Hey Guys, long story short someone is using all of my brand’s images and custom content, that it includes ugc, art designs we pay for, and every single picture/ video on our site is the same as theirs. Same brand colors, same layout, they also stole our ads I made myself and just slapped a different text on top of the previous one. I’m all for competition running the same product, but these guys quite literally just stole my entire brand. I got me and my team to report their ads on Meta but they’re still up a few days later. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should do next? I don’t have a patent or trademark. However, im pretty sure by law all the content on my website I paid to have made is enough for them to get taken down. I figured I should reach out to meta next and ask them to take a look into the account? Anything helps guys thank you a lot.
[25.03.25, 18:21:59] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Have you also reached out to Shopify if that’s the platform you are on? They can shut down the product page I’ve seen this happen
[25.03.25, 18:26:43] ~ John B: Something like this happened before and I saw on a forum you need to file an intellectual property violation or something like that, but it was asking me for some documents proving it was mine I did not have. I will however reach out to an agent on shopify and ask them which for some reason I didn’t even think to do lol. Thank you
[25.03.25, 18:27:54] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: I think you can provide them the information from you and the supplier of content and that will be enough. No problem man. Hope you get it sorted soon
[25.03.25, 18:29:19] ~ John B: okay sweet, thank you
[25.03.25, 21:08:43] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi guys just giving my experience since moving back to the Shopify/Facebook api versus wetracked. Results have turned around within 24 hours and ready for scale - all EMQ scores have gone up.

I’d be wary of wetracked they tried pushing a video on me that shows low EMQ scores doesn’t matter which didn’t convince me too much.

Obviously it works very well for some accounts and not for others.

Food for thought for those who are currently evaluating tracking setup. ‎<This message was edited>
[25.03.25, 23:12:56] ~ Santi Roa: Hi bro! This happens to me every week
[25.03.25, 23:12:59] ~ Santi Roa: I will send you an SOP
[25.03.25, 23:13:03] ~ Santi Roa: Give me a few hours
[25.03.25, 23:36:13] ~ Henry: Hey guys, does anyone have a connection for Amazon listing optimization? Our product is about to be shipped to Amazon warehouse and ready for launch soon so hoping to get this done ASAP
[25.03.25, 23:58:18] ~ Santi Roa: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQjltNfl7x4VKsy9ZUksWhPGjZEeBRymgljuQZ0gD34/edit?usp=drivesdk
[25.03.25, 23:58:44] ~ Santi Roa: Here's an SOP I made a few years ago. Not sure if everything stills relevent but it's a great starting point
[26.03.25, 0:20:03] ~ Cocow😈: Have you started with DMCA ? 

Other pro tip: try to contact their registrar. If you contact them or contact their juridical department , they may totally block the domain
[26.03.25, 0:22:50] ~ Cocow😈: Heard about Aimerce @⁨~Jeremy Leppink⁩ can tell you a story about it. One of his student installed and this changes his business. He was on meta health issues so moved to aimerce with custom purchase event. Not telling you to use custome event , but have a look at what they offer with tracking 


I am using an app called Bily since 2024 , and this is not really bad. However does not connect to funnelish
[26.03.25, 0:42:00] ~ John B: awesome, thank you so much
[26.03.25, 0:43:00] ~ John B: I just filed one with shopify today. I’ll look into the registrar option as well. thanks man.
[26.03.25, 0:44:12] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah I spoke with Yiqi from aimerce I’m definitely going to go ahead in the next 2,3 months she knows her shit and built a lot of the platform she was a meta engineer.
[26.03.25, 1:08:23] ~ Henry: lol yeah that student was me. Can confirm
[26.03.25, 1:17:48] ~ Reece Mander: Does it work with funnelish?
[26.03.25, 1:23:24] ~ JULIUS: Jeez 🤯 https://x.com/jacob_posel/status/1904653829401903126?s=46&t=56GPUkhb6GFLhrL1dhLDmQ
[26.03.25, 1:33:55] ~ L: Crazy good man, thank you for sharing
[26.03.25, 2:04:09] ~ Guy Edan: Does someone have a contact/company that does business insurance?
[26.03.25, 5:27:16] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2024/08/29/introducing-the-visa-1724958906425.html

@⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩ do you have any info on this, how will this look like?

[26.03.25, 5:56:40] ~ Mike Ramsey: Pushed back till October 1 - was at a conference with Visa a couple weeks ago and our council pushed back on some of the initial rollout requirements.   Good news is that the head at Visa rolling this out is my mentor and we connect monthly so I can spill live updates.

As a pre-cursor, ensure you have tight front-end fraud monitoring and dispute management process.  Based on new rules, you can’t soley rely on chargeback alerts to keep you off Visa’s radar.

For rollout, you need to keep overall dispute rate (fraud and non-fraud) below 1.5% and then January 2026 it's at .9%. ‎<This message was edited>
[26.03.25, 7:56:01] ~ John B: Hey guys, started a new store nearly two weeks ago now. We’ve done about 160 in orders since. I’m fairly new to ecom and am not experienced when it comes to ordering inventory, but does anyone have any recommendations of when I should start to consider ordering in bulk? Our margins aren’t amazing all time on the store however past 4 days I think we’ve started to hit the right audience and have 20% margins on avg. Any advise helps, thank you!
[26.03.25, 7:57:52] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Well done John just two weeks and you got 160 orders ! And 20% is not bad at all
[26.03.25, 7:59:43] ~ John B: Thank you!
[26.03.25, 9:01:44] ~ Cocow😈: Ask the MOQ, to be able to do little customization. Just adding logo is already something 

I would take this MOQ or more if you can afford. If you see long term and that the product seems to be evergreen, good, and satisfied customers then I would start to bulk as soon as finances are able to
[26.03.25, 9:02:21] ~ Cocow😈: So then you can leverage your Brand product on ads and this can be good to outperform the copycats hahaa ‎<This message was edited>

[26.03.25, 16:16:25] ~ Mikael: Seems like Airwallex is shutting down Funnelish stores. Any good solution as payment method to funnelish? (Stripe is not being easy on us).
[26.03.25, 16:25:07] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: How are they shutting them down?
[26.03.25, 16:25:29] ~ Mikael: Airwallex is closing the payment method on their side. locking the money
[26.03.25, 16:40:23] ~ Allan L: Hey ecommers. 
A friend of mine lost access to his shopify store. He lost access to his Authenticator but has the login. 
He used all recovery codes. 

The support isnt helping, anyone who has a insider or a solution for him to get back in to his store?
[26.03.25, 16:41:35] ~ L: Do you know if there’s any specific reason on why they’re shutting it down ? 
Did they shut you down or it’s something you’ve heard?
[26.03.25, 17:09:01] ~ Jacob: its still working for me with funnelish and no one locked my money
[26.03.25, 17:09:12] ~ Jacob: just the approval rate went down thats the main problem
[26.03.25, 17:09:24] ~ Jacob: like last week 40% of the deals through funnelish didn't pass
[26.03.25, 17:10:57] ~ Fabian: What? Why is that? What store have been shut down, mine is ok
[26.03.25, 17:12:04] ~ Fabian: Also did you submit your Shopify store or funnel?

I have submitted my main domain (the Shopify store), then I run funnels on the www. Subdomain
‎[26.03.25, 17:15:01] ~ Jacob: ‎image omitted
[26.03.25, 17:15:17] ~ Jacob: you can see in the analytics in funnelish under payment methods
[26.03.25, 17:43:21] ~ Matthew Martorano: What tax services are you guys using for international sales and vat calculations?
[26.03.25, 17:44:34] ~ Matthew Martorano: Checkout Champ has Airwallex and 270 other gateways from around the world as an FYI.
[26.03.25, 17:45:14] ~ Mikael: Ive not got any store shut down. But close friends are. I dont know the reason why.
[26.03.25, 17:47:42] ~ Fabian: Have you received a lot of chargebacks?

Airwallex isn’t the best for card payments anyways
[26.03.25, 17:48:28] ~ Jacob: nope
[26.03.25, 17:48:50] ~ Fabian: I’ve heard airwallex is one of the worst alternatives for card payments
[26.03.25, 17:49:03] ~ Fabian: When it comes to approval rate
[26.03.25, 17:56:40] ~ Jacob: it wasn't like that few weeks ago i was on 75%
[26.03.25, 17:56:45] ~ Jacob: but i feel the last 2 weeks is worse
[26.03.25, 18:08:16] ~ John B: thanks brotha

[26.03.25, 23:10:57] ~ Jacob: this is the promt he used - Create a high-quality lifestyle photo featuring my product in [specific setting or location], held or used by [detailed person description — age, gender, style, etc.], styled in a [specific vibe or aesthetic], with visual emphasis on [key product feature, e.g. packaging, texture, use-case]. Make sure the product is clearly visible and naturally integrated into the scene.
[26.03.25, 23:12:04] ~ John B: yeah man I’m actually using this right now and the results are wild. My product is not as simple as a facial cleansing bottle, but it’s still getting the majority of the small details right. Also the avatar looks very realistic. This is a game changer no doubt.
[26.03.25, 23:13:22] ~ Jacob: yeah and with runaway or kling you can also make them move
[26.03.25, 23:13:30] ~ Jacob: so its create b rolls for video
[26.03.25, 23:20:02] ~ Slav: Does anybody sell clothes? 

Want to try this niche and was wondering if anybody can tell a bit more about this type of product.

Plan on selling it in US
[26.03.25, 23:34:34] ~ Kevin Krieg: Guys put your creative team on the new 4o image generation. Results are insane. Gathered some fire tweets here where yo ucan see prompts:

[27.03.25, 10:04:08] Carlos Leeseman: Okay thank you
[27.03.25, 11:31:05] ~ Fabian: Anyone else experience it so hard to pay Meta for ads? 

When i have a outstanding balance that needs to be paid, I Always have to try a bunch of diffrenct cards. Saying "payment done" and doesent charge the card. 

Avarage time to pay Meta = 1 hour

[27.03.25, 20:30:02] ~ Diletta: Speaking of Funnelish, does anyone know how to avoid double orders from people going back and forth, post checkout, from upsell to checkout and then back to upsell? 🙈
[27.03.25, 20:31:24] Carlos Leeseman: Put headline on top of page
[27.03.25, 20:34:24] ~ Diletta: Already done 🥲🫠 but people don't read.. or sometimes they don't remember how many pieces they bought literally 20 seconds before

[28.03.25, 15:27:06] ~ Alexander Soussani: what is the best wallet to use for credit card on funnelish by the way, i see a lot of you guys talking about airwallex is it better than stripe?
[28.03.25, 15:28:01] ~ Fabian: Stripe is a lot better for cc
[28.03.25, 15:28:12] ~ Fabian: For approvals
[28.03.25, 15:28:22] ~ Jacob: im not sure, i had to verify my account, like 1 week ago, but i didn't have my passport, and i even message their support to tell them, i renovate my passport, so , but suddenly it got blocked for withdraws, i dont know if there is a connection, because someone else here show they did is to him, i dont know to be honest

[28.03.25, 15:28:40] ~ Fabian: Did you withdraw a lot?
[28.03.25, 15:28:50] ~ Jacob: of course i use it as my bank
[28.03.25, 15:28:58] ~ Jacob: i use the credit card
[28.03.25, 15:29:27] ~ Fabian: But for what?

I mean did you do real bank withdraws or did you just pay with your card?
[28.03.25, 15:29:35] ~ Jacob: stripe approval rate is high by 20%-30% from funnelish
[28.03.25, 15:29:49] ~ Jacob: ah, just pay with card, but pay with card is withdrawl
[28.03.25, 15:29:56] ~ Fabian: Ok ok

[28.03.25, 15:30:01] ~ Fabian: Very wierd
[28.03.25, 15:30:19] ~ Jacob: yeah made me very angry yesterday lol
[28.03.25, 15:30:52] ~ Fabian: What will you do about it? I mean even if you fix another bank

You can’t use airwallex no more? Or can you change the payout account?
[28.03.25, 15:31:48] ~ Jacob: i apply to another hong kong bank...i will open stripe hong kong...but at the moment, i cannot do much because i have a big reserve there, so anyway i need to wait the money to release
[28.03.25, 15:32:15] ~ Jacob: ill try move to stripe because the approval rate is very bad now in airwallex
[28.03.25, 15:32:24] ~ Jacob: for c
[28.03.25, 15:32:50] ~ Fabian: I hope this doesn’t happen to me, can you send to me in private, or here if you want to

How much money it was in circulation on that account

I want to know because I want to prepare for it
[28.03.25, 15:33:36] ~ Fabian: Because I think they are you as a bigger risk depending on how much you spend , and how much the revenue is
[28.03.25, 15:34:14] ~ Jacob: i think something going in there...no one of my account managers answered me for almost 1 week

I’ve been working with an agency called Disruptive Media for the past few months. They specialize in native advertising and provide a €40,000 monthly credit line, which can be a huge advantage for scaling campaigns without upfront capital.

They help with everything from ad account setup and campaign management to optimising creatives and targeting strategies. Their team has experience running high-spend campaigns across major native ad platforms, making it easier to achieve profitable results.

If you’re looking to scale with native ads and want more details about how they can help, feel free to reach out!

What can I do? Agency ad avvounts? 

And if so, does anybody know of a good one where I can top up with my Amex
[31.03.25, 22:50:50] ~ Malak: I think it's better to use agency ad-acc bro in this scenario, I have one company who does it for me I pay 2.5% top-up fee through WIRE.

[1.04.25, 21:37:41] Matán Intsuper: Yes it’s glitchy always
[2.04.25, 0:01:43] ~ Wouter Akika: AI
[2.04.25, 0:29:08] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Hi all

What’s your bench mark atc to visitors ratio on an ad?

Trying to benchmark CBOs and ASCs at moment 

Not using advertorials yet
[2.04.25, 3:54:13] ~ Cocow😈: Atc in my perspective depends on market , product price , and many others 

If you benchmark wouldn’t be more suitable to benchmark directly in your ads manager by testing ?
[2.04.25, 3:55:06] ~ Cocow😈: Because if I launche tomorrow your product, your market , with my ad account and pixel , this would be totally different

[2.04.25, 11:46:31] ~ Mo: guys any tips for creators on how to make the content sound natural not like an Ad. most creators sounds like bots reading scripts. I recently dont give a script anymore, just some key elements, and ask them to be themselves… any tips would be much appreciated. ‎<This message was edited>
[2.04.25, 12:04:57] ~ K: give more visual/audio examples on how you would like them to speak and really emphasize that in the briefing. What you also could do is try to schedule a short call with them before they film to go over tonality so they get it right before they even start or they send voice messages of certain script parts. And if they dont perform good there just dont hire them i guess
[2.04.25, 12:10:43] ~ Mo: yeah i tried to give instructions but they just make it worse. as u said just dont hire them. i feel that this is given, some creators are just good at this , some sucks. lately i look for creators on tiktok, who are already confortable talking to camera and used to go live.. ‎<This message was edited>

[2.04.25, 19:03:24] ~ Num: Hey everyone I'm running an advertorial that redirects to my Shopify product page, but Facebook is counting the redirect as a purchase event even though no purchase actually happened. Has anyone else run into this issue before or found a fix?
[2.04.25, 19:03:57] Matán Intsuper: funnelish?
[2.04.25, 19:04:06] Matán Intsuper: use the pixel helper by facebook and try to find where is the purchase event
[2.04.25, 19:04:18] ~ Num: yes from funnelish to shopify
[2.04.25, 19:05:02] Matán Intsuper: check funnelish pixel settings maybe it fires purchase on your advertorial
[2.04.25, 19:05:09] Matán Intsuper: just leave view content or something

[2.04.25, 23:40:09] ~ Guy Edan: So what’s the best way to do subscriptions on funnelish? I was thinking of using a funnel on funnelish that sends them to a subscription checkout on Shopify (assuming that’s possible). Anyone have other ideas? ‎<This message was edited>
[2.04.25, 23:42:56] ~ Ryan Leven: Highly recommend using checkout champ for subscription stores /
Offers. 

I’ve tested all of the CRMs and funnel builders, checkout champ is the one to use, all of my brands do between 1-3m monthly on checkout champ.
[2.04.25, 23:43:11] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Anyone watching the tariffs?
[2.04.25, 23:43:58] ~ Doug Crowe: What features make it the best for you? I’m running on Funnelish but have a backup CC account. Haven’t justified the switch yet.
[2.04.25, 23:45:38] ~ Ryan Leven: Unlimited customizations on your offer, funnel, subscription setup, recovery, top of the line cb protection, support is insanely good, once I have my brands setup on checkout champ and they’re running…. They pretty much run themselves and I only ever need to touch ads.
[2.04.25, 23:46:27] ~ Ryan Leven: There are literally zero restrictions on how you want to run your business, mids setup, funnels etc. 

Ease of use is just great + automations
[2.04.25, 23:47:08] ~ Doug Crowe: Thanks!
[2.04.25, 23:47:26] ~ Ryan Leven: No problem
[2.04.25, 23:54:01] ~ Jeroen: Het guys quick question, klarna by shopify payments is just turned off today on our shopify, we tought maybe we can start with strip klarna but that one also does'nt work it says: Klarna has not approved your business to offer their payment method. any one has some contacts at klarna or faced the same issue and can help me with a solution?
[2.04.25, 23:55:53] ~ Mike Ramsey: Also way more payment processing options with checkoutchamp (100+) and cascading ability to optimize authorization rates / conversions.  Plus dynamic currency display.  

Lots of flexibility with CC from a payment processing perspective which helps open up additional markets.
[3.04.25, 0:01:07] ~ Kevin Krieg: Hey guys, I will unfortunately have to cancel tomorrows Content Sourcing call. I have a flight right at that time. Any questions or follow ups from last week, kindly shoot me a message. Talk again soon ✌️
[3.04.25, 0:48:31] ~ Jacob: They are intgrated with funnelish?
[3.04.25, 1:04:44] Matán Intsuper: It’s better to avoid Funnelish for subscriptions
[3.04.25, 1:08:21] ~ Diletta: Thanks for your advice! 🙏🏻 Does Checkout Champ allow people to manage their subscription independently? And, unlike Funnelish, does it manage to integrate the automatic renewal of subscriptions correctly with Shopify?
I'm having problems with Funnelish and subscriptions too....
[3.04.25, 1:20:29] ~ Mike Barnwell: Hey wanted to get some feedback on just running ads. We obviously learned setting up with interest targeting but we had been doing advantage plus with a company that has been helping out we had some really good months then everything lately has completely dropped off. Just trying to see the way most people in ESS are setting up their ads in their facebook accounts. Looking for some direction so we can get things turned around?
[3.04.25, 3:11:48] Matán Intsuper: Most people set it as it’s shown in the course where Serhii teaches the method
[3.04.25, 3:12:00] Matán Intsuper: I suggest you to watch it it’s pretty good and still works well
[3.04.25, 3:41:35] ~ Jacob: Hi, first of all, there is no "one" method, every expriencied media buyer eventually mix some methods with time because there is a lot of testing in it.

But anyhoo, something basic could be:

1.) First of all decide your budget because it's important and will determine what you will do.
2.) Let's take $500 for a day for this example.
3.) You can create 10 adsets, with 3 ads inside of them. 50$ each. or 5 of 100$, seriously there is no right or wrong. but don't put to little like 10$/20$ it will take to much time.
4.) Now for the strategy of the ads...
5.) You can really play with it - in the ESS course there is a good model by one of the agencies that make a table for video editors and it's shows the levels of the market by eughene schwartz.
6.) So what this model shows is basically the awareness levels—from completely unaware, to problem aware, solution aware, and product aware. And each of those stages needs a totally different ad vibe.
For example:
If you're targeting cold traffic (unaware), don't go pitching the product right away. Instead, focus on the pain point or tell a relatable story that hooks them emotionally.
If they're warm (solution aware), then it's all about why your product is the best choice, maybe with a cool demonstration or powerful social proof.
And if they already know your product? Then offer, urgency, scarcity. Straight up.
7.) The beauty of having multiple ad sets is that you can test all these angles at the same time. Maybe one ad set is cold traffic with emotional storytelling, another one is more logical and benefit-focused, and another one is just straight up "here’s why this offer is insane—go grab it now."
8.) anyhoo - it's not a most, but it one framework. if you put my message in gpt and ask for more, youll get more frameworks for this 10 adsets.
9.) track performance - the fact you put 50$ does not mean you need to let it all spend, track the numbers, checkout cost, clicks, conversion rate, but if you just warming, i will sometimes even keep losing ad for few days just to warm the pixel
10.) after you have some winners - you can put them inside cbo - with 3/5 duplicated adsets (again this is one CBO method of duplication, there are others... - for example you can put the winners, and make 5 adsets inside the cbo with five different lookalikes and see what performing the best - each adset - different lookalike)
12.) cbo start with 50$/100$ minimum - and if its profitable you can up the budget by 25% each day and duplicate it by 2/3 times each day and see how it performs

again this is just one strategy and you can change things inside ‎<This message was edited>

[5.04.25, 1:33:54] ~ Ryan Leven: Use a great 3PL who has negotiated rates down with USPS by leveraging their 500k orders per month volume

[6.04.25, 11:13:38] ~ Cocow😈: Maybe try to put upsells directly related to the product that do not need the client to think about what is the utility of the product your are proposing 

I runned ab test , nothing really changed in my case but this was related products. So I just decided to leave it as I guess this can be a bit more impactul in the long term

[9.04.25, 7:17:42] ~ Bestfulfill—william: tariffs( I dont want to talk with politics, so all these ideas below is just neutral )

1: bulk shipping orders has been affected already from today 9th of April, with an average rate of  104%  of the product cost(shipping cost will not have extra tariffs charges)

2: small parcel orders if u ship from China,(similar to countries outside USA.) will have tariffs  starting from May 2rd.


Cost higher 

For small parcels, will have a roughly add-up of $0.5-$2 per parcel. This doesn’t matter if u ship from china or use, since tariffs are based on product cost level, 




Bestfulfill idea, 

We all know trump is a smart business man and on going if he needs to win president again in the new election, he has to prove himself qualified  or at least have some important moves either bring in more jobs or factory to USA or solve the economy issues. Most of you guys already live in USA so pretty much know the basic living costs are raising up like double, for examples eggs are limited by person when u buy in Costco, so things are happening already with or without tariffs.


Trump is smart  he knows exactly what he is doing

tariffs advantages

USA stock evaporated 5 trillion is what he wants, if he wants to achieve his dream he must go in three ways 

1: tariffs policy will force the stock market to go down, the US will have 10 Trillin dollars of debt due this year, which they definitely can’t pay off with their finances, But cost of refinancing to pay off the previous debts  is way too high, 1:inflation has been high 2: the federal reserve also said no plan to cut interest rates in short term, all this gives him no option but tariff WAR. Squeeze all the money from stock market to buy bonds, which equals to low-cost financing. Then Elon handles the efficiency department to cut the budget, with all these, the debts problem will be solved. 

2: tariffs will force the manufacturing back to US, increase job opportunities and income. After a pain period of price increases, prices will have chance to go down.  the other important thing is  reduce inflation will lower the interest rate of debt, take 10-year treasury bonds as example, according to the current algorithm, every 1% reduction can reduce 1 billion dollars interests

3: strong tariffs like this is to force weak countries to sit down and negotiate with USA like Japan has already stated its position,


Tariffs weakness point, 

1: inside USA, the opposition to him can not be too loud. But current situation,  Its pretty chaos with parade demonstration going on there
2: outside USA, the other opponents don’t turn the table. China has started to overturn the table, although trump has announced the new add-up tariffs of more than 100% rate,  China still did have any plans of notifications to compromise. USA dares to bully with financial and trade method because of its former foundation of national strength  and the strong position of the dollar. From WW2 to five years ago, basically USA is the one who had the final say. But now things have changed, we all say this is a major change unseen in a century. The bipolar structure of the 2 big economies china and US has emerged,


Above all, unless we are rule makers, a business man or brand owner, nothing else we can do but to get ourselves  used to the new changes, ‎<This message was edited>
[9.04.25, 7:28:17] ~ Mo: guys do u have a template for job contract when hiring new employees … with everything that should be included in the contract ?
[9.04.25, 7:57:55] ~ John B: super insightful, thanks man.
[9.04.25, 8:54:51] ~ Farhat Godil: @⁨~Bestfulfill—william⁩ any idea how will the tariff be collected? I have few bulk orders in transit already scheduled to be delivered on Thursday.

Earlier I used to receive invoices from UPS (they used to pay customs on my behalf) few weeks after delivery.

Is it the same this time?
[9.04.25, 9:01:54] ~ Bestfulfill—william: I am not sure your terms with supplier so can’t suggest.
[9.04.25, 9:03:00] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Normally express it’s either paid by sender or receiver directly. They are not supposed to pay for it
[9.04.25, 9:18:08] Marek Olszewski: Anyone deployed a subscription app alongside their product? I have questions about payment processing (stripe vs google play/apple store), my devs are advising against stripe

[9.04.25, 20:00:58] Greg Sourcing China Trybello: Hey Guys. Apologies for the long message and being a bit MIA in the group. The tariff stuff has been keeping us busy. Here are 10 things we’ve been thinking about and sharing with our clients and we wanted to share it here too in case it’s helpful.

1. No One Knows the "Final" Tariff Details Yet
There’s still no clarity on how high the new tariffs will be — they could be 104%, 129% (still unknown if section 301 is still in place as an FYI), or something else entirely — or how broadly they’ll be applied (just China, or China plus other parts of Asia?). We also don’t know which product categories will be affected or how implementation will roll out. We anticipate uncertainty to continue for the near-future.

2. While Tariff Numbers Are Unclear, Plan for De Minimis to Be Removed
Tariffs may still be TBD, but de minimis removal is looking very likely. This means all shipments into the U.S. under $800 could now be taxed — a big hit to brands relying on direct-from-China fulfillment. And it’s not just about cost: longer delivery times from China could lead to more refund requests, lower customer satisfaction, and fewer repeat purchases — all of which hurt your LTV and CAC efficiency.

3. Work Directly With Factories — Not Just Fulfillment Companies
Fulfillment partners help with logistics, but not your product costs. Good quality factories are very collaborative and will help you come up with ways to reduce your costs by purchasing certain raw materials or buying at certain volumes to help bring down your cost. From our experience, fulfillment and trade companies typically mark up prices by 30%-100+%

4. Consider Hybrid Fulfillment or Fulfillment from the U.S.
Consider taking a hybrid fulfillment model (fulfill from US and China-based warehouse based on location of the customer) or consider fulfilling directly from the US (bulk ship to US 3PL). Yes, tariffs still apply when importing in bulk — but there are ways to consolidate shipment to lower tariff/duty payment. There are 2 benefits - lower per unit fulfillment cost and faster delivery to the customer - which means fewer refund requests, which prevents your CAC from creeping up. 

5. Diversify Market (look beyond US)
Scaling into international markets (like the EU, UK, or Canada) can help offset U.S. margin compression. If you’re currently U.S.-only, you’re more exposed to changes in domestic logistics and trade policy.

6. Diversity Manufacturing (Where Numbers work out)
Diversifying doesn’t mean ditching China — it means adding a second factory base (like the U.S., Mexico, or Europe) for flexibility and regional fulfillment. This doesn’t apply for every industry, but for some industries like skincare and supplements, this is very doable. This can significantly bring down your cost due to the tariffs. That said, this is NOT a guarantee b/c of the changing policies. Manufacturing costs in the US are increasing due to greater demand and their reliance on China for ingredients and machines. 
-If you're targeting Europe, Australia, etc. you’ll need to still produce in China since the numbers make sense. 
-Anyone thats selling gadgets will still need to produce in China since the US is not set up properly, nor is it even cost effective to produce gadgets. If you sell apparel, you can explore working with other countries since they’re more competitive than China on price. 
(We’ve been working with a lot of skincare and supplements brands to set up U.S. production and making sure it makes sense economically— you'll need to carefully compare total landed cost, not just per-unit price.)

7. There’s No One-Size-Fits-All Strategy — You Need to carefully compare numbers
Every brand is different. What works for a $60 skincare serum won’t work for a $20 phone charger. A lot of what we've been doing with brands is to help them figure out steps 4-6 (fulfillment strategy, target market and manufacturing strategy) to optimize for cost and on-time fulfillment.  Make decisions based on your numbers — not someone else’s playbook. 

8. Review and Optimize Your HTS Codes to reduce cost
While the tariffs are applied across all product categories, they are not the same when it comes to duties. Sometimes an HTS code for a product falls under two HTS codes. One could be a common HTS code used for the exact product, but another could be used due to the products function. In some cases, like we’ve seen in the past, the difference in duties can be in range of 6%. If you’re importing large volumes of product into the US, the duties savings can be significant. 

9. Negotiate Better Payment Terms With Manufacturers
For those that have an established relationship with their manufacturer, try working on paying a 20% deposit for your order. Then paying 50% upon completion of production and paying the final 30% 30 days after delivery. If you’re placing orders valued at $300k, for instance, that’s $90k of money freed up for a month that you can put into marketing and scaling up your business. 

10. Smaller Dropshipping Brands Are Most at Risk; opportunity for medium-large brands.
Smaller businesses, especially pure dropshipping businesses (that are not focused on building a brand and scaling) are most likely going to die out with the de minimus removal. They'll have to pivot to selling in other markets, such as the EU, UK, Canada and Austrailia. This is a tough period for everyone, but could allow 8-9 figure brands to gain more market share in the US in the long term. This of course hinges on them having good control over cashflow and production cost. 

Hope this is helpful and stay strong everyone. Hit me up if I can be helpful with anything. I’m also going to be doing a live call with @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ tomorrow to talk about this stuff.

[11.04.25, 20:39:12] ~ Dayu Yang: hey everyone, we’re still seeing how the tariff situation plays out and impact on DTC China shipping. We have time though, as De Minimis is still in effect until May 2nd so anything that clears customs before then is still 0% duty. Next week I will make a formal annoucement on when we think the last orders should be sent out in order to clear customs before then. For now though, weirdly enough DTC china shipping is the only real way to completely bypass the crazy tariffs
[11.04.25, 20:43:39] ~ Dayu Yang: One more time sensitive note though: Everyone should STOP using epacket or china post for Alaska / Hawaii and US territories. Which is likely what you are using for those addresses as they are not supported by the usual private lines. 

Given the relatively slower speed of Epacket, we suggest you either swap to a private line (which is more expensive) or pause sales to those address starting next week.

[12.04.25, 4:18:15] ~ Mo: Im using 2 HK paypal accounts ( to disperse my funds, and not have all in one acct) , tried creating a 3rd acct but got terminated couple of days after. Anyone using multiple HK accounts ? do u experience same issue ?
[12.04.25, 6:48:08] ~ Farhat Godil: My EMQ score for PUR dropped from 9.2 to 7.2 - only thing different I have done is to started using TW Sonar for CAPI - Has anyone encountered something similar?
[12.04.25, 7:19:51] ~ Mo: u had wetracked before ? for how long u ben using sonar ? mine also around 7
[12.04.25, 7:20:31] ~ Farhat Godil: I was using shopify meta integration and TW just or attribution ‎<This message was edited>
[12.04.25, 7:22:38] ~ Mo: got it, im switching to wetracked for capi ( sonar doesnt work with funnelish) and i’ll keep TW for attribution
[12.04.25, 7:23:04] ~ Farhat Godil: I am reading lot of positives about  Aimerce thinking of giving them a shot
[12.04.25, 8:20:59] ~ Mike Ramsey: You will probably have issues if using same owner and / or entity details. HK accounts are way more flexible so if you blow those up and have issues that can cascade if you try to set up in other regions.

Payout reasons need to be clearly outlined and comply with AML policies. ‎<This message was edited>
[12.04.25, 9:03:23] ~ Mo: Yeah thought so, but i created my second acct using same company, same owners/directors and it was all fine no issues. so thought maybe i’ll create a 3rd one
[12.04.25, 19:55:01] ~ Cocow😈: But aimerce not compatible with funnelish I think 

I have call with aimerce Monday to see
[12.04.25, 19:55:53] ~ Cocow😈: I am thinking of using them for meta , and wetracked for funnelish
[12.04.25, 20:58:52] ~ Jeremy: Do you find that Triple Whale accurately tracks orders processed through Funnelish?
[12.04.25, 23:39:43] ~ Henry: Hey guys, wanted to ask for advice since we are scaling to other Big 5 countries instead of US. How do you deal with returns in countries you don’t live in? I’ve basically been having my US customer send returns to my home address because I live in US so that is easily covered. Not sure about other markets tho ‎<This message was edited>
[13.04.25, 1:06:17] Carlos Leeseman: We don’t let customers return the product. It’s just the easiest way for you and for the customer and the best for your customer satisfaction.

Don’t put on your website people don’t need to return their product, because then people will abuse it. But once you get a return request, just refund the money, because 9/10 times you can’t sell a returned product again. 

Or what we do is say get 70% refund and keep the product or return the product and then they also have to pay return fee’s themselves.

This is what we do ‎<This message was edited>
[13.04.25, 3:26:38] ~ Henry: Got it! We pretty much do something similar in the US right now by offering 50% refund as well
[13.04.25, 5:03:37] ~ Mo: i had some winning VSLs but got rejected, tweaked them to be compliant, but they are not as performing as the others. thinking abt hosting the VSL in my landing page , i see some brands doing same ( where they go a bit harder) . Would you recommend that ? any workarounds ?
[13.04.25, 15:04:07] ~ L: Guys how are you dealing with trump’s tariffs at the moment ?
[13.04.25, 22:36:22] ~ Jeb: It’s increased my product cost slightly. I make my own product and some of the ingredients are on the exemption list. Some are subject to the 44% tariff (china) but my supplier pays 29% and I pay 15% of it ‎<This message was edited>
[14.04.25, 0:38:19] ~ Patrycja: Hi everyone, does anyone know a good in house email marketing person? We currently use an agency and it’s not working for us anymore
[14.04.25, 4:30:02] ~ Mo: i have a long voice over , and id like to split it into small sentences, is there a tool that help with that ?

[14.04.25, 19:21:07] ~ Dayu Yang: Hey ESS community, I’m planning on two live webinars on the trump tariffs with a specific focus on impact on DTC order shipping from China. Open to EcommOps clients and this community.

[15.04.25, 1:11:48] ~ Ryan Leven: Use checkout champ ! I can make an intro to the owner
[15.04.25, 1:18:00] ~ Mohammed-amine: How much % revenue are they charging you?
[15.04.25, 1:37:47] ~ Ryan Leven: Half a percent… absolutely well worth it. I make a lot more money being on checkout champ
[15.04.25, 1:40:04] ~ Mike Ramsey: Isn’t it 1% < 1M per month?  Or has that changed?
[15.04.25, 1:42:45] ~ Mohammed-amine: how much rev to get this %?
[15.04.25, 2:01:28] ~ Jacob: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ Jacob
[15.04.25, 1:55:17] ~ Ryan Leven: Yeah 1% of rev up to X and then it drops, don’t remember what that number is exactly.
[15.04.25, 2:47:03] Matán Intsuper: A lot of money
[15.04.25, 3:14:01] ~ Matthew Martorano: It’s inconsequential if it increases all of your metrics.
[15.04.25, 3:14:55] ~ Matthew Martorano: As an example, a large essential oil company was converting at 2.3% and they are now 4X that.
[15.04.25, 3:25:35] ~ Adonis A: Is anyone here running VSL upsells? Can this be done on funnelish or anything aside checkout champ?
[15.04.25, 3:29:01] ~ Ryan Leven: I was previously running about 500k a month with Shopify and tried all of the apps they have for subs. 

When I got on checkout champ and had access to their funnel builder / checkout builder all of my stores jumped up to 1-2m per month. 

Not running on checkout champ is voluntarily handcuffing your potential
[15.04.25, 3:29:57] ~ JP Perera: Descript
[15.04.25, 4:09:41] ~ Bestfulfill—william: tariffs updates！！！！
trump started to shrink back after China confirmed we will not follow the add-ups of tariffs because USA products are losing their competitiveness with 125% of tariffs.
With the stress of high tech companies from USA having much higher cost of components from china, some products are added on the exclusion tariffs list. 
Big ecommmerce platform Amazon is heavily affected by the tariffs as well.
Deminimis Prediction !

Many logistic companies like yunexpress predict the deminimis will be postponed like last two times, this is just one type of the cards USA has to push China to sell TikTok to USA,  a little story about TikTok, its not only a high tech company but also a media channel or News platform. USA feels this news platform will heavily affect the culture of USA. Same with China， similar like Facebook is banned in 
China, so it’s nothing about business, it’s about culture invasion，that’s the reason trump wants to buy it instead of shein, aliexpress, or Temu. 

AS for our Ecommerce sellers, even Deminimis is cancelled, the affection is only based on product level. Adding 1-2 $ on cogs is much lower than Q4 shipping price raising up. Or can do lower value claim for example instead of doing $4 per product claim, make it into $2. 

True DTC brands should be having at least 30-50% net profit based on its revenue, if this tariff policy ruin your business, DTC owners should really sit down and think about  whether their products or businesses are for long term.

The future Ecommerce must be based on combination of technology like chips inside products or much higher product value. Or recurring revenue with supplements or beauty products. This is happening with Temu killing all the general stores drop shipping. 

Like I said before, nothing to worry about or someone told me he is gonna lower its budget to wait, I never wait something, I make a plan to get it,  one of the differences between successful people and ordinary people is they make decisions fast. They fail faster and success faster too. Come on guys, while others lower their  budget on ads, lets scale and dominate the market before they even realize its actually an opportunity. ‎<This message was edited>
[15.04.25, 11:35:14] ~ Allan L: Are there any new facebook pixel apps around thats not costing 200$ monthly?
Currently using WeTracked but looking for a cheaper alternative if possible :)
[15.04.25, 14:16:08] ~ Harvey: Guys anyone have a plug for ad approvals?
[15.04.25, 14:16:54] ~ Malak: I have bro but idk if he does it now since I am not in need anymore.
[15.04.25, 14:18:13] ~ Harvey: Can you connect me? Our guy is not doing it atm
[15.04.25, 14:18:14] ~ SM: Check out triplewhale brother, i have a 10% discount code for it too if you're interested. I pay 142 dollars monthly for it. Works well too.
[15.04.25, 14:18:27] ~ Malak: Sure bro, check your PM.
[15.04.25, 14:42:50] ~ Tom: Anyone got a good hk paypal rep that could check my account real quick? 🙏
[15.04.25, 14:59:07] ~ Bony Ghadiya: "Recharge" 

 And Appstle - Cheaper alternative
[15.04.25, 14:59:08] ~ Bony Ghadiya: You can find more than 67 free resources, including courses and guides, at this link: https://adaptive-dugout-51e.notion.site/67-of-the-Best-Google-Ads-Resources-19a3fbe9146e800fb039c0a5a3d3358b. 

Let @⁨~Steph⁩ know if any questions
[15.04.25, 14:59:09] ~ Bony Ghadiya: If there is no app or system between stripe and your subscribers, you will lose all the subscribers you collected if stripe bans your account unfortunately.

There are some apps and checkouts you can to use so you own your subscribers, 

 if stripe bans you, you can just connect a different payment provider and will still be able to collect MRR revenue.
[15.04.25, 15:37:02] ~ L: Guys we have a problem with Facebook, we set a country and Facebook sends traffic from other countries that are not selected 

Is it something you ever experienced? (We tested 15 different ad accounts so far🥲)
[15.04.25, 16:23:57] Matán Intsuper: Just on the first day or all days?
[15.04.25, 16:43:06] ~ L: Some ad accounts we left running for more than 1 day, some other turned off as soon as we noticed the issue
[15.04.25, 16:44:09] ~ L: has it ever happened to you?
[15.04.25, 16:44:42] Matán Intsuper: It always happens on the first day, Facebook sends bots to test your site. but from the second day it’s fine
[15.04.25, 18:36:24] ~ Jeremy: Hey guys,
PayPal decided to hold our funds today, and we're processing 50% of our orders through PayPal. They're asking for proof of fulfillment, which we're currently working on gathering. However, for some of the orders they’re requesting proof for, the shipping address is either incomplete or incorrect, so we haven’t been able to fulfill them yet.

1. What’s the best way to solve this so that we don't need to pause scaling?
2. How likely do you think it is that we’ll recover the funds within the next month?

We don’t have a backup PayPal account yet, and I’d hate to pause scaling because of this.

Any help on this is appreciated.
[15.04.25, 18:40:46] ~ L: Guys does it ever happen to you that all of the ads (basically) you test perform good in the ABO testing campaign and when duplicated in the CBO performance drop?

We’re talking about 3/4 ROAS in Testing phase 

0,5 ROAS in CBO Scaling
[15.04.25, 18:43:10] ~ K: get the adress asap from clients and until then dont submit anything. If they take too long maybe cancel them as well so you can just move forward if that works. They release pretty quick in my experience when they get the info
[15.04.25, 18:43:22] ~ John B: yeah happens to me a good bit, always make sure to launch 5 adsets in the CBO with the same best creatives, and duplicate this 2 more times so you have 3 testing CBOs to start and maximize your chance of it finding another good pocket of audience.
[15.04.25, 18:47:27] ~ L: So do you think it’s a delivery issue? 
I usually launch 1 CBO 5 identical broad Adsets with the same ads in each of them . 

but I don’t duplicate the CBO .

Doing that make me think you fix this issue by “changing” the delivery, right? @⁨~John B⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[15.04.25, 18:50:07] ~ Jacob: Guys there i know there is a tool to take a product page template from competitors in shopify and than modify it
[15.04.25, 18:50:12] ~ Jacob: What it called?
[15.04.25, 18:50:18] ~ Jacob: Someone knows?
[15.04.25, 18:50:47] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: When you dup 3x cbo and as soon as one gets a sale turn off the other two straight away unless others get a sale at the same time. Whatever ones underperform turn off and let the good performer run
[15.04.25, 18:51:37] ~ Jeremy: Thanks 🙏🏼
[15.04.25, 18:53:03] ~ JULIUS: Talking PayPal holds, are there any tactics to lift the reserve (20% for 60 days)
[15.04.25, 18:53:04] ~ L: Thank you,

 and you use that CBO as your scaling CBO meaning every winning ad that comes out of testing ABO will go in that CBO?

 or you make a new CBO every 4/5 winning ADS you find?
[15.04.25, 18:54:21] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: For me I use ASC’s to scale my ads but the duplication principle is the same. What works for some ad accounts may not work for others.

If I found more winning ads I’d create a new asc
[15.04.25, 18:56:21] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: In your case I’d create new CBOs with that amount of winners.

Just launched a new product in the same niche and it’s promising so may try CBOs again and using @⁨~John B⁩ method
[15.04.25, 19:18:32] ~ Mohammed-amine: Anyone has a plug on Checkoutchamp that can give us better pricing?
[15.04.25, 19:21:59] ~ L: Thank you , I appreciate your help
[15.04.25, 19:40:59] ~ Natasha Iris: I messaged you
[15.04.25, 20:39:51] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, we have little problem on META.

We are infected like all others with Facebook health restrictions and our domain is blocked, preventing us from using any event. Our current CAPI solutions still works, as they use their own domain for the events attribution, but this is actually not allowed and is also bad for the algorithm of the ads, which can decreases performance.

So 9/10 CAPI solutions, like Aimerce, etc are not usable for us because the attribution is through own domain, which blocked. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what we can best do? Creating new store is not an option and continuing to use our current CAPI solutions is possible, but very risky.

For example, is it possible to connect a second domain to Shopify, for Facebook only, without having to change the main/primary domain name?
[15.04.25, 21:24:53] Radek: Not sure if this is the answer you’re looking for, but restrictions are applied on the domain level, so basically the only thing you need to do is to send traffic to the domain which is not categorised as health and wellness. What we did:
1. Use new domain variation e.g. trybrand, getbrand, etc
2. ⁠Duplicate your funnel and get rid of any medical conditions, including in the reviews
3. ⁠Relaunch your ads to the new domain

You can use old pixel, you can use winning ads including medical condition. The most important is that website part must be compliant.

You will lose engagement on your ads but can rebuild it on the compliant funnel.

We’re not using shopify, but I am quite sure you can connect multiple domains to the store.

Hope it helps
[15.04.25, 23:27:59] Carlos Leeseman: Okay yeah this is easy for funnels, but not if you’re a brand and using Shopify.
[15.04.25, 23:28:00] Carlos Leeseman: But thanks!
[15.04.25, 23:42:40] ~ Andrei Chavez: This sounds interesting. So 3 CBOs total, 15 adsets total… do the adsets have a specific interest or all of them with no targeting??? 

What budget do you start with each campaign??

Also, how do you set how much to spend per adset?
[15.04.25, 23:58:42] ~ Jeremy: I'm working with a client that's affected by this too. We've managed to navigate this by using Triple Whale's Sonar and sending the custom event New Customer Purchase to Meta. This event isn't blocked by Meta and is triggered by any new customer purchase. We're now optimizing all sales campaigns for the conversion event New Customer Purchase. This set up works well and has allowed us to maintain the normal ad performance. Let me know if you have any questions about this.
[15.04.25, 23:59:44] Carlos Leeseman: What about other events like page view, atc and checkout? Those are also affected for us
[16.04.25, 0:00:51] ~ Jeremy: I believe you can send them too as custom events. But I'm not 100% sure. We only really care about the purchase event.
[16.04.25, 0:01:23] ~ Jeremy: Is it important for you to send these events? If so, I can check for you.
[16.04.25, 0:02:14] Carlos Leeseman: Yeah page view, ATC and Checkout are important as well
[16.04.25, 0:12:38] ~ Jeremy: Just checked, you can send these events too
[16.04.25, 2:04:09] ~ Henry: Hey guys, I’m looking to expand my brand into doing PR articles on magazines to get that “as seen on…” badge on my website. Does anyone know any contacts to get this done?
[16.04.25, 2:08:22] ~ Daniel: I have a guy, will dm you his number
[16.04.25, 2:33:25] ~ Cocow😈: Hi funnelishers

Anyone had issues with stripe working on desktop but not on mobile ? 

And having issues with paypal like error when we click on order ? (both devices) 

I am well connected to both stripe and paypal accounts. 

Totally new setup
[16.04.25, 2:33:32] ~ Cocow😈: Thankssss
[16.04.25, 3:19:28] ~ Santiago: By any chance does any of you has the Dara Denny course on performance cratives?
[16.04.25, 3:21:49] ~ Andrei Chavez: Can someone help me please. 

I have a campaign that is being profitable the past 2 days. Currently at $100 ad spend - 10 sales yesterday ROAS 3-4. 

It was a ABO with only 2 adsets: 1 no targeting, 1 interest.

The interest one became unprofitable so I turned it off. 

How should I scale? First attempting scaling
[16.04.25, 3:23:26] ~ Andrei Chavez: It is a health product. Funnelish store
[16.04.25, 3:40:31] ~ Mo: I see cheaper metrics cpc, cpm ( 50% cheaper ) and higher ctr when running same ads to funnelish vs shopify , anyone have an idea why ?
[16.04.25, 5:55:14] ~ Jeremy: I'm interested in this too. Can you please connect me to your guy as well?
[16.04.25, 7:10:54] ~ Mikael: you guys who run funnelish. are you using separate Pixels for each funnel?
[16.04.25, 7:18:08] ~ Andrei Chavez: I would say that depends on the kind of product.. I think its best to have a different pixel per niche.
For example: 1 pixel for health products
1 pixel for beauty
etc...

that is my opinion though
[16.04.25, 7:18:39] ~ Mikael: alright bro thx. Have you seen a difference with this?
[16.04.25, 8:02:23] Matán Intsuper: No
‎[16.04.25, 10:30:36] ~ Faris: ‎image omitted
[16.04.25, 10:31:57] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Nothing you can do just make sure you fulfill orders and don’t go above 1% chargebacks or they’ll extend the reserve
[16.04.25, 10:32:43] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Maybe ask them what % do you need to stay under
[16.04.25, 10:32:56] ~ Faris: Okay will do that thank you!
[16.04.25, 10:33:01] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: NP
[16.04.25, 10:38:17] ~ Jeremy: Also, consider processing orders in a third party checkout if they don't need to go through Shopify
[16.04.25, 10:38:46] ~ Jeremy: Or at least some of them
[16.04.25, 10:48:21] ~ Faris: Our stripe is banned, so we have no other option right now, but thanks, we'll look into it.🙏

[16.04.25, 13:59:03] ~ Mohammed-amine: Anyone knows a good lawyer in China?

One of our freight forwarders in China is currently holding 2 of our containers for more than 5 months and he keeps on asking for more money with different excuses
[16.04.25, 14:28:42] Carlos Leeseman: Hmm not specific a Chinese lawyer. Maybe @⁨~Avv. Isidoro Capuano⁩ can help you?

Or maybe @⁨~Bestfulfill—william⁩ knows a Chinese lawyer
[16.04.25, 14:30:05] ~ Avv. Isidoro Capuano: We have partners in mainland China. Feel free to dm
[16.04.25, 14:35:02] ~ Jeremy: I'm on zoom waiting for the VSLs Domination Call to start. Is it taking place today?
[16.04.25, 14:37:27] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey brother @⁨~Faris⁩, Shopify payments = Unnecessary risk in your business
[16.04.25, 14:39:36] ~ Faris: Yow @⁨~Wouter Akika⁩ I am aware of it, I am looking for other alternatives right now thankss

[16.04.25, 17:15:59] ~ Filip: Hello everyone,
Im planning to expand from the U.S. into a few European countries, and I wanted to ask what have you found to be the best translator tool, or app?

Also, just to clarify, creating a separate Shopify account/store isn’t really an option for us due to some existing software integrations. So ideally, we’re looking for a solution that works within a single store setup. Thanks in advance
[16.04.25, 17:16:17] ~ Jeremy: Same
[16.04.25, 17:24:31] ~ Cocow😈: Mmmmh, there are a bit of SEO implications, post purchase app cannot translate in few languages (i guess) and managing a few languages via klaviyo can be a total mess

I guess people use langshop, but i will think about the impact of business in expanding market and languages before doing this.
[16.04.25, 17:48:07] ~ Calvin: Transcy is a great solution

If you are using a theme like shrine though you may need to edit some of the translations in code, won't be a lot though.

[17.04.25, 1:13:39] ~ Dayu Yang: update on DTC shipping to the US: https://x.com/thedayuyang/status/1912626750669959415

Critical date is April 25th when Yunexpress and similar are expected to pause all normal lines. The DDP line will be operational then but it is NOT tested at scale so I’d advise caution, but we will use it of course for clients who are aware of the nuances. 

As of now everyone selling to / shipping DTC from China to US should be preparing as if De Minimis will be eliminated on May 2nd. Do I think that Trump will just pause it again? Maybe / probably. But thats not enough certainty to base your business around. 

Ill be running the first of a series of webinars tomorrow, information here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k0ST_UKQW7_1REvclnHlGL0J31I7HM3frE-nTGI2aMg/edit?usp=sharing

[18.04.25, 15:40:21] ~ Jeremy: Had a similar experience previously. It seems like your profile or some of your assets (pixel, BM, domain, card, page, IP) has been flagged by FB. So, opening new accounts with the same assets won't solve the issue. I believe you'll need to create completely setarate assets without any overlap to avoid this moving forward.

Obviously, we're assuming it's a good product that will work. Unfortunately there are a lot of stupid consumers out there.

[18.04.25, 22:56:32] Matán Intsuper: Everyone has to pass that

[19.04.25, 0:37:09] ~ L: They’ll lift your raise each month based on the revenue processed with PayPal
[19.04.25, 2:44:45] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Have some experience. Best way is customize your app based on the ones which already exist.  Connect to WiFi is basically a same process for many electronics like home camera. So they should have done it many times in their life.

[20.04.25, 10:21:50] ~ K: How do you start a scaling CBO? What type of budget? How many ad sets? How many W ads in each?
[20.04.25, 11:38:58] ~ Cocow😈: We do 

(Depends on market) 

Starting budget at least 150/200 or 10x your average budget on adsets in your abo testing campaign 

One adset with 3/5 ads that are validated (ROAS BE +20% margin or your target) 

You duplicate 4 times this adsets within the campaign 

And then some do , others don’t , but you can triple duplicate your CBO to finish with 3 CBOs , 5 adsets on each one 


And finally , you try to find the early sale. As soon as one CBO gets the sale you cut the others

[20.04.25, 19:44:10] ~ Lucky ਸਾਧ ਬੰਦੇ: Hey guys, I’m honestly frustrated with Meta restrictions .

After my agency accounts didn’t perform well, some experts in BBA told me to try using my personal BM instead. That wasn’t possible for me, so I bought 2 BMs.

One was pretty solid (from 2023, can share pixel, etc.) and had a €250/day limit with 5 ad accounts. The other one also looked fine, just with a lower limit. Every BM have 5 ad accounts. 

I started testing with the first one, spent around €60 — then got restricted. Support told me to try using another ad account while they check the issue. But even with fresh cards, the new ad account also got banned.

Support wasn’t helpful, just said they forwarded it to the next department. Then I got an email that looked automatic, saying they can’t reactivate the account due to “security reasons.”

Now both BMs have issues, and I’m stuck.

Do you guys think I should start completely fresh? Like new profile, IP, domain, pixel, BM — maybe even a new store? This seem like the both BM related to same Store and same FB profile.  Now there no more possibility to connect the support also, I tried to submit the Case but this is not possible. 

If anyone found a better way to avoid these restrictions, please share. I’d really appreciate any tips or ideas.
[20.04.25, 20:19:16] Matán Intsuper: Pay an insider to unblock your personal BM

Tomorrow's copy call is going to be about *reframing angles to increase prices.* 

90% of value is in perception not product. It is the feeling, emotion, and connection people make with your brand that makes them believe that your solution is so good it is more than worthy of the premium price point. 

Join me tomorrow 10am EST 3pm UK time for ideas, insights and strategies that will help you uplevel your existing product with words so you can charge more. 

See you there! ‎<This message was edited>

[21.04.25, 19:16:45] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. A bit of a dilemma -
I’ve been using mostly CBOs up to now, and last week decided to test ADV+, so I threw a few winners in there, including some that seemingly died in the CBO and were turned off due to unprofitability/not spending. 

What’s interesting is that in the new ADV+ campaign, the same creatives that lost money/aren’t spending in the CBO, are performing really well in the ADV+ campaign, so now I’m not sure what to do - do I run both, or do I try pushing more creatives in the ADV+ to see if that works better in my account?

Both had almost same sales, both profitable but my CBo went unprofitable for about two days now. Should I turn it off and let the other one running and maybe duplicate?

[21.04.25, 23:27:34] ~ Cocow😈: You want to say you have one CBO campaign and inside one Broad adset and one Audience adset right ? 

Maybe you can optimize on adlevel first , cause you may have an ad in the broad that is taking all the spend with bad results
[21.04.25, 23:28:52] ~ Cocow😈: if it continues like this 2 days maybe you should cut this audience yes. However broad is more scalable and stable i guess compared to audience so probably your audience adset will die sooner alone
[21.04.25, 23:34:01] ~ Andrei Chavez: Correct you’re right
[21.04.25, 23:36:03] ~ Cocow😈: if you have new winners, put it in the adsets to give a second chance. We just recovered and ASC+ that was doing really bad by adding new winners in it and cutting all the bad performers from last 30 days
[22.04.25, 1:39:57] ~ L: Guys how long does it take to Advantage + Campaigns to optimize and stabilize?

And lastly I figure I should AB test with more than just one campaign to get more data to really be able to make a decision… how many do you guys recommend AB testing on?

[22.04.25, 4:05:20] ~ Mo: i tried the the “unlock gifts with purchase” but hard to do on funnelish ‎<This message was edited>
[22.04.25, 4:10:08] ~ Jacob: you dont have so much options to visualize in funnelish
[22.04.25, 4:10:42] ~ Jacob: you can make the gift as a bump with 0 value
[22.04.25, 4:10:49] ~ Jacob: and than they check it
[22.04.25, 4:11:06] ~ Jacob: thats more or less the option you have in funnelish
[22.04.25, 4:11:12] ~ Jacob: not so much custmization
[22.04.25, 4:14:14] ~ Jacob: i just in my checkout added a text in top of the options saying: "with each purchase you get bla bla bla for free instead of X"
[22.04.25, 4:14:58] ~ Mo: fair enought thanks brother, will test those for sure !

[22.04.25, 4:15:37] ~ Jacob: my man
[22.04.25, 4:15:42] ~ Jacob: just put in claude ai
[22.04.25, 4:15:45] ~ Jacob: and ask what you want
[22.04.25, 4:15:49] ~ Jacob: it will give you the code in seconds
[22.04.25, 4:16:59] ~ Jacob: tell it "can you please give me the piece of code that the arrow is pointing so i can implement it in funnelish custom html part, please make sure it does not interrupt other parts in the page since it's a drag and drop system"
[22.04.25, 4:17:51] ~ Jacob: and than you can tell it to redesign it and make it look better than that
[22.04.25, 4:22:34] ~ Andrei Chavez: Thank you @⁨~Jacob⁩
[22.04.25, 6:07:21] ~ K: is this common? for me if i have 1 good day i know the next one will be bad. Somehow always happens
[22.04.25, 6:49:06] ~ Mo: anyone scaling on Tiktok right now what scaling method/structure work best ? ‎<This message was edited>
[22.04.25, 7:34:08] ~ L: How do you keep up with that? 

I mean it’s not sustainable for me.
One day I’m profitable while the following next day I’m losing all the profit 😅

Also I can’t figure out what’s the cause
[22.04.25, 8:19:28] ~ Reece Mander: Ads? Organic?
[22.04.25, 10:07:48] ~ Jeremy: The LP conv rate seems a bit high. I think you should move the CTA down on the LP.

You're letting people through too easily and by the time they get to the checkout, they're not ready to buy yet.
[22.04.25, 10:09:28] ~ Jeremy: Your LP conv rate will go down as a result but the checkout conv rate will go up. You should get a higher overall conv rate.
[22.04.25, 10:11:13] ~ Mo: Ads
[22.04.25, 10:13:04] ~ Mo: You right bro, i have multiple CTAs in LP even before they get to the end… will do so thanks man
[22.04.25, 10:14:06] ~ Jeremy: Sure bro. Let me know how this will affect your results.
[22.04.25, 10:16:00] ~ JP Perera: Hey guys! Has anyone seen success with any ai ad management platforms like madgicx?
‎[22.04.25, 11:57:29] ~ L: ‎image omitted

[22.04.25, 12:58:52] ~ L: only by removing CTAs in the first part of landing page?😅
[22.04.25, 13:05:27] ~ Mo: No did this too thanks to the bro @⁨~Jacob⁩ 🙌

[22.04.25, 13:32:21] ~ David B: *REFRAMING YOUR ANGLES IS THE EASY WAY TO INCREASE PRICES.* 

Hey guys. I've been keeping a close eye on the tariff situation and I know it's causing many of you headaches. 

Today's copy call is going to be about reframing angles to increase prices. 

90% of value is in perception not product. It is the feeling, emotion, and connection people make with your brand that makes them believe that your solution is so good it is more than worthy of the premium price point. 

Join me today 10am EST 3pm UK time for ideas, insights and strategies that will help you uplevel your existing product with words so you can charge more. 

See you there!
[22.04.25, 13:33:04] ~ L: Will you also send the link here David?
[22.04.25, 13:33:30] ~ David B: Yes sir. I can put the link here.
[22.04.25, 16:18:37] ~ John B: my supplier said the same thing but also mentioned many freight forwarders have already begun increasing their prices in advance of this date, my price went up around 2 dollars yesterday from 17.5
[22.04.25, 16:34:52] ~ David B: Hey guys. The copy critique call goes live in 25 minutes. 

I'm talking about how a mindset and angle shift can let you increase prices of your existing product. 

NOT TO BE MISSED.
[22.04.25, 16:48:41] ~ Austin: Sounds like a banger

[22.04.25, 21:37:49] ~ Andrei Chavez: guys, do you manage your campaigns with bought profiles? I just got my 2 profiles restricted and my campaigns are still running and are doing pretty good. what you guys do in this situation?
[22.04.25, 21:38:19] ~ Allan L: Thats why its important to have backup accounts attached to the BM/ad account.
[22.04.25, 21:38:55] ~ Allan L: If You have no other profiles on the BM/ad account, You might have to pay a insider to get it re-enabled, but if its the personal profile thats restricted that can be relative expensive
[22.04.25, 21:40:52] ~ Andrei Chavez: I put my wife's account as my main BM, should I keep buying more profiles or can I use mine?? since its same IP location it may have issues
[22.04.25, 21:49:08] ~ Allan L: I have my wife's account in as backup admin, but i dont do anything from that profile. Only in case I need someone to add  another admin to the BM in case something gets restricted. But I also keep my two other admin profiles VERY seperate. Residential IP address from a different country and different browser agent fully spoofed with full new hardware.
[22.04.25, 21:50:35] ~ Andrei Chavez: yes she is my backup admin, I got 1 of my profiles restricted yesterday and the second one during the night, I woke up and it was restricted, I am adding 2 new ones with different IPs now
[22.04.25, 21:50:51] ~ Andrei Chavez: do you keep the pixels separate as well or does it matter?
[22.04.25, 21:51:21] ~ Allan L: Great, way to go.

No, currently I dont have the pixels seperated on different BMs.
If my BMs get restricted, I´ll payup :)
[22.04.25, 21:59:12] ~ Andrei Chavez: thank you @⁨~Allan L⁩
[22.04.25, 22:11:13] ~ Andrei Chavez: my 3rd account just got restricted as well
[22.04.25, 22:11:29] ~ Andrei Chavez: how can I prevent this?
[22.04.25, 22:18:44] ~ Andrei Chavez: would it be the page they are linked to? the one used to run ads?
[22.04.25, 22:30:37] ~ Allan L: You surely have a link somewhere. Hard to say where
[22.04.25, 22:31:08] ~ Andrei Chavez: I’m not even scaling 🥲
[23.04.25, 3:07:02] Sina Bagheri: Hey guys I have an adset which is an EXACT copy paste of my competitor’s ad, even has their name in it lmao.

None the less it’s performing insane, 2.3 roas with $1.5k adspend, today it’s 4roas.

Im going to do ugc actor iterations on it to make it mine, but until then, what’s the chance of getting reported/banned because of this ad, or should I not worry about that and scale it to the moon? It’s at $300/day now
[23.04.25, 3:54:04] ~ Jacob: Its the same market?
[23.04.25, 3:54:47] Sina Bagheri: No, Different countries
[23.04.25, 3:56:10] ~ Jacob: Is he operating in the country u are in?
[23.04.25, 3:57:02] Sina Bagheri: No
[23.04.25, 3:57:11] ~ Jacob: Like, if he mainly operates in us, and ur ad is in netherlands, i wouldnt worry
[23.04.25, 3:57:50] Sina Bagheri: He’s uniquely USA, I’m top 4
[23.04.25, 3:58:09] ~ Jacob: Thats more problematic
[23.04.25, 3:58:31] ~ Jacob: More risky
[23.04.25, 3:59:36] ~ Andrei Chavez: Where do you guys get your FB profiles?
[23.04.25, 4:00:11] ~ Jacob: I dont think it worth the risk
[23.04.25, 4:00:41] ~ Jacob: Same language, big 4, he will get to ot
[23.04.25, 4:00:43] ~ Jacob: It
[23.04.25, 4:01:25] Sina Bagheri: Ok - I’ll keep it under $500/day and wait to source clips, it’ll probably will take about 2-3 weeks

Thanks
[23.04.25, 11:11:28] ~ K: Anybody know a US supplement supplier?
[23.04.25, 12:31:14] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Good news on the way ?

[23.04.25, 12:47:42] ~ Dayu Yang: not anytime soon i assume
[23.04.25, 13:31:02] ~ Allan L: You should change the video up a bit, You are riscing to get a big ass flag on your whole BM by using copyright materials.
[23.04.25, 14:04:08] ~ Jake: Hey guys,

We’re running a beauty brand in the EU (currently dropshipping) and are now looking to switch to a 3PL setup. Before we do that, we need to make sure all our cosmetic products are fully EU compliant — or replace them if they’re not.

Does anyone have a solid contact for an agent or service provider who can actually help with compliance and sourcing these products (not just sending fake certificates lol)?

Appreciate any recommendations!

[24.04.25, 2:30:55] Matán Intsuper: I’ve had issues with chase cards. Amex cards no issues
[24.04.25, 2:31:15] Matán Intsuper: Got my account restricted 3-4 times and for 2 weeks due to chase cards
[24.04.25, 2:31:20] Matán Intsuper: But Amex rarely any issues
[24.04.25, 2:31:22] ~ Guy Edan: Yeah I just tried my personal Amex for the test and in works 😣
[24.04.25, 2:31:54] ~ Guy Edan: Cause it was able to send a verification code to my email. Chase for some reason doesn’t do that which I guess why Facebook says they can’t verify it
[24.04.25, 2:31:57] Matán Intsuper: Don’t play with the cards too much, you’ll lose more from the restrictions than the points you can earn. Learned my lesson
[24.04.25, 3:12:42] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Tariffs updates!!!

If u are too worried about the tariff cost too much turbulence in your businesses, u need calm down and look at how history goes back to 1929. Will trump let it happen again ? Of course not, he is giving himself an out every few days, and saying he wants get the deal down within 30 days, Again, he is a business man, he probably know more about history than any presidents in the history of the US.

Will u still be profitable with tariff policy? If yes, go ahead, I am 100% this policy will be only temporary. 

If not ? Think how much u lose or gain in long term, FB cost is getting higher and higher, so whats your assets after all? The answer is data, with those data, u can work on recurring revenue or sell those people other similar products that they might be able to use. 

A little story about myself, back to year 2014, I was a sales man in a watch resell company selling on aliexpress, the store I manage have only 3-4 orders a day, and everyday I send a message to those new buyers and asking them feedback about the pocket watches they bought from us at $3 with shipping, a lot of them turned to be my life changing people like Robert nava, who is the first batch of coaches, many of u guys probably know him or learned from him.  So whats my point here? Treat your clients like friends, talk with them, they will stay with u no matter how,  several month later, the stores I manage reach 100 orders easily and within 1 year the I sell most of the pocket watch in the market, and all the pocket watches factories know my name even I never met them before, I am getting a lot of bulk orders even for thousands of dollars, remember its a 2-3$ pocket watch with free shipping, not only they buy pocket watches from me, they buy many other watches from me, wooden watches, mechanical watches, then I find out the truth of selling, talk with your clients and treat them well, thats how Bestfulfill started with no advertising but solving problems for clients and then words of mouth, last year 2024 we did 400m revenue.

Although my business is a little bit different from e-commerce brands but the logic is same, so if u are paying more to get a loyal customer with higher cost, are u willing to do that?
[24.04.25, 10:58:18] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Whats up legends!

[25.04.25, 0:34:10] ~ Guy Edan: Hey guys. We tried to change credit cards a few times and unfortunately ad account got disabled for unusual activity, probably for that. We contacted support and are waiting for an update, but in the meantime, would it be wise to run some ads on a different ad account?
[25.04.25, 1:02:58] ~ Jeb: Definitely, I think it’s wise to always have multiple back up accounts as you scale. We like to think we have control or know what we’re doing 100% but the truth is we can’t always cover all our bases. Having primed backups will help you sleep a little better. But with those new backups I’d try to use a different form of payment if possible
[25.04.25, 8:19:42] ~ P: Good morning, for those who ship with YunExpress, how much has the price increase in the US started tomorrow?
[25.04.25, 8:24:04] ~ Dayu Yang: Here’s an announcement and comparison prices on base rates we’re sending to our clients 
===
The logistics company has provided the latest DDP rates for the U.S. route. Since today's (April 25) order fulfillment will still be settled at the old rates, we will update your quotation sheet tomorrow (April 26).

To make price comparison easier for you, EcommOps will directly update the prices of existing routes instead of creating new ones. Meanwhile, we have provided the specific price increases for each weight in advance. See the data below for details.

Under the latest plan, both the Regular Line and Liquid Line now support DDP services, so electronics and cosmetics can still be shipped to the U.S.

However, it is currently uncertain whether the U.S. customs will experience significant delays or conduct stricter reviews on declared values after the new policy takes effect. Therefore, we recommend pausing U.S. order fulfillment starting from April 26 until May 6, after the May Day holiday. By then, we will offer further advice based on the latest situation.

We will proceed with the suspension by default. If you fully understand the associated risks and price adjustments and wish to continue shipping to the U.S., please notify us separately after this message.

Great to e-meet you all.

Built Reshop.com - have raised tens of millions from some of the best VCs in the US. Partially exited to the co-founders of afterpay last year. 

Excited to be back as a retailer.  Ready to scale even harder than round 1 w/ my brother (who’s smarter than me 🙂), Nick.

[29.04.25, 0:16:39] ~ Aymane: Hey everyone,

My name is Aymane, 22 years old from Morocco.

I’m a med student currently taking a gap year to go all-in on e-commerce.

Over the past year, I’ve built COD stores in the GCC and crossed $1M+ in total sales — I know that’s still small compared to many here, but I also know it’s just the beginning. I have a lot to learn, especially around scaling smarter and building stronger systems.

Excited to learn from everyone here and grow alongside you all!
[29.04.25, 0:23:32] Fabian: Welcome 💪🚀
[29.04.25, 0:26:22] ~ Andrei Chavez: I need some guidance when scaling. What is you guys SOP for scaling? 

Every time I increase my budget my performance drastically drop. How you guys scale? Increase budget at 12am? What % increase?

Thank you in advance ‎<This message was edited>

[29.04.25, 0:32:49] ~ Tom: did u try to duplicate campaigns?
[29.04.25, 0:33:19] ~ Andrei Chavez: I have only duplicated when the performance drops
[29.04.25, 0:33:39] ~ Andrei Chavez: Should I duplicate my campaigns at same budget instead of increasing it ?
[29.04.25, 0:34:42] ~ Tom: id try to horizontally scale if u get massive drop after increasing budget
[29.04.25, 0:36:01] ~ Andrei Chavez: How many duplicates should I do Tom?
[29.04.25, 0:36:18] ~ Guy Edan: How long did it run before u increased?
[29.04.25, 0:37:07] ~ Andrei Chavez: I have tried it with multiple campaigns:
2-3 days, 3-4 days, 1 day
[29.04.25, 0:37:33] ~ Tom: some people do x3 and wait till first sale before they turn the other 2 campaigns off
[29.04.25, 0:38:36] ~ Andrei Chavez: So create 3 duplicates and when I get 1 sale in either campaign turn the other 2 off… when should I create more duplicates after this?
[29.04.25, 0:38:48] ~ Tom: i usually turn off underperforming camps after 12 hours (rarely happens tho, when duplicating winning camps)

[29.04.25, 12:04:20] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: For anyone that’s spending 2k plus a day

Having some difficulty scaling and testing at the same time atm I feel my testing campaign either gets cannibilised by my scaling campaigns (asc) or else this is me just thinking that.

1. Scaling audience is 200m consisting of around 10 countries
2. ⁠I have around 8 test audiences (interests) of 30m+ each within that same 200m scaling audience.

I’m trying to crack this atm so I can get to 5k,10k spend a day

Anyone have a good system here that know either campaign won’t get cannabilised? ‎<This message was edited>

[30.04.25, 4:02:43] ~ Jacob: advetorial
[30.04.25, 4:02:47] ~ Jacob: thats your week spot
[30.04.25, 4:02:52] ~ Jacob: weak
[30.04.25, 4:03:05] ~ Jacob: try a/b test it
[30.04.25, 4:03:20] ~ Jacob: like i wouldn't even ab test it because it very low
[30.04.25, 4:03:22] ~ Jacob: just try new versions
[30.04.25, 4:04:24] ~ Jacob: but it's interesting , it's low but the conversion from the people who go continue from landing page is exteremly high
[30.04.25, 4:05:09] ~ Jacob: but still it's not enough it's better to have a pre-sell that will bring like more than 30% at least in my opinion
[30.04.25, 4:05:23] ~ Jacob: mine usually is around 50%
[30.04.25, 4:11:20] ~ Jacob: or try CRO your advertorial - add more CTA, maybe a sticky CTA Bar
[30.04.25, 4:11:41] ~ Mo: got that bro @⁨~Jacob⁩ its extremely weak. i'll work on it. if I double it , at least, this will have huge impact i think.
[30.04.25, 4:12:32] ~ Jacob: yes it is because its look people interested in the product
[30.04.25, 4:17:21] ~ Mo: i’ll work on it and update you, the CR lift in checkout thanks to you, appreciate you man !
[30.04.25, 4:18:22] ~ Jacob: 💪
[30.04.25, 4:22:29] ~ Jacob: Download this plugin: FireShot (if u use firefox) - it's a plugin that take picture of all your page - like long screenshot - than upload it to claude/gpt and ask it to give you suggestions for CRO and improving conversion rate
[30.04.25, 4:23:11] ~ Jacob: and also make listicle competing or something that is not advetorial
[30.04.25, 4:23:31] ~ Mo: i actually have a listicle not adv
[30.04.25, 4:23:40] ~ Mo: maybe i’ll try an adv this time
[30.04.25, 4:23:48] ~ Mo: will do for sure thanks G
[30.04.25, 4:24:56] ~ Jacob: interesting - look if in ur sales page - if there are some marketing messages that are exist in the sales page and not in the listicle because something there make them buy - and make sure your listicle is actually solving their potential objections from similar products in the market - ill put also all the listicle in gpt/claude - and ask it to research for similar products reviews and frustrations and pains and see if you can improve the copy ‎<This message was edited>
[30.04.25, 4:26:54] ~ Mo: got it , sale page kinda winning , so gotta have same messaging in listicle right.
[30.04.25, 4:27:53] ~ Jacob: not necesarly the same but bring them to the same conclusion and the sales page connect to it more naturaly
[30.04.25, 4:30:24] ~ Mo: got ur point bro ! upsells etc… not even a question/priority now right
[30.04.25, 4:30:32] ~ Jacob: no
[30.04.25, 4:32:28] ~ Mo: noted. to AB test an adv u duplicate the entire funnel right ? do u use any specific tools to ab test
[30.04.25, 4:34:13] ~ Jacob: what u use now?
[30.04.25, 4:34:27] ~ Jacob: just regular shopify?
[30.04.25, 4:34:38] ~ Mo: funnelish
[30.04.25, 4:34:42] ~ Jacob: ah its easy
[30.04.25, 4:35:29] ~ Jacob: just go to the funnel step that u want
[30.04.25, 4:35:34] ~ Jacob: and add a/b test
‎[30.04.25, 4:36:13] ~ Jacob: ‎image omitted
[30.04.25, 4:36:41] ~ Jacob: and divide it 50-50%
[30.04.25, 4:37:39] ~ Mo: clear ! i’ll have to build the adv in another funnel right, save it as a template and add it in the ab test right ‎<This message was edited>

[30.04.25, 20:28:38] ~ Kain: We see like 1 day good roas and the day after really bad
[30.04.25, 20:32:39] ~ Andrei Chavez: Does anyone have any idea why I only get sales from 0630-12pm?? after that I get nothing. What is your recommendation? this behavior does not let me scale my product. 
by 11am I increase budget because of good performance but I dont get sales after, maybe 1-2 max by 5pm

Also, my ad account has Hawaii timezone and targeting EU, so it resets at 12am (Hawaii time), but 12pm (EU time), do you think this is the reason of performance drop??

OR

1. Do you recommend me put a bigger budget and turn campaign off at 12pm??
2. Will turn a campaign off at 12pm and turn it on the next day will affect the performance?

What should I do, have you guys face similar situations?
[30.04.25, 20:33:33] Matán Intsuper: Try new ad account and new pixel maybe.. or maybe the product and market works those hours. You can do dayparting
[30.04.25, 20:37:17] ~ Andrei Chavez: can I turn off and on campaigns or start new campaign every single day??

definitely will try new ad account with EU time zone so it does not reset at midday when its performing good
[30.04.25, 20:37:38] ~ Andrei Chavez: this is the performance of my funnel at those hours

[1.05.25, 3:04:22] Matán Intsuper: But I’ve done this in the past, years ago

[1.05.25, 12:18:25] ~ Allan L: wetracked alternatives? 
Wetracked overcharged me because of their system refused a upgrade on my user. Their customer support isnt able to figure this out and doesnt really offer to take care of the overcharging, so I am looking for good alternatives.

I am kinda only using it for the facebook pixel tracking, so dont need other expensive features :)
[1.05.25, 12:20:19] Topi: dm i have great, cheaper and better

[3.05.25, 3:58:50] ~ Farhat Godil: Heard this from my supplier 

“UK will cancel the tax-free policy for parcels worth less than 135 pounds and impose a 20%-30% tariff on each parcel”

Anyone can confirm if they heard something similar?
[3.05.25, 4:39:06] ~ Mo: guys whats best way to compress videos then host them ( as video carousel) in my shopify product page for better loading speed… ?
[3.05.25, 4:42:18] ~ Luka: We use Wistia, it auto-compresses and optimizes. If the video is short and you want it to auto-play like a GIF, you can set the whole video to be a “video thumbnail”. 

On the other hand, https://videowise.com/ has some super fast speed for their videos but is $300/mo, and is more focused on shoppable videos.
[3.05.25, 4:46:00] ~ Mo: thanks bro yeah heard about wistia, will give it a try. currently using Tolstoy and its getting way too expensive around $400/ month now.
[3.05.25, 5:11:53] ~ JP Perera: What exactly is the purpose of videowise? To have floating interactive videos on your website?

[4.05.25, 14:28:21] ~ Jeremy: Quick question:
- Triple Whale and the Facebook Ads Manager show the exact same amount of revenue tracked, but they attribute it to different ads. In some cases, ads look very profitable on Facebook but perform poorly on Triple Whale—and vice versa.
- I’ve always based my decisions on the Facebook Ads Manager and only started optimizing based on Triple Whale data three days ago. Since making the switch, performance has dropped significantly, although the sample size is still small.
- Do you typically see much more accurate data on Triple Whale compared to Facebook Ads Manager? Would you base your decisions solely on Triple Whale?
[4.05.25, 14:31:19] Fabian: Hey guys, 

Anyone has a connect for a shopify developer? 

Quick job

looking for someone who keeps their promises
[5.05.25, 1:04:09] ~ Henry: Hey guys, does anyone have a referral for a good landing page and product page designer? I would like to completely delegate this part of my business to someone else as it’s a pretty low value task for me at this point
[5.05.25, 1:12:48] ~ Damjan Topalovic: anyone testing UK and CA?
[5.05.25, 1:12:54] ~ Damjan Topalovic: hmu
[5.05.25, 1:14:48] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Yeah UK was a high performer but has tanked recently. CA has been average. Australia really strong rn ‎<This message was edited>
[5.05.25, 1:19:14] ~ David B: The UK is in a bit of a mess right now because of changes to the tax regulation. The average person has less spending power. In times like these, people tend to gravitate back towards "known brands" and "household names" even if they are more expensive because they feel less risky. This could explain some of the performance issue in the UK. I predict it will stabilise soon.
[5.05.25, 1:19:49] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: What’s happening with the tax regulation? Thanks for this David
[5.05.25, 1:20:35] ~ Damjan Topalovic: appreciate it
[5.05.25, 1:21:36] ~ David B: Small businesses are getting hammered at the moment because of changes to the taxable thresholds. So if you employ people, you tax bill is going up. What that means is that a lot of businesses have now raised their prices passing on that cost to the end consumer.
[5.05.25, 1:22:12] ~ David B: The current Labour government is not very popular. They've made some very poor choices in my opinion.
[5.05.25, 1:24:35] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: This explains a lot cheers buddy
[5.05.25, 1:25:49] ~ David B: I don't want to spam up the chat so I've put all the info in this doc for you guys. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pQBuITMtxM_5Ifg7N77Is8kTn8CQh2-SjhzNORal6uY/edit?usp=sharing

But in short, people with money are getting hammered so they have to raise prices for the average consumer. Hope this helps.
[5.05.25, 1:35:43] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: It definitely does mate cheers! The world economy is getting shafted left right and centre rn
[5.05.25, 1:37:06] ~ David B: Yep. It's a real mess.
[5.05.25, 6:43:00] ~ Henry: I always base my decisions solely on triplewhale now. My FB conversions don’t even run properly bc I run a health product. Triplewhale is pretty accurate for ad performance tracking
[5.05.25, 11:11:45] ~ Daniel: Hi guys, anyone have a contact for a Meta insider who can change the company on a invoice?

[6.05.25, 20:23:22] ~ Natasha Iris: Hi guys — important update‼️

Our EU team has spotted a Klarna and Amazon Pay update that now shows a warning on a merchant's checkout page if the brand is considered high risk. The alert reads: “_Shop with frequent complaints_”

See highlighted screenshot below (brand info has been redacted).

🚨This will likely lead to lower CCRs and highlights how critical it is to stay on top of the main areas where we see customer complaints / CBs 

- Shipping delays
- Products not as described
- Poor communication around recurring subscription fees
- Orders seized and reshipped due to tariffs - causing delays (with no communication to the customer or your payment processor) 

Myself and the team are here if you have any questions about how to avoid triggering this alert on your checkout.

[7.05.25, 11:02:45] ~ David B: Hey guys! I have a favour to ask... 

It's been a loooooong ass while since I updated my testimonials so I'm on the hunt for new ones. 

I'd appreciate it if you could just take a few minutes out of your day to record me a short UGC testimonial. 1-2 minutes is plenty. 

Anyone that's worked with me and got great results. 
Anyone who's reached out for advice and hit homeruns. 
Anyone who's implemented the learning in my calls and improved results. 

A simple structure is. 

The problem you were having, 
What that meant for your business, 
Testing the idea or having me complete the work for you, 
The results and progress. 

Doesn't have to be anything clever or fancy. 

If you're willing to do this, PM me. 

Here's my toast to your success... 

 Here's to cheating, stealing, fighting and drinking. 

If you cheat, may you cheat death; 
If you steal, may you steal your lovers heart; 
If you fight, may you fight for a brother; 
If you drink may you drink with me.

[9.05.25, 23:40:34] ~ JULIUS: Great if you surf scale to keep track in real time
[9.05.25, 23:41:12] ~ JULIUS: Otherwise wetracked or similar software will have better tracking than Mets Shopify app
[9.05.25, 23:42:49] ~ Kim Romanov: So the WeTracked works as CAPI provider and make performance better?
[9.05.25, 23:50:56] ~ Cocow😈: Tw has sonar, it is a capi as well 

But yes , capi are necessary
[10.05.25, 0:37:41] ~ Miika: Why doesn’t every single person who checks out with Shopify see the post purchase upsells?
[10.05.25, 0:38:09] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: If they are a different currency than the stores native currency it won’t show
[10.05.25, 0:38:47] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: Put the post purchase on the thank you and order status pages this will solve the problem. CVR is actually really high if you optimise it well
[10.05.25, 0:38:56] ~ Miika: In us, still only a few are the upsell
[10.05.25, 0:39:00] ~ Miika: Oh thanks!
[10.05.25, 0:39:06] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: NP mate
[10.05.25, 0:45:27] ~ Aymane: Anyone here working on saudi arabia using local payments ?
[10.05.25, 0:55:07] ~ JULIUS: Heard they're working on game-changing AI agents features 👀
[10.05.25, 0:55:54] ~ JULIUS: And also Shopify Post Purchase Offers don't show when using express checkout payments (apple pay etc)
[10.05.25, 0:56:47] ~ Miika: So it’s better to try to remove express checkout probably
[10.05.25, 0:58:07] ~ JULIUS: I would do what Brendan suggested -> Thank You Page Upsells + Emails/SMS
[10.05.25, 0:58:56] ~ JULIUS: If you really want to optimize : split-test with vs without express checkout payments. Since it may negatively impact your CVR
[10.05.25, 0:59:09] ~ Miika: Thank you very very much 🙏🏽
[10.05.25, 1:55:57] ~ Mike Kasdorf: Anyone here have experience with BoomBoom Creatives (agency) for TikTok shop?
[10.05.25, 3:37:27] ~ Mo: how many creatives ( approximately) a full time video editor should edit per week ( videos of 1 to 2min long ) ?
[10.05.25, 3:43:07] ~ Umiddin: depends on ur spend
[10.05.25, 3:43:21] ~ Umiddin: my is making around 80-120 a week
[10.05.25, 3:49:01] ~ Mo: 80 -120 new creatives/ concepts or including hooks ?
[10.05.25, 3:53:43] ~ Umiddin: so, i do have winning hooks, he do 10-20 var of winning ads, also i test around 30-40 new ads a week with different hooks. 
and others are just new type of ads. 
main problem was product in hand videos, but now its not a problem, so, he can make even more ads.
[10.05.25, 3:56:56] ~ Mo: got it bro so 30-40 new ads damn that much more than what my video editor makes (he makes around 5 new ads per week ).
and how do u test this huge amount of creatives on meta ?
[10.05.25, 3:58:16] ~ Mo: well think it still depends on creatives and how skilled the video editor is but just wanna have a rough idea.
[10.05.25, 4:04:35] ~ Umiddin: Yeah.  Meta and tiktok
[10.05.25, 4:04:55] ~ Umiddin: Inthink its all about motivation
[10.05.25, 4:05:12] ~ Umiddin: For every winning ads he got bonus of 50 usd
[10.05.25, 4:05:23] ~ Umiddin: So this why he willing to make more and more of them
[10.05.25, 4:11:17] ~ Mo: Yes makes sense bro, whats ur approach when testing this much of creatives on meta ?
[10.05.25, 4:16:09] ~ Umiddin: Very basic. 
Trying to find ads that let me spend 3-5k a day. And they need to give me atleast 1,5-2 roas.
[10.05.25, 4:16:36] ~ Winston: where did you find your editor?
[10.05.25, 4:17:55] ~ Umiddin: Go to local job websites in central asia. Like kazahstan, uzbekistan, etc
[10.05.25, 4:25:05] ~ Mo: noted that ! bro we stormed up with questions 🙏 trying to scale with TT rn , whats us scaling approach ? im using cost cap and seem to be working pretty good but once i push above $400 it dips.
[10.05.25, 4:26:12] ~ Umiddin: Personal ad acc or agency?
[10.05.25, 4:27:09] ~ Mo: agency
[10.05.25, 4:27:15] ~ Mo: bestfulfill
[10.05.25, 4:33:31] ~ Mo: can i dm brother ?
[10.05.25, 4:33:48] ~ Umiddin: Yeah
[10.05.25, 4:34:10] ~ Mo: 🙏
[10.05.25, 18:23:40] ~ JP Perera: Hey guys! Does anyone know how to get the ad credits on a new Meta account?
[10.05.25, 23:44:16] ~ Kim Romanov: Are their sonar improves attribution?
[11.05.25, 3:48:47] ~ Mo: attribution is already great with TW without sonar
[11.05.25, 4:09:09] ~ Andrei Chavez: can anyone help me, what payment methods to setup for Norway?
[11.05.25, 4:09:53] ~ Mo: paypal , cc, klarna
‎[11.05.25, 4:11:31] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
‎[11.05.25, 4:11:32] ~ Mo: ‎image omitted
[11.05.25, 4:14:59] ~ Fabian: Klarna CC is the only needed, if you can get your hands on Vipps that’s really good but not easy
[11.05.25, 6:14:02] ~ Andrei Chavez: I do have Klarna already, what is CC?
[11.05.25, 6:14:12] ~ Andrei Chavez: Haven’t heard of Vipps. Will try
[11.05.25, 6:15:46] ~ Fabian: Cc = credit card
[11.05.25, 6:16:53] ~ Fabian: Might need a Norwegian company , I’m not sure. But it’s not required to be able to run successful store ‎<This message was edited>
[11.05.25, 6:21:15] ~ Andrei Chavez: Will an LTD work?
[11.05.25, 6:24:54] ~ Fabian: Some 3rd party payment proccesing provide it, direct contract requires Norwegian company
‎[11.05.25, 9:40:57] ~ Bestfulfill—william: ‎image omitted
[11.05.25, 10:24:00] ~ P: Hi everyone! Has anyone noticed that the product started really well with high performance for at least a month, but then it dropped? I would like to know how to resolve a situation like this
[11.05.25, 11:21:01] ~ Faris: There can be several reasons, I also have the problem now and with me it has to do with ad fatigue but you need to check all your analytics
[11.05.25, 12:07:33] ~ P: after 3 months you say it could be the advertorial? or is it all a question of creative? the cpc is basically similar though. what has changed is the store's CR
[11.05.25, 12:20:29] ~ Mo: Guys selling in the EU, when testing new ads , is there any limits in terms of cpc, cpm, ctr… where u juts know that something wrong, ads suck and they will never gonna make it…. and at what spend u keep them running before shutiin them down. ‎<This message was edited>
[11.05.25, 12:24:50] ~ Andrei Chavez: my CPMs are $7-30 and CPCs  $0.60-1.2
[11.05.25, 12:25:08] ~ Andrei Chavez: but I am still testing products though
[11.05.25, 15:44:51] Topi: Does anyone know good AI footage tagging software that actually works? 

Like tagging the file name or metadata with keywords ‎<This message was edited>
[11.05.25, 22:49:58] ~ Cocow😈: No that much impact on TW attribution i would say as this is their algorithm based on UTM. Capi helps only facebook ads manager.

 Then for sure, data of facebook metrics is « better » in Tw as well if you compare both plateform attributions.
[11.05.25, 22:50:50] ~ Kevin Krieg: Yea they are working on Moby , their AI agent, to be able to do some media buying for people. I hear its a huge thing.
[11.05.25, 22:50:56] ~ Kevin Krieg: Not sure when it will come out tho
[11.05.25, 22:52:10] ~ Cocow😈: it is already , but not using it hihi
[12.05.25, 6:40:36] ~ Mo: How u guys get ideas for hooks ( both visual + copy) i usually go to tiktok & see what went viral & reverse engineer, any other ideas ?
[12.05.25, 8:01:05] ~ Reece Mander: Gethooked is incredible
[12.05.25, 8:46:57] ~ Mo: Thanks man
[12.05.25, 9:59:34] ~ seth: hi guys, I'm currently using Loox for management on our store, it's billing us like $600/month and I think not effective so i'm looking for an alternative. Any suggestion? My requirement just it have intergration with google so product on our GMC can have reviews
[12.05.25, 10:18:17] ~ seth: all creative will have post id
[12.05.25, 10:18:35] ~ seth: only after it done review i think
[12.05.25, 10:19:48] ~ seth: post id is a combination of video/img + thumbnail + adscopy and data of learning saved in the thumbnail of that post id
[12.05.25, 10:20:59] ~ seth: when the ad is done review you can click "view on facebook post" it will have a code for that post id on the url, use that to fill in the "enter post id" section of ads
[12.05.25, 10:30:03] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Tariffs back to 10% now Guys
[12.05.25, 10:32:07] ~ Brendan O’ Connell: In China?
[12.05.25, 10:36:27] ~ Sonu Duhra: Their highest plan should be 300 USD and is unlimited. Which plan are you on?
[12.05.25, 10:43:43] ~ seth: the highest plan
[12.05.25, 10:43:52] ~ seth: It's charge based on usage
[12.05.25, 10:44:04] ~ seth: But i don't see it effective if i'm scaling
[12.05.25, 10:52:22] ~ JULIUS: @⁨~seth⁩ you're getting billed this amount because you're sending emails to existing customers to get reviews from Loox
[12.05.25, 10:53:08] ~ JULIUS: Work around would be to use the lowest plan and collect reviews thru Klaviyo, then import them with CSV file to Loox
[12.05.25, 10:53:44] ~ JULIUS: (Lowest plan = the plan needed for GMC integration)
[12.05.25, 11:00:27] ~ seth: yeah but i'm thinking moving to okendo is it a better app when scaling
[12.05.25, 11:32:21] ~ Andrei Chavez: quick question for a noob. My advertorial and sales page yesterday were converting 40-50%, today my sales page is 0% ‎<This message was edited>
[12.05.25, 11:32:45] ~ Andrei Chavez: you think because is Monday?
[12.05.25, 11:33:18] ~ Andrei Chavez: advertorial still 40%, sales page 0%
[12.05.25, 12:27:14] ~ Calvin: Is it not 30%?
[12.05.25, 12:28:42] ~ Bestfulfill—william: 30% yes just confirmed
[12.05.25, 12:29:04] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Tariff 10% plus the former 20%
[12.05.25, 12:53:27] ~ Jeremy: Two days probably don't accumulate enough data. I'd suggest you let it run longer to get a reliable average number. Some days, you'll get good traffic from Facebook, on other days, the traffic quality will be bad. Fluctuations are normal from my experience. How many visitors did you get yesterday and today? ‎<This message was edited>
[12.05.25, 12:58:32] ~ L: Guys I have to launch ads on another FB page (the old one will be shutted off) - do you think erasing/changing metadata of the ads will be enaugh?

(of course i’ll change domain as well)
[12.05.25, 13:05:32] ~ Calvin: Can't speak much for Meta but I would make some very minor changes to the lighting effects and add a song or audio on 1-2% volume on Capcut so that a human can't hear it. Would also trim the video by 1 sec or so. This used to help on Tiktok and the algo treated it as completely new ads. Given the sophistication of AI I think removing Metadata might not be enough if everything else stays the same
[12.05.25, 13:31:47] ~ F: does this apply for orders below 800 too?
[12.05.25, 13:37:52] ~ Santi Roa: https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/business/us-china-trade-deal-announcement-intl-hnk ‎<This message was edited>
[12.05.25, 13:39:38] ~ JULIUS: Okendo is great (I'm using it) but they use same billing method as Loox and others. But if you want "deeper" reviews with specific USP / Pain points it's great to use it
[12.05.25, 15:57:31] ~ Daniel: Hi guys, what software to you recommend for making a troubleshooting form for customers?
[12.05.25, 16:27:39] ~ Marko: Anyone that knows a good wordpress dev?
[12.05.25, 16:39:46] Carlos Leeseman: Tallyform
[12.05.25, 17:18:16] ~ Daniel: Thanks bro
[12.05.25, 20:32:20] Topi: Anyone in stockholm?
[13.05.25, 2:46:51] ~ Mo: looking to buy some instagram followers, anyone recommend a good seller ?
[13.05.25, 5:05:56] ~ Daniel: https://www.socialwick.com
[13.05.25, 5:17:25] ~ seth: what about the integration with GMC?
[13.05.25, 5:18:47] ~ seth: we use loox because of the integration with GMC it really push the performance that's why I still skeptical when finding a different app
[13.05.25, 7:23:02] ~ seth: Anyone run ads on all Shopify + Checkout Champ + Funnelish? I have a question, does putting all testing for these 3 funnel in 1 campaign affect the performance?
[13.05.25, 7:26:34] ~ seth: My structure is having 1 Master test campaign ABO, each adset have 3-5 creatives for 1 funnel (URL), but do i need to seperate Master Test for each platform? because I setup different domain and pixel for Shopify and Funnelish/Checkout Champ
[13.05.25, 8:51:46] ~ Sonu Duhra: The highest plan is unlimited, only the lower plans charge on usage. Unless they changed it for newer shops, but for my shops I don’t pay usage, just 300 USD and sending unlimited emails. ‎<This message was edited>
[13.05.25, 9:18:29] ~ Cocow😈: Loox tips: contact them , say you are working with them and that you are considering using klaviyo for the reviews. Talk about the fact you live loox product but because of what they charge you consider switching. 

I got 150USD for unlimited plan and they did me an offer for 200 USD per complementary shop (markets) so maybe soy can get something ;)
[13.05.25, 11:13:46] ~ seth: thanks
[13.05.25, 11:46:45] ~ Cocow😈: Does someone has a spanish proofreader that is good ? For a friend, thanks
[13.05.25, 12:04:53] Fabian: Hey guys,

[13.05.25, 13:16:57] ~ Bony Ghadiya: You can call Amex, get in touch with "global relationship department " and ask them to pre approve you for dubai if you have a good history with them in any other country, they will approve your first card
[13.05.25, 13:52:29] ~ Mo: Guys any idea why cpms jump from around 15 to 60 from one day to another ? ( beauty eu markets) day 2 of testing these creatives. ‎<This message was edited>

[13.05.25, 14:23:52] ~ L: From what I understand Facebook doesn’t allow us to check the feedback score anymore 
I use situation like this - or huge drop in quality traffic to understand if there’s something going on with the Feedback score
[13.05.25, 14:26:22] ~ Mo: Yeah when i click the page, i get nothing, it goes back to page where i have my fb assets…
[13.05.25, 14:26:40] ~ Mo: Makes sense so we cant check
[13.05.25, 14:27:18] ~ Mo: I have no idea because some adsets are fine some others cpms skyrocket ‎<This message was edited>

[13.05.25, 21:29:49] Carlos Leeseman: I think export again in Premiere Pro is enough, but not sure
[14.05.25, 5:45:17] ~ seth: cut 1-3s of the final part or small change then upload again
[14.05.25, 5:55:28] ~ Mo: where do u look for stories ( for ur VSLs, adv, better understanding of customer persona… ) apart from quora, reddit, amazon… ?
[14.05.25, 6:25:27] ~ Daniel: Youtube + actually talking to your customers through mail or phone
[14.05.25, 6:35:26] ~ Mo: got that thanks man!
[14.05.25, 10:20:19] ~ Andrei Chavez: Legends, can I use a post ID from an ad account in a different ad account? everything is under the same structure. same page, same BM. I am trying to get one creative with good performance in my new ad account.
[14.05.25, 10:47:51] ~ Denys: Hi everyone, have your suppliers already lowered prices in response to the tariff reductions?
[14.05.25, 11:03:20] ~ Ignasi: Yes. Do as you would in the same account
[14.05.25, 11:04:40] ~ Andrei Chavez: I was having trouble because it did not let me copy the post ID saying "it was created on a personal profile", ended up figuring it out though. Thank you!!
[14.05.25, 13:49:05] ~ Mo: i used to have a skype group where my CS and my agent communicate. skype is no longer available, any better altenatives ?
[14.05.25, 13:50:23] ~ L: probably Telegram, no?
[14.05.25, 15:08:11] ~ Bestfulfill—william: just use Teams, exactly the same, just name changed
[14.05.25, 15:18:31] ~ David B: Just be wary of notifications on Teams. It's fine... but sometimes it doesn't ping you and you don't want to miss stuff. 

I've transitioned some client to Google Chat and that's working well for me.

[14.05.25, 22:57:48] ~ L: Guys Facebook CPC on VSLs is 1$ 

Advertorial to product page -> 35%

Once in the product page people don’t even add to cart .

What would you focus on?
The offer Isn’t even that bad imo.

We’re just starting in the US
[14.05.25, 23:00:07] ~ Andrei Chavez: Maybe the copy doesn’t resonate with customer avatar?
[14.05.25, 23:40:29] ~ Jeremy: Seems like people are interested in your product but still have open questions/ aren't sold enough when getting to your PDP. 

Is your CTA button high up in your advertorial? Of so, I'd recommend moving it down so that people need to consume more content before seeing your price/ being asked to ATC ‎<This message was edited>

[15.05.25, 7:23:28] ~ seth: maybe showing the price too early, you can try setup hotjar or clarity to check customer behaviour
[15.05.25, 10:15:51] ~ Cocow😈: Hello everyone

For the moment we have tracking issue with funnelish on Meta (overtracking). We are solving it but in the meantime, we were wondering how Triple Whale is able to do the job correctly on attribution ? 

If anyone can share please. 

Furthermore, if you use triple whale for funnelish, which attribution model do you use to take decisions ads ? 

We see last click is shitty, but first click is really great because probably a lot of people finish the purchase in the webshop after google search.

For context we’re spending 500k/month , 1m/mo in peak months. Any insights or connections appreciated ‎<This message was edited>

[16.05.25, 7:08:47] ~ Jeremy: Using triple attribution leads to overreporting as each channel touchpoint gets 100% credit. I'd suggest using linear paid, we've been using this for a long time and it serves us well. With linear paid, the sale gets divided by each paid channel involved in a purchase.

Hey guys. I see a lot of talk about VSLs and whenever I ask what you're all needing help with, VSLs is always top of that list. 

After writing literally hundreds of them I can tell you now that MOST of the advice out there is complicated as sh*t. 

Writing VSLs is not hard when you know how and there are a few ways you can make it a lot easier for yourself. 

1. Get the research done properly first. 
2. Decide on what type of VSL you are writing. 
3. Write how people actually talk. If you wouldn't say it in a conversation, don't write it. 

Tomorrow's call will be focused on how to write a BAB (Before - After - Bridge) VSL.

These VSLs are perfect for people in the pain niche, supplement niche, skincare and wellness niche - anywhere where there is a promise of a transformation. 

I will go through how to do the research, how to structure the VSL and how to write one on tomorrow's call. 

If VSLs take you a week to write, if you feel like there's something "off" about them, or if chat GPT is making your ads sound like an 1950s infomercial...

Be on the call... It will completely transform how you approach VSL writing.

[19.05.25, 15:00:27] ~ Jacob: You tried chargeflow or chargeblast?
[19.05.25, 15:00:49] ~ Jacob: Chargeflow actually have option when they fight disputes for u
[19.05.25, 15:07:14] ~ Jacob: Got it — you want to keep running Airwallex on your main funnel, while warming up Stripe on a separate funnel, both at the same time. That’s actually a smart and low-risk approach, as long as you follow these key principles:


---

Here’s what I recommend:

1. Keep them in separate funnels

Use Funnel A with Airwallex (your main converting funnel)

Use Funnel B with Stripe (test/warm-up funnel)

Don’t mix payment processors on the same funnel to avoid cross-data confusion


2. Use the same ad account only if:

You’re reusing the same pixel for both funnels (with different events like Purchase_Stripe, Purchase_Airwallex)

You’re confident in your ad structure and segmentation


> But ideally, create a separate ad account for the Stripe funnel to keep data 100% clean, especially if you're warming up with different angles, products, or avatars.



3. Stripe warm-up strategy (safe method):

Start with low-ticket offers or lead-gen + $7–$29 offer

Keep the first 10–20 transactions manual (real card usage) if possible

Slowly increase volume to 20–30/day after a week

Avoid subscription or rebill until the account is stable


4. Domains and branding

Use a different domain or subdomain for the Stripe funnel (not the same checkout URL as Airwallex)

Stripe’s fraud detection is domain- and behavior-sensitive, so separating traffic is key



---

Why this works:

Meta’s algorithm won’t get “confused” if you’re not mixing checkouts/pixels

Stripe will be warmed up with real user behavior, under low pressure

You reduce risk of sudden freezes that could kill your main funnel



---

If you want, I can help you create a specific Stripe-warming mini funnel (offer + structure) to run parallel to your main funnel. Just tell me your product type or niche.

[20.05.25, 4:16:05] Matán Intsuper: those results mean your site is slow
[20.05.25, 4:21:56] ~ Mo: ive checked some other 9 fig brands and they have basically same metrics so not sure tho
[20.05.25, 4:23:27] ~ Luka: Site speed matters. FCP (First content printful) is important, it’s basically how fast the first visuals load. Use apps/plugins to speed up your website and play around with the settings. We’re on Woocommerce and use NitroPack, it’s the best from what we’ve tested.

Look at GTMetrix, select FCP and analyze what you can optimize. That will give you the big initial performance boost. And then optimize the other stuff.
[20.05.25, 4:27:41] ~ Luka: Tools like NitroPack/Plugins generally optimize the front-end. If your store has a lot of backend stuff that works (like dynamic images, sliding cart, this, that) you’ll want to fix that in general. For us what we just did yesterday actually was move our site WP site to Cloudways with a powerful server on AWS in a location near our main target audience to improve TTFB since the latency will be significantly less. However, if you’re on Shopify then then you don’t have to worry about hosting since Shopify is your host ‎<This message was edited>

(We operate dropshipping from outside UK and our owner is not UK and does not live in UK)


Can you please describe what kind of business operations you currently have in the UK? 

Shopify has to follow regulatory and contractual obligations which require that we only provide financial services to merchants who are physically located in a supported region. Shopify’s standards for this requirement mean that registering your business in the region and obtaining a bank account is not enough.

To be eligible for Shopify Payments, you must meet one of the following criteria:

If you are a Sole Proprietor, the business owner must personally live in the country.
If you are a Company, LLC, or similar business type, you must be registered with the government of that country, and also be able to provide evidence of substantial operations physically happening there.

If you believe your business meets these requirements, please reply here with a detailed description of your operations in the UK.

Some examples of operational presence could include (but are not limited to): You rent or own warehouse space and ship your orders from there, you have an office there with employees consistently occupying the space, or you have a retail location(s) there. You may have other examples of operations you have in the country which you’d like to provide: If you can respond with as much detail as possible, that is helpful for our review.

If you operate the business entirely from outside of the UK, you can confirm this also.
[20.05.25, 21:12:07] Carlos Leeseman: We have UK company as well for our European payment processors. However it’s a LLP and not a LLC, so probably that’s the difference
[20.05.25, 21:13:23] ~ Mikael: This is an LTD. But we also have more LTDs without this issue. So its super weird
[20.05.25, 21:14:16] Carlos Leeseman: Hmm interesting, as for I know it shouldn’t be a problem. Maybe you can try to add nominee in your company with 0% rights
[20.05.25, 21:16:01] ~ Mikael: We have UK LTDs with chinese nominee and these are fine.

But now when we do everything right from the start we have these issues 😂😄

[21.05.25, 17:45:38] ~ L: Guys, we’re having a problem here. Basically, every product we launch in this BM just doesn’t take off.
And the strange thing is, we don’t even get any ATCs.

Now, I’m usually against blaming the assets (ad accounts, BMs, pages, etc.), but it really feels like nothing launched from this BM can gain traction.

Since switching BMs would be a bit tricky for us, I wanted to ask if any of you have ever been in a situation where blaming the assets actually turned out to be the right call

[21.05.25, 20:26:32] ~ Jeremy: You'll have to use a CAPI tool that can send custom events for purchases to your pixel. For shopify, Triple Whale's Sonar works well. For Funnelish, Aimerce is great. ‎<This message was edited>
[21.05.25, 20:27:14] ~ Farhat Godil: Ok I have triple whale sonar - so should I still use the purchase event or new purchase event?
[21.05.25, 20:35:42] ~ Jeremy: You should switch to new customer purchase

[21.05.25, 22:24:36] ~ Ziga: Hi Everyone! Quick question: how do you guys implement post purchase upsells with Klarna markets in the EU? Is there a workaround to make the experience seamless, like with CC? So the customer only clicks YES and gets charged? I am using Funellish… Thanks!

[23.05.25, 13:11:04] ~ Bestfulfill—william: as long as you prove your profile is not bought but your own ones, should be able to get it back
[23.05.25, 13:49:19] ~ Andrei Chavez: Question, my current ad account (by ad agency), gets spending issues sometimes in which there are times it does not spend and couple of times it spends big chunks all of a sudden. The agency created a different ad account in a different BM that apparently they say it is more stable and does not have spending issues. 

I have multiple campaigns running in this ad account. Moving to a different ad account and creating new campaigns will affect anything if I use the same pixel? Or I should expect the same performance because of the pixel?

Please note that I am still a newbie. ‎<This message was edited>
[23.05.25, 14:09:27] ~ Jamie Melia: You do see some different behaviour patterns between ad accounts - this is hard to explain or quantify.
But the main thing is having that dataset/pixel available, that will help maintain your performance.

There is some ad-account level optimisation going on, so you lose this, but over time if your ads are compliant and successful you will get back to where you were
[23.05.25, 14:12:05] ~ Andrei Chavez: thank you @⁨~Jamie Melia⁩ , definitely going to hurt some momentum now that I am finally seeing some numbers; but it will be better in the long run not having to deal with these issues in the future I guess. thanks boss

[26.05.25, 12:03:13] ~ Miika: How do you guys do the pmax campaigns, do you exclude all other products in it or just let the main product stay?

My main campaign, has content (images etc) for 1 product but all the other products are still showing in the shopping ads in the pmax. Forgot to exclude the other products. 

Just wondering if you do 1 product per campaign when really scaling
[26.05.25, 12:35:02] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Great question!

There are a couple of ways you can structure Performance Max (PMAX) campaigns — and it really depends on how many products you're running and what your goals are.

If you're scaling and you’ve found a clear winner product, then yes — it’s a good idea to run a dedicated PMAX campaign just for that product. That way, your creative, assets, and data signals are fully aligned with that product, and you avoid diluting performance across unrelated items.

However, if you're working with multiple products (like different collections — e.g. t-shirts, pants, etc.), a more effective approach is to group similar products or product categories into one PMAX campaign. PMAX is great at covering the full funnel — TOF, MOF, BOF — and when products are related, Google can use shared signals to optimize across them better.

But if your campaign is only built around one product’s creative and messaging, and the rest of your catalog is showing in shopping ads, it’s definitely a good idea to exclude the unrelated products. That ensures your ad messaging stays relevant and performance isn’t dragged down by products that don’t align with your assets.

TL;DR:
✅ One product per PMAX = great for scaling winners
✅ Grouped PMAX by category = efficient for broader product lines
❌ Mixing unrelated products = can hurt performance, especially if assets are tailored to just one item

Hope this helps!

[31.05.25, 23:12:04] ~ JULIUS: Anyone in Panama 🇵🇦 ?
[31.05.25, 23:46:24] ~ Djamel Bettahar: Anyone have a contractor that can fix Meta tracking on funnelish?
[1.06.25, 1:12:53] Topi: I know ex meta tracking engineer, not sure if she can do it but dm if want intro. At least checkout champ was no issue
[1.06.25, 2:56:53] ~ Djamel Bettahar: Thanks T, I’ll dm you
‎[2.06.25, 11:27:48] ~ Andrei Chavez: ‎image omitted
[2.06.25, 13:55:05] ~ Jamie Melia: This normally comes as a result of things like: 
- Fraudulent transactions (e.g., stolen credit cards)
- ⁠Chargebacks
Do you have any alerts or notifications in your Stripe account related to this? Normally you can submit an appeal, and you should provide info around the sale showing that you also fulfilled it. Things like ChatGPT can also help you write any emails to Stripe to help with the appeal.
[2.06.25, 14:17:30] ~ Andrei Chavez: I have only received 3-4 chargebacks so far, no alerts or anythings. I did send an email, they want me to submit this:
‎[2.06.25, 14:17:48] ~ Andrei Chavez: ‎image omitted
[2.06.25, 14:18:28] ~ Andrei Chavez: I was told I shouldn’t be worry about VAT registration certificate yet unless I’m making over 90k…. So I got hit on that, I should requested it
[2.06.25, 14:25:41] ~ Jamie Melia: That’s a standard list… if you do not have to be VAT registered yet then don’t worry…. Is your business a UK LTD then? Sounds like UK rules you just quoted. But also remember VAT registration in the UK takes like 2 months, so make sure you do it with enough time before you hit the 90k threshold
[2.06.25, 14:27:57] ~ Jamie Melia: Yeah for sure…3-4 chargebacks isn’t huge, but it all depends on amount of time you are running. Definitely keep in touch with them and make it very clear you are running an honest business and have proof of sales and fulfillment/delivery. Also if you have some fraud detection - like Shopify offers by default, if you reach out to the customers on Fraud risk orders is good to show too.

Refunding customers who are victims of fraud is fine your end, but if they didn’t contact you then that’s not really on you.

Hope Stripe co-operate with you here, these problems are annoying af
[2.06.25, 14:29:15] ~ Andrei Chavez: I will submit what I have then. Hopefully no issues, they mentioned refunds on the Stripe email. Hoping they don't mean all of the orders...
[2.06.25, 14:29:42] ~ Jamie Melia: Should just be for transactions flagged as fraduluent or unauthorised....
[2.06.25, 14:33:25] ~ Andrei Chavez: Yeah, not sure how to spot frauds from Funnelish... This account running since April, pretty new, I was told not to generate much at the beginning but not sure if that really mattered. these last couple of weeks I started having my first 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k days... I got too excited and then I noticed lots of sales failing, checked my stripe and I noticed it
[2.06.25, 14:34:27] ~ Andrei Chavez: good thing I caught it right when it happend otherwise all my daily budget would have gone to waste
[2.06.25, 14:37:18] ~ Jamie Melia: Having a back up proccessor may be a good idea.
I think with Funnelish you have less Fraud detection - you will mostly rely on Stripe to provide this
[2.06.25, 14:44:00] ~ Andrei Chavez: I will have to for now I guess. I will work on it. thank you for the advice and help Jamie! have a great day! I am going to bed now
[2.06.25, 14:57:06] ~ Jeb: Should be illegal. Maybe try a processor that’s a bit more white glove?
[2.06.25, 15:14:08] ~ F: Quick question for anyone selling to Europe from a US-based LLC, do you actually pay VAT? I’ve heard that legally we’re supposed to, but in practice, most people don’t. Is that true? Should I be paying VAT? Or I should only worry after hitting a certain threshold?
[2.06.25, 15:14:39] ~ Ziga: +1 would like to know everyones opinion
[2.06.25, 15:19:12] ~ Allan L: Normally like 60-90 days back on credit card payments. Reach out to isidoro from the group ASAP. He can stop it in most cases
[2.06.25, 15:21:24] Topi: The treshold for most countries is 0€ so you become responsible paying it the moment you start, however it’s collected afterwards

If you dont pay it, i think no one wants to ever buy your company or it limits the buyer pool a lot

The payment processors are required to report your sales to gov so basically they know if you paid it or not
[2.06.25, 15:22:18] ~ Andrei Chavez: ‎This message was deleted.
‎[2.06.25, 15:22:36] ~ Ziga: ‎image omitted
[2.06.25, 15:22:40] ~ Andrei Chavez: Payments were from Klarna though? Does this count?
[2.06.25, 15:23:07] ~ Ziga: I am an EU citizen with US LLC
[2.06.25, 15:24:19] ~ L: Me too, does Hong Kong companies represent a workaround? 

It does for many people, don’t know how and why tho
[2.06.25, 15:30:51] ~ Ziga: There are certain structures that people use. Coach Akos can help you with that.
[2.06.25, 15:49:33] Topi: Maybe its changed, this was the case 2023. At some point there were thersholds but most of them got removed

Anyways theres no legal way to go around vat, only ways to try not to get caught
[2.06.25, 16:00:19] ~ Nico Neumann: These are thresholds within specific countries, if you have a company there and only sell inside that same exact country. 

In general for most EU companies threshold is 10.000€ when they sell to another EU country. 

So let’s say you sell from Austria company to Belgium the threshold is 10k.

For non EU companies threshold should be nil. ‎<This message was edited>
[2.06.25, 16:10:09] ~ F: so just to be sure, even from a us llc, it is not recommended to sell to europe unless you pay vat?
[2.06.25, 16:10:36] ~ F: idk why but Ive been told by multiple people from US that everyone does it and absolutely no one pays or cares about vat
[2.06.25, 16:11:26] Topi: I think people who are bulding legit sellable businesses do pay it
[2.06.25, 16:13:48] ~ Jeb: I hate paying sales tax, but I do it 😂

Are Facebook VSLs also suitable for YouTube, or are there precautions and changes to be made? I imagine that ad hoc videos need to be created for shorts as well.
[2.06.25, 21:05:06] ~ Daniel: Hi guys, looking for someone who is specialized in creating custom app scripts for Google workspace - does anyone have a contact for that?

I spoke to Stripe support team and they said they will look into that, have you guys experienced this, were you able to enable Klarna back?
[3.06.25, 13:39:11] Carlos Leeseman: Anyone here has a solid creative strategist and iteration system?

Right now, we test quite a lot of concepts and variations and are looking for a way how to track and analyze the iterations and create new hypothesis based on the results.
[3.06.25, 14:50:57] ~ L: Guys have you experienced Meta spending 4x the scheduled budget ? 

It happened twice last week . 
It spent 4k on a 1k budget campaign like it was nothing.
In other campaigns it spent the whole budget in just 15 minutes
[3.06.25, 15:56:49] ~ David: My account spends 20/25% more max some days but not more
[3.06.25, 15:57:37] ~ Allan L: Hell, a few days ago I launched a new campaign on a old account, it spends like 5% of the budget.
Cant get it to spend more atm

[3.06.25, 22:37:23] ~ L: Guys when you write advertorials it’s all about 3 key elements (in my opinion)

- Headline
- Lead
- ⁠mindset with which they land on the advertorial (which also has a lot to do with the hook and the lead you’re using in your ads since a lot of people don’t watch the whole VSL) 

So if the advertorial doesn’t convert well I would look into these 3 factors
[4.06.25, 1:50:55] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Is the ad manager font different for you guys or did somebody put something in my creatine?
[4.06.25, 1:57:04] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Jajaja I think it’s the creatine👀 All good on my end.
[4.06.25, 3:31:56] ~ Guy Edan: Anyone worked with them? https://videoadsfx.com/
[4.06.25, 11:15:21] ~ seth: Hey team, quick question for anyone using GemPages for advertorials:
How are you setting up funnel performance tracking?

I’m currently running advertorials on a separate domain using GemPages’ Instant Landing Page feature, but my product page is hosted on my main brand domain. This setup is causing tracking issues — would appreciate any tips or solutions you've found.
[4.06.25, 13:00:26] ~ Luka: Can anyone connect me with a reliable and experiecned Chinese agent? We need someone who can handle sea freight, get quotations for products we need and so forth.

[4.06.25, 16:58:39] ~ Austin: Does anyone in here know Rumble ads or X ads? If so please DM, I plan to launch today for the first time.
[4.06.25, 17:01:16] ~ Austin: Also guys DONT SLEEP on IMAGE ads...I just launched 10 after a year with this brand and they've held a 80% hit rate and better then KPI....also I'm testing them all between 3 different PDP's and seeing drastic result swings, so maybe test that too.
[4.06.25, 17:10:31] ~ Luka: Our best image ad has $200-$300k ad spend, crushes continuously. It does help a lot if you have positive comments  (like any ad though). You can get hundreds of image ads made monthly. On top of that, you can make a lot of split-tests of each image ad (headlines, different visuals etc).

Use tools like https://www.creativeos.com/ & http://worldsbestads.com/ to get thousands of Figma & Canva ready templates
[4.06.25, 17:13:52] ~ Luka: How To Turn Your Designer Into a World Class Copywriter
-> Download top 15-20 copywriting books
-> Ask Gemini to summarize every book in great detail to get a 80-200 page book. Make sure to get it to include all the key concepts, templates, strategies, foundations, ideas, scripts, theories, explanations etc in great detail book by book.
-> Now you have a great copywriting PDF to upload for any prompt

Give it to your designer, and every new ad they design have them upload the image along with the PDF with the prompt to model it for your product ‎<This message was edited>
[4.06.25, 17:14:34] ~ Luka: And now you can consistently generate hundreds of image ads every month with great copywriting pretty much fully automated
[4.06.25, 17:18:12] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey everyone! I want to introduce you to our newest partners, Zendrop. They operate two large warehouses in China with a team of over 500, with a U.S.-based support team of English speakers. We personally use them for our fulfillment operations and have found their sourcing and logistics process to be incredibly transparent, reliable, and easy to work with.

Everyone in this group will be assigned a dedicated quoting agent with custom pricing, access to product customization, and ad agency accounts and more. They approach fulfillment like consultants — helping you optimize costs and scale effectively, rather than just maximizing their own margins.
If you have any questions or want help getting started, feel free to ping @⁨Shayan⁩ directly.

[4.06.25, 17:27:32] ~ Austin: What's your split of images to video? and do you find the offer based image ad or product explanation image ads work best?
[4.06.25, 17:28:56] ~ Luka: it's about 50/50, and that's also considering our hero product does require education. But the advertorial takes care of that

[5.06.25, 22:43:53] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey brand builders. I met a guy recently who you might consider hiring for your team. Here’s his bio:


Hey folks!
I'm Vadym, and I have a solid background in digital marketing, specifically in media buying and affiliate management.

Here’s a quick look at my experience:

Media Buyer (Native Traffic): I’ve worked with native traffic for e-commerce and nutra products in Tier 3 countries like Indonesia, India, Mexico, and Vietnam. I managed ad spends of $20,000 per month across platforms like Advertnative, Nativeclick, Adnow, and Adskeeper. My role involved creating, optimizing, and analyzing campaigns to improve performance and maximize conversions.

Affiliate Manager: As an Affiliate Manager I built and managed strategic partnerships. I grew a portfolio generating $250,000 to $300,000 in monthly revenue. My focus was on optimizing campaigns and exploring new opportunities to drive profitability.

Solo Media Buyer (Sweepstakes via Facebook Ads): I have hands-on experience running sweepstakes campaigns on Facebook Ads, specializing in lead generation. I’ve mastered creating high-converting campaigns and localizing content for different markets to consistently drive high-quality leads and optimize conversions.

Having gained significant experience in affiliate marketing, I’m eager to apply my skills in digital marketing, conversion optimization, and campaign management to succeed in the e-commerce space.

I'm looking to join a professional e-commerce team, so if you think my skills align with your needs, feel free to DM me. I’m also open to connecting with entrepreneurs just starting in e-commerce—I’m sure we could exchange valuable insights. Currently based in Fort Myers, USA, and would love to meet up with people in the area!

Here’s how to reach me:

[6.06.25, 0:37:20] ~ L: Guys we’re noticing a lot of people going into the Privacy policy page, do you have any idea on why this happens?
[6.06.25, 0:37:33] ~ L: we can’t figure out what they’re looking for😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[6.06.25, 0:53:51] ~ Guy Edan: If you script a VSL based on a VSL you saw and thought was good, do you send your editor that VSL so he does a similar editing style, or let his creativity take him where he thinks makes sense?
[6.06.25, 1:15:00] ~ Jeremy: I usually send the video as guidance but allow them to get creative
[6.06.25, 7:23:53] ~ Mikael: anyone using Shopify email? Ive used klaviyo Before but now im just testing shopify email for a new store. the abandoned checkout and cart emails are not sending out. anyone know?
[6.06.25, 8:03:29] ~ seth: for email not send you can check your trigger, if trigger correct then maybe something missing with your email provider, I think need to setup some thing for your email to be allow to send mkt email.
[6.06.25, 9:23:18] ~ Mikael: I tried checking this but cant find anything weird
[6.06.25, 10:40:21] ~ Mo: im using clickup with my video editor for task management ( is there a way to track what he’s doing) ? i hired him full time but i think he’s working with other clients ( still waiting for clickup CS to get back to me … )
[6.06.25, 10:48:40] Marek Olszewski: you can use time trackers etc, but in my experience assign him deliverables, I think avg is 10 min edited footage/week, so that’s roughly 2 min/day, and get him to send you eod report (briefly what he finished, what he’s working on and what roadblocks does he have)

another thing to pay attention to is predictability of work: feedback loops and delivery at consistent times so the work is not chaotic

if he does not deliver and does not send reports, let go and test another one quickly (give 1-2 chances max)
[6.06.25, 10:56:01] ~ Mo: he’s my first hiring full time, so i admit its a bit chaotic ( no clear SOPs..) , the thing is i dont know how much time the task would take , VSL of 2-3min, any rough estimate ?
[6.06.25, 11:00:43] Marek Olszewski: that would be more or less 1 working day
[6.06.25, 11:06:46] ~ Mo: got it thanks for ur feedback bro
‎[6.06.25, 12:31:30] ~ Steph: ‎image omitted
[6.06.25, 16:18:20] ~ Guy Edan: Do you guys delete bad comments or hide them?
[6.06.25, 16:20:29] ~ Daniel: Hide, deleting massages messes with the algorithm in a negative way ‎<This message was edited>
[6.06.25, 16:20:55] ~ L: Even hiding ?
[6.06.25, 16:21:05] ~ Reece Mander: Actually seems to boost my performance.
[6.06.25, 16:21:30] ~ Guy Edan: To delete or hide?
[6.06.25, 16:35:58] ~ Reece Mander: Either or. Just as long as I remove the idiots
[6.06.25, 16:58:22] ~ Guy Edan: Does anyone else find that nice looking and aesthetic ads dont work for them and the ugly ones do? Or am I just not creating good enough aesthetic ads
[6.06.25, 16:58:56] ~ Filip: Yes always🤣
[6.06.25, 17:04:23] ~ Austin: Bro my ugly ass home made looking ads by far win and it actually pisses me off that my brands perceived that way, but at the end of the day ROAS makes the decisions
[6.06.25, 17:04:48] ~ Guy Edan: Exactly. I see big successful brands with beautiful looking ads, I’ll try to do something similar and it’s a complete flop. Then I’ll do ad that is almost text on a white background and it works lol
[6.06.25, 17:04:58] ~ Guy Edan: I wonder why that happens
[6.06.25, 17:05:39] ~ L: Guys, one question that may sound stupid.

How many ad concepts do you test per week?

We’re trying to scale, but it feels like we can’t even go past $1k/day. Looking back over the past 3 weeks, it seems like we haven’t been properly testing new ad concepts.

Yes, we are testing ads, but it seems like we’re just reusing the same VSLs with different hooks and a few clip changes.

Has anyone else noticed that testing a wide variety of concepts — within the two main formats (video and image) — is actually the key to scaling?

We’re struggling to figure out where to focus our efforts
[6.06.25, 17:05:52] ~ Filip: At the end of day just look at competitors and their longest running ads, copy the style and most likely thats whats gonna work the best. You can try add a couple of “good” looking aesthetic ones but most times they wont do as good
[6.06.25, 17:06:46] ~ Reece Mander: Yep the shit I make with chat gpt that gets half cut off gives me the best ROAS 🤷‍♀️
[6.06.25, 17:07:21] ~ Austin: By far my best ad right now is a white back ground with a back text and a basic product image shot....maybe the algorithm can better identify what's going on and serve it to the best people? Or maybe it only goes after those most aware customers who are ready to buy at any moment?
[6.06.25, 17:09:09] ~ Luka: At 1k/day it's not a matter of having multiple concepts. Technically, any of those concepts alone (image, vsl, ugc etc) should be able to scale past $1k/day. 

Look at your data to properly analyze & figure out where the problem is. If the hook rate is good, video is good - then move to the next step: Your advertorial/LP. Analyze that and so forth. Figure out where the problem is first and then focus on solving that. 

For ex. if you have a lot of visitors but a low conversion rate, then it's likely your advertorial/LP (although the video ad does play a role too, as it's part of the customer journey) ‎<This message was edited>

[6.06.25, 17:29:35] ~ Dan: Hey Guys, I have my Funnelish funnel all set up, got a few orders through so far and then they automatically import into shopify (so they can be shipped out)

… but for some strange reason, the shopify shipping rules don’t kick in, so the customer isn’t charged any shipping fee and my fulfilment house doesn’t know which shipping service to use (as it’s just blank) 

Can anyone help at all or know what the issue is?

All of my “shopify only” orders come through absolutely fine
[6.06.25, 17:38:45] ~ Tom: Hey Dan! I have a default shipping line with my supplier that is being used for any funnelish orders. We also offer express shipping which is shown as extra item and thats how my supplier knows to use faster shipping line. With funnelish, you are only importing orders so shopify wont apply any shipping rules. (If i understood you correctly)
[6.06.25, 17:48:21] ~ Guy Edan: I’m 99% sure u need to set up the shipping within funnelish. Funnelish will override your Shopify pricing and settings
[6.06.25, 17:48:43] ~ Guy Edan: So I believe u need to add the shipping cost within funnelish
[6.06.25, 18:01:40] ~ Dan: Oh ok, thanks guys… I contacted Funnelish and they said it was a shopify issue 🤷‍♂️ and that shopify should apply shipping rules onto the orders, is that not correct then? 

What’s the best way to set shipping rules in Funnelish? I need to charge for cheaper items and set free shipping for bundled items? 

Thanks 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[6.06.25, 19:52:39] ~ Jacob: Hey everyone,
Airwallex suddenly froze the funds in my account without any prior notice or explanation.
I can still receive payments and process transactions, but I can’t move the existing funds out.

Their reply was cold and vague – simply saying they “can’t share details due to regulatory reasons.”

If anyone here:

knows someone inside,

is a professional who can help,
or

has gone through something similar and can share what they wrote to get it resolved —
I’d really appreciate your help 🙏


Feel free to DM me.
Thanks in advance!
[6.06.25, 19:53:40] ~ Jeremy: I also had this experience many times 🤣
[6.06.25, 20:12:40] ~ Y: Send me more details about your current products setup, will have a look
[6.06.25, 20:15:34] ~ Jacob: Guys, which documents the processors usually ask u when things like that happen? Orders, etc...
[6.06.25, 20:45:53] ~ Alessandro: I had the same experience.
I got my funds back after 8 months…
[6.06.25, 20:55:27] ~ Mikael: Did your acc get terminated? Before you got funds back. Or only suspended?
[6.06.25, 20:55:51] ~ Alessandro: Terminated bro
[6.06.25, 20:56:44] ~ Mikael: We just got termination email today. Still no funds back. What did you do in order to get it back?
[6.06.25, 20:57:30] ~ Alessandro: Just waiting them awful customer support service
[6.06.25, 20:58:03] ~ Mikael: So they will contact you after termination or you need to spam em?
[6.06.25, 20:58:21] ~ Alessandro: They must reach you back
[6.06.25, 20:59:26] ~ Jacob: only when you spam them they answer
[6.06.25, 21:00:00] ~ Jacob: and did you make a complaint through the regulator?
[6.06.25, 21:00:05] ~ Mikael: We were in contact with them before couple of weeks ago but did not come any where. But now a few weeks after we got termination email..
[6.06.25, 21:05:42] Malachi: Hey guys, what would you say a good hook rate percentage is on video ads? What is the goal to aim for?
[6.06.25, 21:57:34] Alex  Fedotoff: Our kpi on a team is 20-30 min of footage per week so I would probably ramp up the expectations
[6.06.25, 22:36:29] ~ JULIUS: Nah bro I have friends doing over 15-20k/day in french market (1 product), it's not the market issue
[7.06.25, 1:53:30] ~ david iturbide: Hello I'm new here. I just have a question. Right now I'm testing a 15 min VSL straight to pdp. Ive had meta tracking me 450 link clicks and shopify only tracking 120 sessions. Anyone has any idea of why this could be? My hook rate is 70 per cent so I believe It could be too broad, hold rate is 0.2 per cent, vídeo average play time 40s. This IS quite low right? Yet 3 ROAS so not so bad. Is there anyway to know when on average people click on your link? I believe there could be an issue on people clicking too early, before seeing the product (introduced halfway) seeing a direct response pdp, quickly going out because they expected something else. Could this be the case, if people go too early shopify doesnt count the session? If so, advertorial IS the right move. Thanks 👌🏼
[7.06.25, 1:53:54] Topi: 40s average playtime is very good, no wonder 3 roas.

Is this EU or US?

If EU, it might be cookie problem why shopify is not able to track. Meaning missing cookie banner or people are clicking “no”
[7.06.25, 1:56:36] ~ david iturbide: EU. Ohh, yes that makes sense, thanks!
[7.06.25, 4:09:12] ~ Mo: same happened to me, still waiting to get my funds back, but was just for payments processing on my website, still using the bank acct to receive payouts tho. they didnt bother to explain why ( but for me the reason was i changed domain & forgot to update it in airwallex ) ‎<This message was edited>

[7.06.25, 6:30:21] ~ Mo: guys who work with media buying agencies, do they work/check ad acct weekends ? ( just in case there is an overspend or for whatever reason we never know)
[7.06.25, 10:30:15] ~ Umiddin: Most of agencies dont do a sh*t. 
This why u need to have access and check everything urself or have some one who know and check few times a week. 
When u run ads myself i have Consistent ROAS 4-8+, but when i use agencies im almost always breakeven
[7.06.25, 11:08:28] ~ Mo: Got you, i used to run ads myself & i scale during weekends so not sure now
[7.06.25, 11:46:48] ~ Jeremy: Depends on the agency but I would say most don't check the ads on weekends. Used to run an ad agency myself.

Whats “practically” your testing process for meta, and how u find winners when testing this much of creatives ? . I need to make a clear and efficient system for testing creatives. ( would love also to know  if anyone’s here working with agency and how to push them to test more and test fast). appreciate the help guys 🙌 ‎<This message was edited>
[9.06.25, 5:09:49] ~ Slav: Hey guys
I hope you are all doing well 

I need some help, I’m looking for the agency that would help me to create a bunch of ai videos for tiktok.

The idea is to create videos that would relate to the product that I want to sell and of course there will be a product attached to the videos from Tiktok Shop.

Does anyone know someone who could help me with it?

Thanks!
[9.06.25, 5:32:29] Matán Intsuper: Why not an Upwork freelancer?
[9.06.25, 5:52:45] ~ Slav: Hate freelancers, so unreliable people)

Prefer working with teams/agencies)

[9.06.25, 9:44:08] ~ Mo: guys with HK company/bank acct & selling in EU, i pay a lot of fees with this set up just for conversions ( EUR to HKD, then HKD to EU) what would u guys recommend, how u get around this ?
[9.06.25, 9:59:30] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I just use airwallex, receiving EUR there
[9.06.25, 9:59:43] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Fees are not that high
[9.06.25, 10:35:57] ~ P: What management software do you recommend for all your store accounting if you use Funnelish?

Triple Whale?
[9.06.25, 10:51:52] ~ Cocow😈: It’s more likely you are asking a agenciy to block ressources full time for you with this volume. 

50 unique creatives or including hooks and iterations ? 

This will take you a lot of time to create your team but in the coming year this is going to be the biggest leverage on your business 

So , I would more do in house creative and video editing team if you really want volume testing
[9.06.25, 10:56:18] ~ Mo: Including hooks & iterations. Yes exactly bro, i also have video editors in house to keep pushing creatives, producing content is not the bottleneck for me now, pushing the agency to keep up with this pace is the problem. Because in the end if i have tons of creatives & then the agency is slow to test them out it makes no sense.
[9.06.25, 14:11:39] ~ Marko: ‎This message was deleted.
[9.06.25, 14:15:17] ~ Marko: Curious if the agency is making good creatives. If your editor is outperforming them or equally performing, I’d consider firing the agency and just hiring a media buyer
[9.06.25, 14:18:17] ~ Marko: Another option if you want to try keep the agency is be radically honest with them. Tell them you’re not happy with them and be very precise in what you expect from them (e.g. amounts of ads tested per weel). If they dont agree/fuck up you fire them
[9.06.25, 16:19:04] ~ Cocow😈: Oh I get it. Yes so to be honest we tried as well but agency cost a lot , and the results were not that good. We wanted them to create different ads and concepts but the price was not worth it. I will prefer having 2/3 editors for the price haha

What do you pay someone like this from phililopienes?

[12.06.25, 3:23:49] ~ Mo: Guys anyone tried Bestfullfil ad accounts and switched to Jeremy Khattar’s ad accounts and saw an improvement ( or vice versa )
[12.06.25, 6:08:12] ~ Austin: Just got that update as well. When fb suggests something I typically ignore it.
[12.06.25, 10:28:36] ~ P: Which custom audiences do you use for retargeting on Facebook? I'm doing video views, but I have to select all the videos manually, which is crazy. Is there a way to select all the videos directly?

[12.06.25, 18:10:36] ~ Ziga: Anyone had this before?
[12.06.25, 18:30:12] ~ Mikael: Is this on a klarna merchant or shopify payments?
[12.06.25, 18:30:42] ~ Ziga: Stripe

[12.06.25, 20:15:38] ~ 👀: No experience with klarna Stripe, but have experience with klarna itself.
[12.06.25, 20:17:41] ~ 👀: selling with klarna is possible depending on your products/delivery times. I was selling fashion at the time. Dropshipping from China. Then klarna is asking for trouble.
[12.06.25, 20:17:44] ~ Mike Ramsey: Seen this several times with clients on both Stripe and Klarna direct.  Need to send in what they request and a remediation plan or risk account shutdown.
[12.06.25, 20:20:52] ~ 👀: Yes. It happening all the time. Not only with Stripe but also with direct klarna merchands / Some countrys have klarna via shopify payments. All the time in Some point it shut down
[12.06.25, 20:43:33] ~ Austin: Can someone send me a solid philo video editor? I will probably hire them today / tomorrow. Please DM.

[12.06.25, 23:35:44] ~ Mikael: Anyone know a good UK business address provider?  Which is not flagged
[13.06.25, 1:13:26] ~ Mike Ramsey: Yeah - Klarna is tightening risk / compliance reviews more heavily - which is due to 99 million in net losses in Q1 this year which is a 100% increase from last year.  So we are seeing downstream effects to merchants in underwriting of their business along with consumers who use Klarna to purchase.
[13.06.25, 5:33:05] Fabian: Did anyone ever run CPC campaigns on PR sites?

[13.06.25, 9:42:36] ~ Mo: in my exp Germany, austria, Scandinavian countries
[13.06.25, 9:43:37] Topi: Yes pretty much spot on.

At least germany / scandinavia there’s no really effective alternative
[13.06.25, 10:35:07] ~ Mike Ramsey: Or PayPal - if you’re trying to run aggressive ads / funnels you gotta be careful and keep refund rates <4%

[14.06.25, 9:35:14] Marek Olszewski: Anyone can recommend a reliable US 3PL? I’m looking for good back-end and customer support integrations

[14.06.25, 16:49:47] Shayan: Hey everyone! We (Zendrop) and AdRevival are throwing an exclusive ecom only event in collaboration with Affiliate Takeover in BCN on July 8th to kick off all the networking.

[15.06.25, 10:59:05] ~ Erik Pecovnik: we went from ROAS 4 to 1.5 over night and its like this for almost 4 days now
[15.06.25, 14:09:27] ~ Alessandro: You are not alone 😂
[15.06.25, 17:54:17] ~ Yusuf: Hey guys, whenever we adjust budget or bid of campaigns, they go back to learning again and it's impacting the performance of our ads a lot recently

Are you facing the same issue or anyone knows how to avoid learning?

It happens with even very small changes to budget and bid
[15.06.25, 20:11:09] Matán Intsuper: Opposite here
[15.06.25, 20:11:48] Malachi: Opposite as well. Performance been crazy this weekend
[16.06.25, 3:34:31] ~ L: same here 😅

Hope it doesn’t fall tomorrow or during the week
[16.06.25, 3:34:50] ~ Mo: what u guys think of running simultaneously 2 ad accts to the same lander/pdp ( either meta, tiktok or snap) would that be a problem, like getting the ad acct shut down or making perf drop…?
[16.06.25, 4:15:22] Malachi: Lowkey had me scared lol
[16.06.25, 4:15:41] Malachi: Why would you do this?
[16.06.25, 4:35:37] Matán Intsuper: I did that. It’s not against policy but it does raise ur costs
[16.06.25, 4:38:27] ~ L: were you able to find a workaround that mitigates the problem?
[16.06.25, 4:38:48] Matán Intsuper: Yes, run different products and not same one

[16.06.25, 12:00:25] ~ David B: Hey everyone. Hope all the dads had a great day yesterday. 

The copy call  is on tomorrow. We're going DEEP into the psychological principle of the *Belief Gap*

The Belief Gap.

Is the psychological distance between where your prospect's mind sits today and where it needs to be for them to confidently hit "buy."

If you don't close the gap, you don't sell anything.

This might be one of the most important coaching calls you get all year so make sure you're there!

See you tomorrow.
[16.06.25, 12:33:49] ~ Jeb: @⁨~Mo⁩ at least run them to a lander with different url to keep attribution different. Most brands do multiple ad accounts when scaling big to de risk themselves.
[16.06.25, 12:49:08] ~ Mo: got it makes sense , thanks mate !
[16.06.25, 12:50:21] ~ Mo: anyone know where is the “definining persona & customer avatar” module in the course, i once saw a document that goes into details about this, but checked now & couldnt find it.

[16.06.25, 21:35:02] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Guys for Creative testing, how quickly can we take decisions on the new video creative and baed on what? I read somewhere that after 1000 impressions if the Link CTR is below 1.2 we should turn it off and test another one. Does that make sense?
[16.06.25, 21:39:05] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey I can support. I’ll message you
[16.06.25, 22:11:22] ~ Jacob: Guys anyone have expruence witj pingping global as a bank? (Without their paynent procesing?)
[16.06.25, 23:27:13] ~ Jeremy: I personally let each ad spend around 1.5x - 2x the average CPA before making a decision. Others make decisions faster, but this works for me. ‎<This message was edited>
[17.06.25, 0:10:35] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Thanks so much the answer, and what metrics are you looking for after spending 2X? So lets say you breakeven after 2X CPA do you still run it or it has to be profitable after the initial 2X ?
[17.06.25, 0:15:41] ~ Guy Edan: Personally I learned here and tested it that what works, will work immediately and a bad ad will not turn into a good ad. Meaning, when I launch an ad and it spent even $10-$15 and has bad metrics (low CTR and/or high CPC for example), I will turn it off. I will not wait for it to hit breakeven CPA or something
[17.06.25, 0:16:40] ~ Guy Edan: If however the metrics are good, I let it run
[17.06.25, 0:21:52] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Makes total sense the ad will get worse and not better most of the times
[17.06.25, 0:26:25] ~ .: Guys who run multiple markets, do you run in same campaign (assuming same language) or each country has their own?
[17.06.25, 0:29:00] ~ Allan L: Cpm normally drops a bit and ctr increases once you build social proof on the post. 
I dont test much, like 10-20 creatives monthly on a 1k adspend Daily. 
But I let all creatives spend minimum 100€ (average cpa is 10€) before making a decision. I also add some comments and likes from my own real fb accs from the same country that I target to build social proof faster. (No sheep wants to be the first)
[17.06.25, 1:55:58] Malachi: so you are spending 10x your average CPA before deciding to kill an ad or not? Also, love the idea of adding in some social proof on your own ads
[17.06.25, 1:57:55] Malachi: Also question for you guys. When you are scaling by duplicating winning ads, how long do you let those run before making a decision? I have heard that you should be faster when killing these, but at what point do you kill them?
[17.06.25, 3:45:12] ~ Mo: i opened my bank with them and got restricted after couple of days have no idea why
[17.06.25, 3:48:09] ~ .: Ever tried opening a wise business account?

[17.06.25, 13:40:00] ~ David B: Hey guys! The copy call is on today at 10am est - 3pm UK time. 

We are doing a DEEP dive into belief shifting.

Before anyone buys anything, they have to believe a real solution exists and that your product can deliver it.

I'll show you exactly how today!
[17.06.25, 15:59:43] ~ L: Guys is still Minea the best Ad Spy tool in your opinion?

Are you using anything else to find VSLs?
[17.06.25, 16:12:22] ~ Jeremy: In my oppinion, the easiest ways to find VSLs that work on meta is to use GetHookd
[17.06.25, 16:13:51] ~ Jeremy: I still keep the 1.5x - 2x CPA rule but due to the higher budget, it will get there faster.
[17.06.25, 16:13:59] Topi: Yes just gethookd, filter by minutes, super easy
[17.06.25, 16:54:53] ~ David B: Hey guys, copy call goes live in 5 minutes. See you there.
[17.06.25, 16:57:25] ~ David B: https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BIh2d3fMT8upuW35q_8fxQ
[17.06.25, 17:12:05] ~ Jeremy: Did anyone in here spend a significant amount on threads? If so, how did results compare to FB/ IG placements?
[17.06.25, 18:06:09] ~ David B: Hey all! Thanks for an excellent turnout on the call today. Here is the presentation as promised. 

> https://www.canva.com/design/DAGqgdEgm84/RgWWt-huySW0_i-_4O9Fyw/edit
[17.06.25, 18:10:23] ~ David B: In summary if people don't believe, they wont buy. 

Help them through the belief stage:

1. The problem is real, urgent, and relevant. 
2. There is a solution that is better, faster, and more effective than anything they have tried and considered trying. 
3. Your product is the best way for them to get that solution and all the alternatives are inferior. 

If people believe this, they will buy from you. ‎<This message was edited>

[17.06.25, 21:35:39] Matán Intsuper: We have 500 orders like that
[17.06.25, 21:35:52] Matán Intsuper: And need to sync manually. Support doesn’t help.
[17.06.25, 21:37:22] Matán Intsuper: @⁨~Y⁩
[17.06.25, 21:45:13] ~ Rui Bessa: We have a similar problem with Funnelish not syncing address to paypal, which is giving us a lot of lost disputes Support still coudlnt solve it. We also faced an issue not sending the entire adress line to shopiffy but we could fixed the problem by duplicating the funnel
[17.06.25, 21:45:50] Matán Intsuper: Just duplicating without changing anything ? It happens on our winner funnels now
[17.06.25, 21:46:22] Matán Intsuper: We’d need to change the URL though
[17.06.25, 21:46:28] Matán Intsuper: And lose all stats
[17.06.25, 21:47:17] ~ Rui Bessa: yes…it was what the support said..apparently a bug…you have to maintain the URL so dont lose your post ID on the ads..the stats will go away yeah
[17.06.25, 21:47:38] Matán Intsuper: So you duplicate, and put back the original URL ?
[17.06.25, 21:48:21] ~ Rui Bessa: yes, but first change the original URL otherwise it wont accept . so you have to “shut” the funnel during that operation
[17.06.25, 21:48:41] Matán Intsuper: Well yes but just for a second
[17.06.25, 21:48:48] ~ Rui Bessa: yes
[17.06.25, 21:49:28] ~ Rui Bessa: for us it worked….the adress was being sent but not the right fields..not sure if its happening the same with you
[17.06.25, 23:10:58] Topi: Anyone doing direct mail campaigns successfully?

Would love to ask few questions
[17.06.25, 23:24:52] ~ Ziga: Anyone have any good tutorial on how to setup bundle offers in Funnelish? Two different products that get synced to shopify (as separate orders)…
[18.06.25, 3:17:32] ~ Damjan Topalovic: My man @⁨~David B⁩ crushed it today. Check it out guys
[18.06.25, 4:13:47] ~ Steph: How's Google performing for you all? A reminder, if you are NOT on Google Ads, we still have a bunch of ad credits to distribute. DM if you have NOT had your domain on Google Ads before and I can share more info.

[18.06.25, 9:42:12] ~ Jeremy: When does it makes sense to rent or buy an agency ad account? What are the pros and cons in your experience?

We're running ads from our own ad account and never had any issues with it so far. ‎<This message was edited>
[18.06.25, 9:48:43] ~ Allan L: Yes. But i do ofcause understand my market to full and dont test tons of creatives. 
But 1000-2000€ adspend isnt going to rock the profits , but making sure it keeps running with new creatives. My becpa would be roughly 35€, so i do around 3x breakeven. When i test new products, I do 2x breakeven Per test unless the cpc is 2x the estimate
[18.06.25, 14:23:45] ~ Malik: Hey guys, what's your process when launching new creatives ? Personnally I've been launching all my new batches of ads once per week (every monday dozens of new/iterations creatives). How do you do on your side ?
[18.06.25, 14:43:35] ~ Jeremy: I launch new ads everyday at midnight. Launching weekly is fine too I guess but I prefer to stay a bit more agile. Meaning that if I find a new superstar ad, I don't need to wait that long before I can launch new iterations of it. I feel this shortens the feedback/iteration loop a bit. Hope that makes sense.
[18.06.25, 14:58:31] ~ L: Guys do you have a contact to buy facebook pages reviews?
[18.06.25, 15:11:24] ~ Ziga: Is funnelish down for anyone else?

[18.06.25, 15:12:35] ~ Ziga: My backend Works, but not the landers
[18.06.25, 15:13:01] ~ Ziga: Hi,
While we work hard to keep things running smoothly, this particular issue was caused by a major global outage from Cloudflare, one of the world’s largest internet infrastructure providers. As a result, many platforms—not just Funnelish—were affected this morning.
Rest assured our team does everything that it's in our power to solve asap. You can also monitor the status here: https://status.funnelish.com/

[19.06.25, 3:09:57] ~ L: Guys what percentage of swiped VSLs script do you find to be winning ads at the end ?

I’ve been swiping almost 15 VSLs script in the past 10 days and none of them really spiked 

Is there any criteria you have to choose what VSL script to swipe in relation to your product/market? ‎<This message was edited>
[19.06.25, 3:12:00] ~ Guy Edan: Interested about this as well
[19.06.25, 8:08:07] Malachi: does anyone have deep knowledge of funnelish? I have a few different bundle offers, with different variants. I essentially want customers to be able to choose 2 of the same product, but be able to choose different colors/sizes for each. Can’t seem to find many resources online
[19.06.25, 8:08:46] Malachi: I need to be able to link all of this to my variants on shopify, so that when orders come through, the correct size and color for EACH are reflected
[19.06.25, 8:16:01] ~ Jacob: You cannot do that in funnelish
[19.06.25, 8:16:18] ~ Jacob: You can do it on koala bundle in shopify
[19.06.25, 8:17:48] Malachi: I have seen another store that does it though. Check this checkout out. https://offer.groundedfootwear.co/freedom/en/us/v1/checkout?uid=81&oid=60&affid=23&oidab=570&affidab=96
[19.06.25, 8:17:53] Malachi: I assume this is on funnelish at least
[19.06.25, 8:18:34] ~ Jacob: Its not funnelish
[19.06.25, 8:18:45] ~ Jacob: Its not possible
[19.06.25, 8:18:51] ~ Jacob: I tried a lot
[19.06.25, 8:19:21] Malachi: damn, where was the hold up? Was it setting it up or was it connecting the variants to shopify
[19.06.25, 8:20:24] ~ Jacob: The hold up is to choose 2 different variants in one of the bundle options
[19.06.25, 8:20:30] ~ Jacob: You can only do the same
[19.06.25, 8:21:21] Malachi: can’t believe there isn’t a way to do that. crazy. Thanks for responding though
[19.06.25, 8:21:30] Malachi: if anyone knows any work arounds pls lmk
[19.06.25, 8:21:37] Malachi: i may play with it a little longer just cuz
[19.06.25, 8:21:44] ~ Jacob: Yeah me to
[19.06.25, 8:21:54] ~ Jacob: Its better if u build in gempages
[19.06.25, 8:21:57] ~ Jacob: And also
‎[19.06.25, 8:23:22] ~ Jacob: ‎audio omitted
[19.06.25, 8:25:39] Malachi: so essentially send the traffic from funnelish presales page and sales page, to koala bundle and from there you can go to checkout. Can you customize gempages as much for the OTO’s though?

Anyone has a reference or SOP for checkout optimisation for Shopify plus?
[19.06.25, 11:03:39] ~ Malik: Hi again guys, anyone crushing it with SMS marketing ? Any templates or SOPs  ? I have only one SMS for abandonned carts and it's working like crazy but I think I can improve it more. Thx boys
[19.06.25, 13:30:50] ~ Adam K.: SMS which includes additional discount or just reminder ?
[19.06.25, 15:49:04] ~ P: Hello, can I ask a simple strategy to test a new style of the funnel?  For example, I have 20 new creatives and a new funnel to test. How do you recommend I proceed on Facebook? Should I test all 20 creatives with two different destination links? One for the new funnel and one for the already tested funnel, so that I have 40 active creatives, and then evaluate the results between the two funnels? Because obviously I have to test both the new funnel and the new creatives.
[19.06.25, 15:53:25] ~ ARTURS: PM me, I can share a few templates that are working for us, we run email and sms marketing.
[19.06.25, 15:58:18] Matán Intsuper: Make two campaigns and use Facebook a/b test
[19.06.25, 15:58:28] Matán Intsuper: It will send separate traffic to both campaigns ‎<This message was edited>

Do you use Shopify markets? Do you use page builders? Separate stores?
[20.06.25, 9:12:01] ~ Mikael: hey guys, when yuo run FB Ads, do you run several Products on same ad account and pixel? or only 1 Product per ad account and pixel?
[20.06.25, 9:33:17] ~ Jeremy: Shopify markets
[20.06.25, 9:34:03] ~ Jeremy: Running multiple stores can become expensove quickly as you need to pay for apps multiple times (triple whale etc.)
[20.06.25, 9:35:36] ~ Jeremy: As long as all products are targeting the same avatar I'd use the same account pixel.
[20.06.25, 9:35:38] ~ Mo: For triple whale u can have all brands (stores) under same account and u pay for one
[20.06.25, 9:36:31] ~ Jeremy: Ohh, didn't know that... anyhow, I'd still try to keep everything under one store.
[20.06.25, 10:07:10] ~ Cocow😈: If established brands , I would probably do different stores to segmentate and avoid propagation if ads assets , banks , payment processors 
problems. In SEO perspective I would like as well to avoid disturbing Google but I do not know is this makes sense haha

As well I found it easy to handle the emailing and so on you avoid to do tagging everywhere 

But , it costs more , more work but a bit more safe. 

For a new brand I would probably do shopify markets. You have as well to consider the fact that depending on the volumes of each country it is interesting to have separate stores to reduce transaction fees for example ‎<This message was edited>

We are been launching/testing a lot of beauty products in the same store currently with already 1-2 hero products.

How are you guys managing it with the pixel?

Do you use the same pixel or multiple ones, or maybe even custom events?

What is your strategy?

Would really help us out!
[21.06.25, 21:41:50] Fabian: Guys what is the best way to make an expansion store in Shopify nowadays?
(Duplicating the store into a new language/market on another Shopify account)
[21.06.25, 23:55:54] ~ John B: I think using the same pixel you will be fine if it’s on the same store and niche.
[22.06.25, 4:16:56] ~ Layton Schwenning: Yes. I use it for meta invoicing
[23.06.25, 7:03:55] Malachi: I’ve seen a few people comparing CLAUDE and CHATGPT for writing scripts, hooks, copy etc. Is there a clear winner do you guys think?

[23.06.25, 12:18:44] ~ Jake: Hi guys is there any reason why you would recommend an HK company over an LLC in the US if you are a foreign with ITIN? 

Not talking about taxes.

More in terms of:
-Access to payment processors and rates
-Maybe even legal protection (if it is harder to get sued with HK company compared to US LLC


Cause I noticed that HK has very high processing fees

[23.06.25, 18:18:04] ~ Cocow😈: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[23.06.25, 18:29:12] ~ Mike Ramsey: Depends ultimately what region you are selling to.

If you are selling to the US (>50%), then it makes much more sense to go with a US LLC.  Much broader set of processors and lots of flexibility and overall cheaper, better auth rates, etc.

If you are selling to the EU (>50%) for example, and you are looking for tax advantages, then HK set-up is more logical.  HK payment processors as you mentioned will be much more expensive selling cross border into the EU/ UK however and authorization rates will be much lower.

US processors want you selling to the US primarily.  This is the main disadvantage from an HK set-up.  If you sell almost entirely out of the US with a US based processor, 9/10 times you will get flagged and/or shut down.

In Hong Kong, doesn’t really matter where you sell.  They are more loose from that aspect, but you will pay a lot more for it and it is less stable for payment methods like Klarna as many high risk businesses operate out of HK.

Hope that helps ‎<This message was edited>

How do you train the AI to write good copy?
[23.06.25, 21:16:55] ~ Musawer: Yeah the prompts is so important and also the project that you create (the files inside the project)

But its always about yourself, if it gives you a bad or good copy, and you dont undrestand what is good or bad, it will not work, the judgement is important
[23.06.25, 21:18:15] ~ Musawer: High level people use it not because they dont know copywriting, they using it because they know copywriting and it will write the copy faster
[23.06.25, 21:18:18] Topi: You’d train any AI by giving it resources and examples

Then afterwards checklists for quality assurance

You must write in chunks rather than ask for full production at once 

—

Create yourself a process something like this:

Prompt 1: Resources / high level instructions

Prompt 2: Examples

Prompt 3: Ask it to write XYZ chunk of copy following XYZ guidelines

You: stitch chunks together

You: Quality assurance

You: edit manually / by hand

Would you rather recommend to open up a Paypal business account through that LLC as an foreigner with ITIN (or is this account not likely to be shut down cause they will realize that you are not an US resident when you have other PayPal accounts in other countries)

I’m looking for someone who can build a VSL off of my voiceover .mp3

It looks like all the editor want just to glue the pieces together without doing the hard job 😅
[25.06.25, 15:13:11] ~ David B: It's a bit of both really. 

Good editors should be asking for all of your branded assets to make the VSL more effective and personalized but they should also be sourcing their own b-roll to fill in the rest of the script.

Generally, when I am writing a script, I'll create 2 columns with the script on the left and "suggested footage" on the right. This is to give them guidance on what you expect from them and so they don't have to do all the thinking. 

There are some great creative editors who can read a script and know exactly how to bring it to life but they're not usually cheap. 

Many editors are just good operators with the software and need you to provide all the materials for them.

[25.06.25, 17:09:02] ~ 👀: 100% worth a agency
[25.06.25, 17:10:09] ~ 👀: Google works very well
[25.06.25, 17:10:29] Matán Intsuper: What’s the potential of scale with Google? I haven’t heard of many people doing high numbers
[25.06.25, 17:10:37] ~ 👀: Combination with meta is gold
[25.06.25, 17:11:17] ~ 👀: Bit depends on what you sell / quantity of products. In your store
[25.06.25, 17:11:50] ~ 👀: I would say 30% of what you do with meta but roas is higher
[25.06.25, 17:22:13] Matán Intsuper: Thanks

[25.06.25, 22:29:41] ~ Austin: Are you guys seeing a big difference in performance since the Iran US issue? I’ve had a big session drop since then and ad spend is basically the same. Also heard from my google agency that that happens to clients during the start of Russia and Ukraine war as well. Just wanting to know if that’s correlating to your stores as well?
[25.06.25, 23:07:30] ~ Layton Schwenning: Meta has been bad this week for me. Is it war related? I’m not sure
[25.06.25, 23:38:36] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: I have never seen anyone here talking about Youtube ads, Did any one here mange to actually scale using Youtube ads ? And how does it compare to facebook?
[25.06.25, 23:58:52] ~ Calvin: Lol brother I think your avatar might be the most engaged on that issue, so wouldn't be surprised 

On our side performance hasn't dropped ‎<This message was edited>
[26.06.25, 0:00:36] Matán Intsuper: Depends where ur selling
[26.06.25, 5:18:10] Malachi: is gethookd down for anyone else?
[26.06.25, 5:19:56] ~ Austin: My YT scale is only like $1-2K per day so in comparison to 6-8K on FB it’s not close but for simply launching the same ad in a different platform the time to return ratio is certainly worth it
[26.06.25, 5:20:08] ~ Austin: And some ads that loose on FB win on YT and visa versa
[26.06.25, 5:20:39] ~ Austin: Hit my messages if you need an agency, I’ve got great people
[26.06.25, 5:21:34] ~ Austin: Yes definitely would recommend to run google / YT ads along side meta
[26.06.25, 5:49:02] ~ SM: Hey guys have you noticed that gethookd is down? Server error 500, or is it just me?
[26.06.25, 5:49:12] Malachi: ya I have that too rn

[26.06.25, 5:50:41] Malachi: i feel you, had a bunch of saved ads I was testing and “gone”
[26.06.25, 5:50:47] Malachi: sure it will be up at some point soon though
[26.06.25, 5:50:59] ~ SM: Exactly 😂

[26.06.25, 22:40:16] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Also let me introduce myself.
I'm born in Brazil, raised in Portugal, and I'm digital nomad nowadays.
I do ecom in Europe. Health niche
[26.06.25, 22:41:07] ~ Austin: This guys bank accounts about to explode. ESS material and the coaches will change your life.  Join a lot of calls, ask stupid questions and implement with speed. This group is truly top tier for all levels and very friendly. HMU if you need anything.

[26.06.25, 22:45:24] ~ Reece Mander: Welcome brother!
[26.06.25, 22:58:07] ~ Allan L: HeyGen got this good quality these days?
[26.06.25, 23:02:26] ~ Guy Edan: Question for you guys as a relative newby here - when you spend $5-10k+/day, how many different ads does that spread across usually? (Not including different hooks). Meaning, is it 2-3 winning ads spending thousands a day each, or is it more like 20 ads spending hundreds each?
[26.06.25, 23:10:30] Matán Intsuper: Hundreds of ads daily
[26.06.25, 23:28:49] ~ Calvin: Can do that with 1 good TOF ad
[26.06.25, 23:36:21] ~ Rui Bessa: 1 Good VSL, 10-20 hook and lead variations across different campaigns for me
[26.06.25, 23:39:35] ~ Akshay: I think it’s very use case dependent, it should work for small products that the avatar can hold but the lip syncing still feels off to me on most of the avatars.  Sometimes it works though but takes a while to find the right avatar or train one yourself.
[26.06.25, 23:59:40] ~ Guy Edan: Appreciate your insights @⁨~Rui Bessa⁩ @⁨~Calvin⁩ @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩ 💪🏼
[27.06.25, 0:00:47] ~ Allan L: Okay, thanks.
Yea from what I've seen even without product placement, the avatars just still doesnt feel too natural
[27.06.25, 0:15:30] ~ Guy Edan: Do you guys do 4:5 video ads or 9:16? Up to now I’ve been doing 9:16 but seeing a lot of successful brands do 4:5. Are there important placements I’m missing by not doing 4;5?
[27.06.25, 0:17:14] ~ L: Guys how much are you paying your editor? 

I’m paying 150€ for each 10mins of VSL generated + if their content is a winner (10+ days runnign) I’ll double the price. 

I don’t provide them with anything but the product clips - any brolls has to be sourced by them .

Am I doing too much? Is it too low?
[27.06.25, 0:17:27] Matán Intsuper: I do only 4:5 but I see brands doing 9.16 so going to try it as well.. I guess we just need to try both and see what works better
[27.06.25, 0:18:25] ~ Rui Bessa: 4:5 is most commonly used. If you use 9:16 you will probabily get more impressions on stories than on feed which is the best converting placement usually. If your audience is more tiktoky 9:16 might be ok for shorter videos, but for 40+ audience 4:5 is better in my opinion @⁨~Guy Edan⁩
[27.06.25, 0:19:35] ~ Guy Edan: Yeah my audience is definitely over 40 so will start to do 4:5. Thanks 👌🏼 ‎<This message was edited>
[27.06.25, 0:20:13] ~ Allan L: Seems very very cheap. Atleast if the quality is any good. 
They make the b rolls with AI i assume
[27.06.25, 0:20:38] ~ Allan L: I pay 50€ Per minute and give bonuses if winner.
[27.06.25, 0:22:12] ~ Guy Edan: How much bonus do you give and how do you define a winner?
[27.06.25, 0:25:47] Matán Intsuper: I pay $2500 global full time but I don’t think it’s the best method
[27.06.25, 0:26:04] Matán Intsuper: But I’d probably get Vsls cheaper than 150 euros that way
[27.06.25, 4:29:07] ~ Guy Edan: Is there a way to do a rule of the 3 days + today under roas goal = turn ad set off?
[27.06.25, 4:30:25] ~ Layton Schwenning: i think so. but be careful because facebook over tracks and under tracks so it’s best to use something like triple whale to make decisions on turing things off and on
[27.06.25, 6:00:17] ~ John B: When our brand was spending 10k ish a day it was primarily on 2-3 ads as you mentioned, but not just in one scaling campaign. It was in different interest stacks along with different countries using the same winning ads like you mentioned. We were also spending at least 2k on other ads
[27.06.25, 7:46:52] ~ Akshay: Hey all, Is there anyone here who has experience with starting a supplement brand with unique formulations and getting FDA approvals who I could ask some questions about how it all works and how long it takes?
[27.06.25, 8:21:47] ~ Austin: Yesterday someone had asked about how important google ads are so here's the breakdown of how much google alone brough in last month, with absolutely zero effort on my end. ‎<This message was edited>

[27.06.25, 8:49:36] China Bigboss: Hello bro do you mind I ask one of my team to contact you on private
[27.06.25, 10:09:39] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Hey guys, I am getting a custom from China and the supplier told that we are legally required to mention the country of manufacturing "made in china", do you think this will make the customers sit satisfied with this when they see it ? We did not mention any thing about this on the website though
[27.06.25, 10:14:02] Topi: If you’re ever going to any market place such as amazon, you need this anyway

You might get trough with your listing without it but once they inspect it closer at some point and don’t find country of origin label, you’ll get taken down any way at some point

So if your product is made in china, just have it there. Don’t know how it’s in the states but in europe 80% of stuff in stores are made in china and everyones aware of that, so not a big deal anyways
[27.06.25, 10:15:00] Topi: Once you scale and go from dropshipping and turning your business into real business, product compliance is something to really take seriously. It’s a pain in the ass before you have a system to get it right from the start, but it also opens a lot of doors when done right
[27.06.25, 10:17:19] Topi: Not sure if you need to have this in website, don’t think it’s necessary in most countries or if it is, it’s pretty well hidden

ChatGPT or other AI tools are your best friends navigating through this compliance mess. Just make sure to systemize the research and action items and push it for someone else in your team, if you yourself are not specifically the “Ops guy” of your business
[27.06.25, 10:19:48] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: It is not a dropahipping, we already are ordering the first batch of units into a 3pl.
[27.06.25, 10:20:38] Topi: Thats awesome, now if youre already going trough that effort, get your product compliant with the same effort
[27.06.25, 10:22:21] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Alright this is something I did not think of. I I will check it bro thanks. Do you have an idea how long this compliance process would take ? I am not in the supplement, Beauty or health nich
[27.06.25, 10:24:51] Topi: It depends what you sell, some stuff like health is very regulated and getting the right FDA documents can take up to 6 months and 6 figure investment

I would imagine beauty, kids stuff can be also time consuming

A hack for this is to find good factories who have this all figured out
[27.06.25, 10:24:58] Topi: If in trouble, first consult GPT then lawyer
[27.06.25, 10:55:50] ~ Akshay: Yes of course thank you
[27.06.25, 11:37:05] Fabian: Guys anyone a method to get German mobile phone number?
[27.06.25, 11:38:59] China Bigboss: Does numero have it ?
[27.06.25, 11:39:26] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Krispcall might be the best
[27.06.25, 11:40:24] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: For virtual phone numbers
[27.06.25, 11:40:54] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I think this one is for esim cards right ?
[27.06.25, 12:00:20] China Bigboss: Yes
[27.06.25, 12:05:40] ~ RS: Do you suggest to change ad account or pixel if you see that ads performance have dropped a lot for the last months after over year of running ads from the same ad acc? Cannot Get profitable no matter i Do, no matter how many ads test, campaigns I test, change angles etc.
[27.06.25, 12:08:30] Topi: Sounds very much like feedback score issue if everything died out of nowhere suddenly and nothign works anymore
[27.06.25, 12:10:17] ~ RS: I cannot see my feedback score. It does not show anything more. In ratings and reviews page my rating is 2.5 but based only on 5 reviews. Do you think it can cause that?
[27.06.25, 12:10:31] ~ RS: Also, i still buy feedbacks every week
[27.06.25, 12:13:52] Topi: *supposedly* public page reviews also affects feedback score / the quality of traffic you get and yeah no one can see their feedback scores, at least we don’t

About feedback score, many providers fake their delivery. Heard crazy stories. 

Also try to get your HIVA checked with insider, it’s the internal score facebook gives your assets. Supposedly it affects rejections etc, not sure if on performance. This is all *supposedly* information
[27.06.25, 12:15:49] Topi: In the other hand, there’s often people who blame facebook and assets while their revenue is dipping or business stagnating because of 

1. they’re not testing enough ads
2. ⁠Their ads suck 

And most of the people who struggle or constantly ask in groups “Is meta bad today?”, when you see their ads and offers no wonder nothings stable

[28.06.25, 21:25:03] ~ Mikael: Got 2 accounts frozen and the rest have super bad Hold About 30-40%
[28.06.25, 21:26:05] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Is it common or was it something specific to your situation, maybe you work on a niche they really hate?
[28.06.25, 21:28:14] ~ 👀: No problems with it, but dont use it as payment prosessor. only for banking
[28.06.25, 23:16:04] ~ Adonis A: Any payment processors you guys recommend for funnel ish (based in USA )
[28.06.25, 23:17:11] ~ Mikael: Very common if you use as payment processor as we did. Low revenue and no high risk niche.
[28.06.25, 23:19:15] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: And how did you survive the hold, if you don't mind me asking? High margins?
[28.06.25, 23:24:03] ~ Mikael: Had to change payment method. On some airwallex we got decent reserve and hold. On some we got super bad
[28.06.25, 23:51:00] ~ Jacob: They are shit

[28.06.25, 23:52:43] ~ Jacob: And than they avoid doing that

[29.06.25, 7:52:14] ~ 👀: Yes I have. Sold it in the past. I have a manufacturing in the netherlands
[29.06.25, 8:24:32] Fabian: Dm me
[29.06.25, 8:32:49] China Bigboss: I already texted you bro
[29.06.25, 8:40:33] ~ Viktor Metodiev: @⁨China Bigboss⁩ hooked me up for supplements — they did all the formulations I wanted, certifications and the price was also the best I got
[29.06.25, 8:43:58] China Bigboss: Brother happy always to hear this we build something huge together your guidance on the previous project help us to go to the next level ... Appreciate your words
[29.06.25, 13:32:00] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Is there anyone here who got his business paypal deactivated ? How do you do when you have this problem ? They are saying that the money will be held for 120 days.
[29.06.25, 13:34:04] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: @⁨~Natasha Iris⁩ any hints from your side ?
[29.06.25, 13:49:40] China Bigboss: Tbh nothing to do if the account is new you have to wait and negotiate about the hold ..
[29.06.25, 14:06:55] ~ 👀: Depends on the situation. 
If your products are delivered and you can provide tracking numbers you can talk to them. You do have to have a contact person with an hk account. Is my experience
[29.06.25, 14:07:36] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: It is under a UK LTD
[29.06.25, 14:09:40] ~ 👀: Okay I have no experience with that. I do have experience with a Dutch one. Have the products been delivered? My experience with a Dutch one is 21 days hold. Or a MaX 30% roling reserve. I think Natasha can help you
[29.06.25, 14:10:16] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: No the products were not delivered
[29.06.25, 14:10:53] ~ 👀: Okay and Did they ask info?
[29.06.25, 14:11:04] ~ 👀: Prove of shipping ect?
[29.06.25, 14:12:05] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Not particularly via an email or before the deactivation.
[29.06.25, 14:13:20] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: My products are going to ship in July and it is well mentioned on the website
[29.06.25, 14:15:46] ~ 👀: ah okay, that's probably the reason. They don't look at the website... and maybe it has been unclear to customers which is why you got complaints through Paypal....
[29.06.25, 14:17:26] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I do not think the customers complained about it because literally the price of the product depends on the shipping date so the customers are well informed about it. Probably because of the shipping dates
[29.06.25, 14:21:04] ~ Luka: Do you source supplement manufacturing only from China or also Japan/Korea?
[29.06.25, 14:22:03] ~ 👀: Yes Something triggered the red flag. You need someone within Paypal, my hk paypal was also deactivated once for no valid reason, then set up a company that had a good relationship with Paypal and eventually was able to get it active again. You have a good story by the sound of it everything is correct and well communicated. All you need is someone with contacts within Paypal uk
[29.06.25, 14:22:58] ~ 👀: You do have a chance that they say : your money will be released when you have delivered everything
[29.06.25, 14:28:15] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I talked to customers service and the agent was asking me if I live in the UK (since it is a UK LTD)

I think she found something related to this when looking into the issue. 

I do live in germany though
[29.06.25, 14:44:44] ~ 👀: Aha that could be a reason for their action. I would just wait for reaction from Natasha bro. Do you still have a paypal backup account ?And in what market are you selling? Germany?
[29.06.25, 14:45:51] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Selling in Australia, no backup
[29.06.25, 14:47:29] China Bigboss: Only china for now
[29.06.25, 14:49:54] ~ 👀: Sucks. Then I would pause all ads until you find a solution. Are you operating in other countries as well? Without Paypal?
[29.06.25, 14:50:56] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: The thing is that it's a high ticket product and if people don't pay in installments the CVR rate will drop drastically
[29.06.25, 14:53:01] ~ 👀: Understand
[29.06.25, 14:54:00] ~ 👀: So you need paypal
[29.06.25, 14:56:26] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Right
[29.06.25, 14:58:46] ~ 👀: And you need that deposit to ship your product. So if they don't pay out you're stuck in cash flow
[29.06.25, 15:01:35] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Exactly, and if orders do not ship on time customers will come with their complaints and it is going to be worse
[29.06.25, 15:03:42] ~ 👀: Got it
[29.06.25, 19:05:50] ~ Natasha Iris: Hey! Thanks for tagging me — I’ll respond on Monday with options to navigate this issue and the hold. Talk soon! 🙏🏼 ‎<This message was edited>

[29.06.25, 19:25:46] ~ Guy Edan: Seems like it’s cause we used a few images of celebrities for examples of condition, so they are saying we used a public figure to bait people. Didn’t know that’s not allowed as I’ve seen many brands do similar practices. 

Any ideas what would be the next course of action? Should I create a new account since it’s not only an ad account restriction but the whole account
[29.06.25, 19:34:29] ~ 👀: What kind of set up do you have for meta ads?
[29.06.25, 19:34:57] ~ 👀: At this moment
[29.06.25, 19:36:12] ~ Guy Edan: Have my personal account and our brand is under a business portfolio (I hope that answers the question)
[29.06.25, 19:38:14] ~ Guy Edan: But it looks like all business portfolios and all ad accounts are restricted. Didn’t even know that can happen
[29.06.25, 19:58:55] ~ 👀: Bro

[29.06.25, 20:09:42] ~ Guy Edan: Now the biggest problem is that I can’t even turn off ads which is crazy

In 2 of my adccounts, there’s no option to use “original targeting without ADV+ audience” and at the same time there is no ASC+ anymore. Basically i can only do ABO or CBO both with ADV+ options activated by default and i cant change it
[29.06.25, 20:36:45] ~ Rui Bessa: i tried to duplicate older ASC+ campaigns in this account and basically it transformed them into CBOs

[30.06.25, 17:52:15] ~ Jake: Yes always adding it
[30.06.25, 18:16:18] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Why is that?
[30.06.25, 18:20:56] ~ Jake: Technically you can get a fine for not doing it. But you will probably never get caught.

Some banks and payment processors don’t like it when you don’t have your company on your website. That’s the main reason tbf.

I mean if someone wants to find out your brand they just subscribe to your email newsletter or they can see your company during checkout if you have PayPal active. So there is not really a point of not doing it

I hear different stories.

[1.07.25, 13:56:55] ~ Ali Azhar: Always
[1.07.25, 14:03:19] ~ Jeremy: A CAPI solution
[1.07.25, 14:05:25] ~ Jeremy: We had a lot of changes in the business recently due to several reasons, so it's difficult to isolate Aimerce's effect on ad performance precisely. 

But it helped us improve our event match quality, and navigate the health & wellness pixel restrictions.

I’m about to launch 4 different funnels for 4 separate brands, and I need a team that can keep up with the workload.

How would you manage the team?

Would you have the copywriters collaborate with one another—and the video editors do the same?

[2.07.25, 9:23:00] ~ Cocow😈: Hi team 

We have a brand with main market France that we are launching. To facilitate , our default language is English , and then we used Shopify market to add French language and relevant markets. 

But , it seems that clients are landing in the English version of the Website on PDP… 

We use the setup that every market is linked to the original domain .com 

So basically , for French language there is just the fr that is added on the url like this: https://brand.com/fr

But , seems that some clients see English …

Has anyone faced this issue or any suggestions ? Thanks 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[2.07.25, 15:17:08] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Hi All, I have an annoying customer who is looking for  errors on the website to get refunds or discounts (she was charged an international fee from her bank for her purchase :  14 aud) and she wants to be refunded. What do you do for these customers ? Cancel their order ? 

I am sure she will come with another problem and at the end she will start a chargeback.
[2.07.25, 15:41:52] ~ Natasha Iris: Payments Call Today! 🚀
We’re diving into one of the most requested topics from merchants: funding holds and blocked accounts — looking specifically at how this plays out on both a Tier 1 processor (Airwallex) and a basic PSP (Shopify).

I’ll break down:
• The top 8 reasons why funds get stuck or held in reserve
• ⁠A case study comparing how Tier 1 vs. basic PSPs handle risk
• ⁠And most importantly — what you can actually do about it

If you’ve ever dealt with payout delays, sudden holds, or account shutdowns, you’ll want to be on this one. See you there

[2.07.25, 15:43:46] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Just refund her or cancel her order your time is more valuable than fighting with those customers
[2.07.25, 15:56:17] ~ Jacob: Hi guys do you know a service to get a legit address in USA for opening wise business account? Because the virtual mail box does not work? And also get a utility bill
[2.07.25, 16:08:35] ~ Natasha Iris: @⁨~Ahmed HALKOUM⁩⁩ agree with @⁨~Dr. Amr hamed⁩⁩ — sounds like one of those customers who’ll keep finding reasons to get a refund or file a chargeback

But, I’d also tighten your site language to help prevent issues like this:
- Add a line in your shipping policy or terms of conditions; clearly stating that any international transaction fees are charged by the customer’s bank or card issuer — not by you. These fees (AUD $14) are common in cross-border purchases. Flagging that upfront reduces confusion and gives you ground if it escalates.
	• Also, the $14 is fine to refund, but when we start refunding full procduct $ and you’re selling cross-border with a high AOV, issuing refunds just to avoid friction can start hurting your refund rate. Clarifying your policies supports your case if it turns into a dispute.

I DM’d on a CB tool — definitely something to have in place if you’re not already using one. ‎<This message was edited>
[2.07.25, 19:06:31] ~ Mike Ramsey: wework.com if you need something super quick - just get a private desk.  Around $300 / month depending on city.  Utilities are included on the month to month agreement.  It’s works for all payment processor and bank compliance.  Adyen even approved a client of mine with this as well.

[3.07.25, 11:58:36] ~ Mikael: Anyone running ads with the Blue tick on FB page? any noticable difference?
[3.07.25, 14:39:00] ~ Dorn Edvin: Hey Legends! We're looking for advice on persistent high CPM issues in Europe.
We're running ads in various European countries (Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, etc.) mostly markets with 10–20 million population.
We've been struggling with very high CPMs in all of these countries (25-40$). To try to fix it, we: ✅ Created a new FB page ✅ Set up a new pixel ✅ Started using a new ad account on a different Business Manager
And we are using our own, self-made creatives. (We tried image and video ads also)
Unfortunately, none of these changes made a difference after we spent hundreds of dollars on the tests, our CPMs remain extremely high.
At this point, we're wondering:
Who should we reach out to for help?
A friend suggested trying a domain change do you think that could have any impact on CPMs?
Any advice would be super helpful. Thank you in advance! 💙
[3.07.25, 14:41:45] Topi: Has the CPM always been high or it just one day appeared high?
[3.07.25, 14:42:13] Topi: Is this with 1 product or multiple products?
[3.07.25, 14:44:34] ~ Dorn Edvin: It was high every single day with a 100$ budget
[3.07.25, 14:44:36] ~ Dorn Edvin: Just one product
[3.07.25, 14:45:48] Topi: I mean if you’ve always had super high CPM’s and nothing helps, the first thing that comes in my mind your ads just suck or you are selling some flagged product
[3.07.25, 14:47:14] ~ Dorn Edvin: Yeah but we are making around 3K days in Hungary with this product and we have really good perfoming ads thats why I don't really understand this situation ‎<This message was edited>
[3.07.25, 14:47:58] ~ Dorn Edvin: We translated our winning ads properly in every country
[3.07.25, 16:30:02] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: How much was it before for you. 25-40 is the norm in the US
[3.07.25, 16:32:12] ~ Dorn Edvin: Yes but these are small countries
[3.07.25, 16:32:18] ~ Dorn Edvin: In Hungary we have 5-6$ CPM-s
[3.07.25, 16:34:35] ~ Dorn Edvin: It should be around that in Romania, Slovakia, etc., according to Mercédesz and our friends who have brands in these countries
[3.07.25, 16:35:37] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: I am facing the same issue our CPM here almost 4-6 times higher for the last month. Also tried new BM , Ad account , Page etc nothing works.
[3.07.25, 16:36:46] ~ Dorn Edvin: Hmm interesting
[3.07.25, 16:42:21] Matán Intsuper: Have you tried different domain and landing page
[3.07.25, 16:43:39] Matán Intsuper: And as topi said maybe different ads
[3.07.25, 18:06:53] ~ Dorn Edvin: About to try it
[3.07.25, 18:07:12] ~ Dorn Edvin: Thank you guys😊

What is the one thing you have done to have consistency in your sales ? 

Every week I am hitting maximum and minimum revenues so I want to reach that consistency.
[3.07.25, 19:17:47] Topi: Test enough new creatives each week

[3.07.25, 19:57:52] ~ Austin: ‎This message was deleted.
[3.07.25, 19:58:07] ~ Austin: Hammering down on winning ad revisions has become the biggest lever for success I've found so far, more revenue and better profit across the board
[3.07.25, 19:59:50] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: You mean creating multiple versions of your winning ad ?
[3.07.25, 20:33:28] ~ Austin: Yes, exactly. New hook / script copy. New Hook / script footage. New back ground music. New Caption styles. Floating head vs no floating head. and the options go on and on.
[4.07.25, 0:23:00] ~ 👀: Anyone here tips on how to scale in the German market?

I now have 1 winning cbo campaign at €350 with roas 3+ scaling now with 10-15% every day. 

I also test 10 new variants every day, just curious how you guys would handle this
[4.07.25, 12:59:05] ~ Dorn Edvin: You mean landing page on completely different shopify store or just make a different product page? Or make a funnel?
[4.07.25, 16:17:45] Matán Intsuper: I’d say different landing page (template copy and domain)
[4.07.25, 16:17:53] Matán Intsuper: Just to see how it affects the cpm
[4.07.25, 16:17:57] Matán Intsuper: E.g funnel vs Shopify
[4.07.25, 16:18:04] Matán Intsuper: I saw big cpm differences
[4.07.25, 16:44:25] ~ .: You saw lower cpms on funnelish?
[4.07.25, 18:15:22] ~ .: What’s up guys? Looking to get loads of Ugc content for my brand, what platforms do you suggest and do you recommend pay per video or duration of content

Wanted to ask a few question regarding the way consumers live and buy things there! 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>
[5.07.25, 21:10:01] ~ Henry: What do you mean? Like the links in your CTA?
[5.07.25, 21:10:39] ~ Henry: I use Insense a lot right now and it’s great with product seeding. You pay nothing to creators and get genuine videos. 

Otherwise, Backstage works too
[5.07.25, 21:11:57] ~ 🥇: Yes the links in CTA forward to a different page
[5.07.25, 21:12:14] ~ .: Was contemplating getting the quarterly plan just because of product seeding, thanks man

[6.07.25, 4:23:36] ~ .: Arcads g
[6.07.25, 7:15:04] ~ Austin: Arcads is so incredible
[6.07.25, 7:15:18] Malachi: so it works well then
[6.07.25, 7:15:24] Malachi: 100% worth
[6.07.25, 7:15:44] ~ Austin: Honestly man I turn all of the enhancements off
[6.07.25, 7:15:55] ~ Austin: 10000% arcads is worth it
[6.07.25, 7:16:15] ~ Austin: For me personally it out performs real actors
[6.07.25, 7:16:21] Malachi: damnnnn
[6.07.25, 7:16:29] Malachi: why? Just cuz you can control everything that they do
[6.07.25, 7:16:36] ~ Austin: And wayyyyy cheaper then a $100-200 UGC creator
[6.07.25, 7:17:33] ~ Austin: Personally I myself film B-roll and then use the arcade actors as the spokes person, so we can test scripts and hooks insanely fast and cheap
[6.07.25, 7:17:49] ~ Austin: It’s about $10 per video with the plan I’m on
[6.07.25, 7:18:08] Malachi: thats not bad at all. Is it easy to use/
[6.07.25, 7:18:18] ~ Austin: and if you have editors it’s easy to train them how to generate on it as well
[6.07.25, 7:19:21] ~ Austin: Yeah man very simple. Add the script and you’re good to go. If you really want to dial it in then up some of the settings, but there’s only 4 or 5 settings you can even mess with in the first place
[6.07.25, 7:20:10] ~ Austin: And I get my editors or make floating head variations as well, where it’s just straight B-roll with the actors head over top and that’s typically the best way for us
[6.07.25, 7:20:31] Malachi: thats huge to hear both you guys use it. Ima expirement with it myself, test some ads, and go from there. Mind if I reach out with any questions?
[6.07.25, 7:34:25] ~ Austin: Bro reach out for sure
[6.07.25, 14:39:00] ~ 👀: Anyone in this group who ever does direct payouts at Stripe?

For tomorrow’s payments call, I’ll be covering a 2 part series in partnership with Disputifier specifically around the new Visa Acquiring Monitoring Program (chargeback management program) and how not to get your payment processing account shut down or funds held.

I will also be providing a complimentary guide and checklist around the program and how to prepare as we are only a few months out from the new ‘stricter’ requirements set to roll out in October.

We’ll also cover the new chargeback thresholds/fines that will take place on October 1st and what the new TC40 additions will mean to your dispute ratio.  Very important to know how to manage this when you are scaling in Q4! 📈

See you there 👍

[12.07.25, 18:40:45] ~ Matthew Darrel Wood: Guys I’m running ads to a pretty small market, and wondering if I have a targeting problem, or if the market itself is small.

Last 30 days I have 450k people reached but 1.4m impressions, my frequency seems really high from what I’ve seen from other people.

Could this just be a targeting issue, and should I be worried?
[12.07.25, 18:45:15] ~ Rui Bessa: That could also happen if you’re running bottom of funnel ads , like statics showing the product
[12.07.25, 18:46:21] ~ Matthew Darrel Wood: I run no statics
[12.07.25, 18:48:10] ~ Matthew Darrel Wood: *only USA targeting, fully broad, no special targeting
[12.07.25, 18:48:33] Topi: The total audience that facebook can target is even smaller than the country population itself (obviously)

We used to advertise heavily in 5m total population country, and facebook gave us total audience size of 300k (no targeting, such 100% broad) 

Out of that 300k, maybe 5-10% was realistically our audience, so we’d see frequency +10 all the time
[12.07.25, 19:45:12] ~ 🥇: Hi, we’ve started implementing funnels in Funnelish using Airwallex as our pg. However, we’re seeing a low acceptance rate in the U.S. market.
We’re looking for recommendations on alternative payment gateways that work well in the U.S.  ideally something we can apply for easily and that has high acceptance rates.
For context, we have a good track record with both Airwallex and Shopify Payments. Also, is there any way to integrate or use Shopify Checkout with Funnelish? We'd really appreciate any suggestions. Also If you have any insider for us pg you can connect us with

[12.07.25, 20:10:48] ~ 🥇: I avoid doing it as i think it may affect shopify payment account because sp isnpowered by stripe
[12.07.25, 20:11:15] ~ 🥇: Okay will try to apply for it
[12.07.25, 20:14:36] ~ Jacob: Quick take

Shopify Payments is a Stripe-powered “connected account.”

A suspension that hits any account tied to the same legal owner or KYC details sits in Stripe’s global risk database.

Opening a fresh standalone Stripe login after a ban can trip those same risk flags and can boomerang back to Shopify Payments—but it’s not guaranteed.

Many people successfully run both Shopify Payments and a separate Stripe account in parallel, but only when neither record is on Stripe’s internal blacklist. 



---

How the link really works

What	What it means	Why it matters

Shopify Payments backend	Stripe (or Bridge/PayPal, depending on country) handles processing; merchants sign the Stripe Connected Account Agreement inside the Shopify TOS. 	Stripe keeps full KYC on you (legal name, EIN, SSN/passport, IPs, device fingerprints).
Risk database	Stripe shares network-wide fraud & compliance signals across all of its properties (Radar, Connect, etc.). New merchant-risk tooling blocks “suspicious accounts” based on those signals. 	If you open a new Stripe account with details that match a banned profile, the system generally auto-suspends it and may re-evaluate any connected accounts (including your Shopify Payments profile).
Parallel use	Nothing in the rules stops you from adding “Stripe (direct)” as an additional gateway in Shopify; guides even describe how to run both simultaneously. 	Works fine when you have a clean Stripe history. When you don’t, it’s roulette.



---

So, will a new Stripe login nuke Shopify Payments?

Scenario	Likely outcome

Original Stripe ban was a regulatory or high-risk-product violation (e.g., prohibited items, repeated chargebacks)	Stripe’s blacklist usually flags any new account with overlapping owners. New account gets closed fast; Stripe may inform Shopify to suspend Shopify Payments.
Original ban was a paperwork/KYC mismatch but later cleared	If Stripe fully reinstated you, new accounts usually stay open and Shopify Payments is unaffected.
You create a new Stripe under a different legal entity with unique EIN, address, phone, bank, domain, and cleaned metadata	Much lower correlation risk. Still theoretically traceable (IP, device), but merchants report success.
You reuse the same entity/details	Very high probability of instant shutdown and potential ripple to Shopify Payments.



---

Practical advice for your friend

1. Appeal first – A successful reinstatement on the original Stripe MID is the safest fix.


2. If you must start fresh:

Incorporate a truly separate LLC / LTD with a new EIN and bank account.

Use a clean domain, support email, and device/IP that Stripe hasn’t flagged.

Expect a real underwriting review—send invoices, supplier contracts, ID docs promptly.



3. Have fall-back gateways – Add PayPal, Authorize.net, Braintree, or a high-risk PSP so you’re not 100 % Stripe-dependent while things shake out.


4. Monitor Shopify Payments – If Stripe asks for new docs or pauses payouts, respond inside 48 h; that’s the first sign they linked the records.


5. Document everything – Keep CSV exports of payouts/orders and email threads; if Shopify Payments is frozen you’ll need them for chargeback defense and proof to alternative processors.




---

Bottom line

Your theory that “Shopify doesn’t really know which Stripe merchant we are” is only half-true. Shopify purposely abstracts the relationship, but Stripe still does know—and its risk engine can talk back to Shopify. If the ban was severe, spinning up a new Stripe login with identical credentials is likely to get caught and can endanger Shopify Payments. If it was a minor or resolved issue, or you launch under a clean corporate identity, the two can coexist safely.
[12.07.25, 20:20:00] ~ 🥇: Thank you appreciate it
[13.07.25, 19:14:44] ~ L: Guys do you have someone in the team that’s constantly looking for products to sell?

How have you trained the guy? And how do you pay it?

I’m thinking about hiring someone that can find products scraping tools / ads library - but I’m not really sure how much I should pay the guy - don’t really want to pay by the hour
[13.07.25, 19:16:04] Malachi: Could you pay a base rate (pretty low amount per hour), and then a bonus for each product that is a winner. Or even for every product that you decide to test because it passes your personal inspection
[13.07.25, 19:17:33] ~ L: That’s actually a good idea 

I can also have 2 bonuses - 1st bonus is If I choose the product - 2nd if it turns out to be a winner 

Have you had any experience with this system?
[13.07.25, 19:18:31] Malachi: There ya go, that works. I am kinda in the same spot as you, looking to hire out a product researcher, and this was the idea I had to test, haven’t had a chance to really implement yet though
[13.07.25, 19:18:57] ~ L: The issue is when they work for like 3 hrs and only bring home 2 products
[13.07.25, 19:19:45] Malachi: Yea…. Need to make sure that the base rate is low enough that doesn’t hurt us, and the incentive is high enough that they are motivated to find winners
[13.07.25, 19:19:53] ~ Miika: Quality over quantity for sure
[13.07.25, 19:21:45] ~ John B: Are you talking about for an existing brand or new product tests on a new store.
[13.07.25, 19:22:34] ~ L: New funnels to run
[13.07.25, 19:23:09] ~ L: ofc, but still I want to avoid lazy people that find the small trick to pull out money without deserving it
[13.07.25, 19:23:25] ~ L: And i want to do it paying them for the good job
[13.07.25, 19:56:08] ~ 👀: Last thing I would personally outsource is product research. That's often where your creativity starts and you know how you should sell/market it...I've tried it myself but no one can do this better that you because this is not often about the product but about àlle around it marketing funnel offer deep research who is your customer ect
[13.07.25, 19:58:45] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: 100% agree with you, your product is a story you imagine it so it can become  a brand and no body can have that without your input
[13.07.25, 20:45:02] ~ L: I’m not talking about Market Research - I’m talking about products guys 

The thing you talk about usually happens to me whenever I’m doing market research
[13.07.25, 22:22:39] ~ Carter Mac: anyone know how I can add facebook comments to my funnelish funnel? ‎<This message was edited>
[14.07.25, 1:55:34] ~ F: do you guys have any recommendatino for a really good media buyer?
[14.07.25, 1:56:57] ~ Fadel: Ask support or u can copy the html element and paste it from another funnel

[14.07.25, 4:04:23] ~ Austin: Hey guys what softwares do full automated AI videos? Beyond Arcads?
[14.07.25, 4:16:31] ~ Ashton Morgan: Hey does anyone have any contacts to get FB ads unrestricted? The AI is incorrectly rejecting most of  my ads
[14.07.25, 8:53:02] ~ Mikael: Does google misrep AI generated reviews? Images etc
[14.07.25, 12:19:16] ~ 👀: Question for you Guys, 
For meta ads settings  
If you advertise a advertorial or listicle, do you set the conversion event still on purchase ?
[14.07.25, 12:20:35] ~ 👀: Alex gives a phone number bag here in the chat for this products
[14.07.25, 14:49:42] ~ Vasile: Hey guys, I need to cancel today’s Google call due to travelling. DM me your questions.
[14.07.25, 15:06:59] ~ David B: Hey guys. 

Copy call is on tomorrow. 🥳

I'm going to be discussing unique mechanisms. What they are, what they mean, how to create them and how to use them. 

Then we'll also have a Q and A session for any of your copy questions.
[14.07.25, 17:04:06] Fabian: Hey guys, 

What exact conversion do you use to substitute standard purchases with a custom event (target = lower cpa), when sending data back to Facebook?
I would assume the trigger would a thank you page visit, or is it something else?
[14.07.25, 18:23:06] ~ L: Guys any of you tried Sintra AI?
[15.07.25, 0:07:06] ~ L: Guys is any of you using VEO3 for brolls?
How to you fix the “something went wrong” message?
[15.07.25, 0:19:01] ~ Santiago: just refreshing lol
‎[15.07.25, 0:31:33] ~ Mike Kasdorf: ‎image omitted
[15.07.25, 6:18:24] ~ Steph: Yes, otherwise your competition could come in and overtake this in time to come. Branded campaigns are a small cost for big protection and conversion value. Think of it like paying a low fee to keep your shop window looking better than the one next door.
[15.07.25, 10:10:03] ~ 👀: I am now trying to lead cold customers to an advertorial landing page with and focus on that campaign on landing page views, to make them aware of my offer, then target them with my higher scale cbo campaigns that are geared towards purchases.

Now my question is, does this happen automatically because the pixel uses this data or how what are your thoughts on this?
[15.07.25, 10:23:57] ~ 👀: are you working with agency ad accounts?
[15.07.25, 10:26:06] ~ 👀: are you working with agency ad accounts and facebook structure?
[15.07.25, 10:26:36] ~ 👀: icon, i got this one from jeremy. it works realy good.
[15.07.25, 10:54:05] ~ P: Pm me - i can help
[15.07.25, 13:35:47] ~ Allan L: Anyone have a graphic guy for meta ads?
Looking to get images done for a facebook ad campaign but the first 3 takes on Upwork gave really bad creatives.
[15.07.25, 14:57:02] ~ David B: Hey everyone. 

The Copy Call kicks off today at 10AM EST - 3PM UK time. 

We're talking about unique mechanisms, answering your questions, and I'll share my VERY in depth research process if we have time!
[15.07.25, 16:20:05] ~ Mike Kasdorf: No. It's my own.
[15.07.25, 17:00:20] ~ David B: Copy call is live now.

[16.07.25, 2:16:56] ~ Kevin Krieg: yes
[16.07.25, 11:19:37] ~ L: Guys health niche, Pixel is not tracking sales (but it tracks everything else) 

Have any of you experienced this?
[16.07.25, 11:21:31] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Jep, high chance that you are categorized as health brand by Facebook
[16.07.25, 11:21:54] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Working with custom conversion events is a solution you can try (aimerce is good as far as I know)
[16.07.25, 11:25:43] Carlos Leeseman: Aimerce won't solve the issue, because your domain is likely restricted too, so simply creating custom events won’t fix it. To bypass this, you need to redirect Facebook's event tracking so they can't detect your domain.

We use Bily, which tracks events through their own domain. This lets you keep using your own domain for your store, while events are routed through theirs. It's currently the only CAPI solution we've found that consistently works when both your domain and pixel are restricted.

[17.07.25, 23:44:52] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Hey dudes and dudettes! 

Sorry for all of the group call issues with Serhii and Richie the last couple of weeks. We decided it’s best to keep the calls separate, one with Serhii first at 11AM EST, then one with Richie at 1PM EST every FRIDAY. 

Please check out the registration links in the Skool Calendar to sign up for tomorrow and following weeks. Note that Serhii’s Friday call that was usually about 7 hours earlier is being replaced for this one. Let me know if you have any questions about this.
[17.07.25, 23:49:24] ~ Kamal: Guys anyone got recs for a good US tax / CPA firm? 

I’m dealing with a really incompetent one that’s driving me insane right now.
[17.07.25, 23:52:32] ~ Mike Ramsey: Hey all - this is not a promotion for a vendor, but anytime you can bring masterminds in ecomm together it helps create community and sharpens skills.  I wanted to drop this link for an event in California for anyone who may be able to attend.  

Appears to be free (pending approval and vetting) and no strings attached.

Quick question:
Is it true that once a Meta ad account spends over $500/day, the cost per purchase automatically goes up due to the platform?
Would love to hear your experiences 🙏

[19.07.25, 4:21:19] ~ Luka: Don’t think it works that way, it’s auction-based. Meta wants you to make more money, so you spend more money.

[19.07.25, 4:36:06] ~ valentin📴: It definitely makes a lot of sense to me, thank you very much for the answer and good night to everyone (in Argentina it's already night 😆)
[19.07.25, 5:10:33] ~ Luka: Our new BM/Ad account is stuck at $50/day 5 days in a row. We’ve spent the daily limit every day, and all payments were successful. How long does it typically take now a days?
[19.07.25, 5:12:32] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Verify your business if you can on the ad manager you will immediately get 4-5x this daily limit
[19.07.25, 5:12:47] ~ .: This is true
[19.07.25, 5:14:04] ~ .: What’s the longest anyone has had a creative run for? Have a winner running for a while at high spend with low frequency but roas has been dipping a bit lately

2. ⁠what is your email opt in rate (% of people who enter the site, who give you their email +/ SMS)

I am very very curious
[20.07.25, 20:11:09] ~ Ziga: What's a good review app and bundle app for Shopify?
[21.07.25, 3:32:30] ~ Hunter Davenport: Does anyone have a guy on fiverr they’d recommend for creating some simple email flows?

[21.07.25, 4:16:03] ~ Hunter Davenport: Will do thanks man
[21.07.25, 4:23:56] ~ Austin: What would you do if a copy writer won't perform a test trial? This has happened 4-5 times so far and It seems to be from the more experienced candidates, so I don't want to loose them, but at the same time it indicates their difficult to work with, does anyone have a suggestion here?
[21.07.25, 4:26:42] ~ .: how much are they expecting for a trial task should be the question
[21.07.25, 7:36:34] ~ Akshay: Hi all, does anyone here have a funnelish designer who can work on a gig/part time basis for building about 10 funnels for us including making gifs/graphics?
[21.07.25, 21:42:38] ~ valentin📴: Hey everyone! 👋 Hope you're all having a beautiful and successful day 💫

I'm planning to gradually increase the price of one of my digital products and wanted to ask for your thoughts:

What % price increase would you recommend testing first in order to improve results without hurting conversion too much?

Wishing you all amazing ROAS and flow this week! 🚀💰
Thanks in advance for your wisdom 🙏

Does anyone have experience with AI store builders? If so, which one would you recommend?
Also, I'm looking for an app that allows me to customize the Shopify checkout page without needing Shopify Plus, do you happen to know any?
Thanks a lot in advance! :)
[22.07.25, 12:13:00] ~ JULIUS: Hi Dorn, Shopify checkout is too strict to customize it without being on + plan. You don't really need that to scale it hard 🫡
[22.07.25, 12:14:17] ~ JULIUS: If you really need to customize your checkout for whatever reason you will have to use external checkouts such as Checkify etc but you're at risks with Shopify policies there
[22.07.25, 12:39:58] ~ Dorn Edvin: Thanks a lot Julius!

Been here for a while and not from Warsaw.

But hey, while I am tagged. If anyone starting a new brand or looking for trustpilot profiles with tons of good reviews, let me know. Found a little "glitch", testing if it can be combined with already established brands already. ‎<This message was edited>

[23.07.25, 15:41:47] ~ Natasha Iris: Payments Call Today 🚀
“How I’d Build My Payment Stack From Day 1” 

Running a brand or launching one soon? Today I’m breaking down how I’d build a payments stack if I were starting fresh.

We’ll talk:
• Setting up your PSPs to avoid funding holds
• How to layer risk & redundancy
• What tools I’d install from Day 1
• How to go from Stripe/PayPal ➡️ Tier 1 + global scale

This is especially useful if you’re scaling, high-risk, or selling cross-border.

[23.07.25, 17:06:46] ~ Mikael: Hey, Anyone used Revolut with UK LTD and had problems verifying the cards to Google ads and FB Ads?
[23.07.25, 17:07:26] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Working fine for me with fb ads
[23.07.25, 17:08:22] ~ Mikael: we tried 2 different cards, both were approved at the revolut bank app. but both FB and Google denied or couldnt verify it
[23.07.25, 17:11:20] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Did you tried using them to buy something online ? 

It might be also that the currency on that card is dflifferent from the currency on fb ads or gg ads
[23.07.25, 17:19:48] ~ Mikael: We have both eur and gbp in revolut. This is the currencies we tried to connect. 

One of the cards is connected and fully working with Shopify

[25.07.25, 4:11:55] ~ Guy Edan: Our main brand up to now was aimed towards women but we’re launching a landing page for men - should we use the same pixel or a new one?
[25.07.25, 6:52:03] ~ Layton Schwenning: You can’t add multiple pixes to shopify without shopify plus now
[25.07.25, 6:52:32] ~ Layton Schwenning: so might be difficult to have everyhting linked to one shopify

I’m looking to replace my current editor soon — performance just isn’t where it needs to be. Ideally someone who can handle VSLs (2–10+ mins).

If someone comes to mind, shoot me a DM I would love to connect with them. Appreciate it
[25.07.25, 22:19:05] ~ Alessandro: Hi guys 
Someone noticed that in new stripe account the selfie verification is not more required?

Cause I’ve opened a new stripe account since a week and still don’t ask any verification
[25.07.25, 22:25:06] Matán Intsuper: They will start require stuff when you bring revenue
[25.07.25, 22:25:50] ~ Alessandro: We’ve already made around 8k on it
[25.07.25, 22:26:12] Matán Intsuper: It will come sooner or later, and they will stop payouts until you provide it
[25.07.25, 22:26:21] Matán Intsuper: Prepare mentally :)
[25.07.25, 22:27:11] ~ Alessandro: You mean the selfie verification, right?
Cause in another account we’ve got it after the first 2/3 sales
[25.07.25, 22:27:28] Matán Intsuper: I don’t think I ever got selfie verification and I processed millions
[25.07.25, 22:27:40] Matán Intsuper: But I was in review at least 5 times in the last 2 years
[25.07.25, 22:27:47] Matán Intsuper: They ask for different random stuff
[25.07.25, 22:28:16] ~ Alessandro: Thank you @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩  for your feedback 🙏🏻
[26.07.25, 2:56:27] ~ valentin📴: Hey everyone! 👋
Quick question regarding Meta Ads optimizations — I’d love to hear your experience.

Is there any downside to making changes to an ad within less than 24h of publishing it?
For example, does editing an ad (like changing the creative, copy, or CTA) in less than 24h / 12h / even 6h negatively impact performance or slow down the algorithm’s learning process?

I’ve heard mixed opinions, so I’m wondering:
👉 Does the AI need a full 24h to adapt?
👉 Or is it okay to make adjustments at any time without harming results?

Thanks in advance for any insights! 🙏
[26.07.25, 10:00:26] ~ Cocow😈: I don’t understand the point of doing this , normally when you test a creative you launch validates headlines , adcopys etc… 

The only thing you change is your creative to be able to isolate one variable to get clear data on your creative. 

If you want to test adcopys or headlines then you just have to copy your control creative and publish changes :) 

In any case , of the creative is really bad and you want to make some twists: 
- Not optimized as you cut the learning curve of the ad 
- ⁠probably if the creative does not work , changing these details will not make a huge difference 
- ⁠if your twists make the creative work then you learn nothing cause it can work just because of luck , momentum , coincidence or anything. These twists will not help you understand if what you have done made a difference. Maybe it did , maybe not , you will never know , so you could not really apply it for future creatives.

That is my vision , I prefer to get data and learn :)
[26.07.25, 10:38:55] ~ Musawer: for those who use Funnelish, did you guys enable the express checkout for Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc?
[26.07.25, 12:21:40] ~ Cocow😈: Hey team, 

People that are doing ADS on third party pages they own i have a question for you. 

Do you manage the comments and if yes how ? 

Positioning as the brand itself or let’s say this is a doctor page you answer as the doctor haha ? 

Thanks
[26.07.25, 12:31:10] ~ Rui Bessa: Apple Pay doesn’t pass the name of costumer to funnelish , it’s a big flaw we couldn’t solve it with their support.

[27.07.25, 9:34:38] ~ Musawer: Hi guys, im using funnelish and im selling on UK, IE, AU, but some of our customer attempting purchase but they cant buy, i reach out to one of them, they say it not accepting the credit card and they used visa, mastercard...

Anyone experienced this problem before? And how can i solve it. İm using stripe

Also do i need to turn on the express checkout?
[27.07.25, 11:46:45] Carlos Leeseman: Check your Stripe analytics, what is it saying? Are you selling cross-border with your Stripe?
[27.07.25, 11:49:50] Carlos Leeseman: (Cross-border selling means that you try to sell in the UK/Europe with a US Stripe account for example, or vice versa.)
[27.07.25, 11:51:01] ~ Musawer: The stripe success rate is around 60% and yes the account is from USA and we are selling to UK, AU, Ireland
[27.07.25, 11:53:02] Carlos Leeseman: Yep that is the problem. It’s really shit and that’s why MoR exist. You can try Reach for example or maybe Airwallex will work ‎<This message was edited>
[27.07.25, 11:56:36] ~ Musawer: Is there anything to do with stripe to solve it?
[27.07.25, 11:57:43] Carlos Leeseman: Open UK company
[27.07.25, 12:00:50] ~ Musawer: But i dont know why it not happened for our previous brand, it was same like this, US stripe account and selling on Europe, everything was fine
[27.07.25, 12:02:58] Carlos Leeseman: Some people say the success rate will increase after some time
[27.07.25, 12:03:34] ~ Musawer: I will try to reconnect the stripe maybe it will solve
‎[27.07.25, 16:48:32] ~ F: ‎image omitted
[27.07.25, 17:11:20] ~ John B: Yes the customers will see it, and at least for Florida where I’m from, the state wants you to show separately at checkout that you are charging sales tax - and I believe this is the case for many states. So you can’t really include it in the price and then not charge it at checkout.  Sales tax is very tedious once you reach nexus in many states. I recommend a platform called avalara if you’re scaling hard and plan to reach the nexus in other states quickly. If not you could try to register in each state yourself
[27.07.25, 17:18:45] ~ F: ok cheers brother, appreciate that
[28.07.25, 11:35:03] ~ David B: Hey everyone. There will be no copy call tomorrow. If you have any questions or need support with your copy, please DM me.
[28.07.25, 18:13:14] ~ L: Guys what’s the best website to find brolls in your opinion?
[28.07.25, 18:33:46] Carlos Leeseman: YouTube and TikTok for realistic footage.

But we make a lot with GPT, Kling and VEO 3 now, it’s crushing it and way faster then sourcing specific footage
[28.07.25, 18:51:17] ~ JULIUS: Would you mind sharing your process / SOP to get better at it 🙌
[28.07.25, 19:33:19] ~ Jacobo Uribe: There’s an AI course in the classroom that I made bro. Covers Kling and Veo 3
[28.07.25, 20:21:28] ~ Henry: Hey guys, does anyone know the best way to get a PT as an authority figure for your health & wellness brand? One that’s legit and actually has credibility. We’ve tried backstage and reaching out to actors on YT. Not looking promising on both so far
[28.07.25, 20:22:42] Topi: Headhunter lets you cherrypick if done well
[28.07.25, 20:29:34] ~ Jacob: 🧠 SOP: Generating Image + Video Prompts with AI Based on a Prepared Script
🎯 Goal:
Transform an existing ad script into a short, high-converting video.
Each scene should last 2–3 seconds and include:

Image Prompt (for generating a still image)

Image-to-Video Prompt (for animating that image into short video clips)

🔹 Step 1: Break the Script into Visual Scenes
Once you have your final voiceover script, send the AI this instruction:

🧾 Prompt #1 to paste into the AI:
I want you to take the following voiceover script for a Meta ad and break it into a full list of visual scenes. Each scene should be 2–3 seconds long, and describe exactly what should be happening visually in a way that emotionally supports the script and maximizes conversion.

For each scene, include:

A timestamp range (start and end time in seconds)

The exact words from the voiceover that this scene matches

A powerful visual description that could be used to create an image later

✅ What the AI will return:
A structured breakdown of scenes like this:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Scene 1 (0–3s)  
Script: “You don’t need to waste hours anymore”  
Visual: A woman sitting in a crowded place, looking at her watch impatiently. Harsh lighting, chaotic background, stressed expression.

Scene 2 (3–6s)  
Script: “Now there’s a smarter way”  
Visual: A sleek bottle gently rotating in soft spotlight, surrounded by elegant shadows and warm tones. Cinematic lighting, modern feel.
This breakdown includes:

Timing for editing

Exact words from the voiceover

A matching visual description

🔹 Step 2: Generate Image + Video Prompts for All Scenes at Once
Once you have the scene breakdown, use this instruction to get two prompts per scene — one for image generation and one for animation.

🧾 Prompt #2 to paste into the AI:
Now take the full list of scenes you just created, and for each scene write:

Image Prompt – written specifically for a 3rd-party image generator like Midjourney. It should be extremely detailed and specific, including camera type, lighting style, character description, background, and brand aesthetic. No text overlay should be included. Format must be vertical 9:16.

Video Prompt – written for an image-to-video AI tool (like Runway, HaLeo AI, or Pika). Describe exactly how to animate the image: what should move, how the camera behaves, any ambient effects (e.g., steam, light rays, motion blur), duration (2–3 seconds), and frame rate (25fps). Do NOT re-describe the image – just explain how it should move.

🧾 What is an “Image-to-Video AI”?
This is a tool that turns static images into short animated clips.
Recommended tools:

Runway ML

HaLeo AI

Pika Labs

✅ Example Output from the AI:
Scene 2 (3–6s)
Script: “Now there’s a smarter way”

Image Prompt:
Vertical 9:16 image of a modern, premium-looking product placed on a marble surface, softly lit from above. Shot with Canon EOS R5, 50mm lens, f/1.8. Cinematic mood, warm tones, gentle glow on the product surface. Inspired by luxury skincare or tech ads. No text overlay. --ar 9:16 --v 6

Video Prompt:
Use the generated image. Animate a slow zoom-in toward the product, add soft lens flare and floating light particles in the background. Duration: 2.5 seconds at 25fps. Camera movement is steady and elegant, premium feel.

🔹 Step 3: Image & Video Creation
Now take all the prompts the AI returned:

Paste each Image Prompt into Midjourney or another AI image generator

Once the image is ready, paste the Video Prompt into Runway, HaLeo, or similar

Download the resulting short video clips

💡 Pro Tip:
While some images are still rendering, begin animating the ones that are ready to save time.

🔹 Step 4: Assembling the Final Video
Import all short clips into your video editor

Add the recorded voiceover (VO)

Match each clip to the script segment based on the timestamps from Step 1

If a clip is too long – speed it up (e.g., 1.3x or 1.5x)

If a clip is too short – extend it with looped frames or slow ambient effects

Sync perfectly with the spoken words

🔹 Step 5: Polish & Export
Add the finishing touches:

Smooth transitions between scenes

Subtle visual effects (e.g., glow, blur, shine, hair movement)

On-screen captions or subtitles (if needed)

Background music or sound design

Export the final video as MP4 in 9:16 format for platforms like Instagram Reels, TikTok, or Meta Ads

[29.07.25, 13:04:51] ~ Musawer: Stripe blocking and declining  40%-50% customers payment anyone know how to solve it?
[29.07.25, 13:05:27] ~ RS: What country is your stripe registered and where you sell your products?
[29.07.25, 13:06:13] ~ Musawer: The stripe account is from US and im selling to UK - AU - IE
[29.07.25, 13:06:57] ~ Musawer: I contact them theyre saying the radar detect them as a fraud and blocking them
[29.07.25, 13:09:47] Matán Intsuper: Create new account
[29.07.25, 13:42:43] ~ Musawer: What payment provider you guys using instead of stripe
[29.07.25, 13:55:38] ~ David B: Just a quick reminder that there will be no copy call today. Please DM if there's anything you need help with. Thanks everyone. We will be back to normal in 2 weeks time.

[29.07.25, 21:25:50] ~ Mike Ramsey: Cross border rates are always going to have lower approval rates but that seems really low.  Are you using funnelish?
[29.07.25, 21:26:16] ~ Musawer: Yes im using funnelish
[29.07.25, 21:28:24] ~ Mike Ramsey: Would double check to ensure all is configured correctly, particularly 3DS.  Decline rates should be ~20%.   Not 40%

[30.07.25, 0:52:54] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Nice to meet you all guys btw, I just joined ESS 💪🏻 

I’m from Forlì, Italy 🇮🇹 🍝
[30.07.25, 0:53:57] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Then probably AB convert but I’m not sure which feature, probably URL split test
[30.07.25, 0:54:15] ~ Layton Schwenning: Their support had to add come code to fix it. i think it’s working now
[30.07.25, 0:56:24] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Nice! I’m on Funnelish but it seems like my market doesn’t love Funnelish checkout so I’m sending traffic to Shopify’s product page after the advertorial. Not the best practice though cause it’s hard to split test 🥲
[30.07.25, 5:01:10] ~ Rashid Samhan: Greetings from Bali! 🌴
We’ve touched down on this beautiful land — part work, part inspiration, and fully about building connections. If you’re also here, let’s turn this paradise into a networking opportunity.

Coffee by the beach? Sunset talk on scaling brands? Quick exchange of ideas that could spark the next big move?

Drop a message if you’re in Bali — let’s make something meaningful happen while we’re here.
[30.07.25, 8:38:09] ~ Musawer: Does anyone use Funnelish, clickfunnel or checkoutchamp and doing the checkout on Shopify?
[30.07.25, 15:27:44] ~ Mike Ramsey: Hey all - payments call will be cancelled today due to scheduling conflict.  

Will resume next week!

Thank you!
[30.07.25, 16:40:56] ~ Matt: Quick question. Does anyone have any recommendation for a Hong Kong attorney? We’re running into an issue with one of our distributors 🤦🏻‍♂️
[30.07.25, 16:46:33] ~ Adonis A: Has anyone here experienced a Gmail hack leading to campaigns being launched in your ad acct by hackers? Luckily the campaign they launched didn’t spend but now our original campaigns aren’t spending either so sales are way down

But when youtubing re:amaze, everyhting seems to be like 5 years ago. Are they outdated?
[31.07.25, 0:14:21] ~ Cocow😈: Are you searching for a platform or ? I am not sure I understand haha
[31.07.25, 0:15:39] ~ Allan L: My CS is answering e-mails in the e-mail Dashboard and on Facebook it self. There has to be better solutions
[31.07.25, 0:41:19] ~ Cocow😈: Email like outlook or Google workspace ?

Definitely use a tool to handle all of this

We use Richpanel 

Multi store 
AI translation 
Meta and other channels integration for DMs and comment 
Connect mail to do ticketing 

Basically , one tool and you can handle everything 

Even watsapp
[31.07.25, 0:45:19] ~ Allan L: Worse. Dont even know the name of it, the most used software for cheap e-mail hosts 😅

Richpanel look exactly like what I am looking for, thanks
[31.07.25, 0:57:11] Topi: @⁨~Allan L⁩ also check commslayer

[31.07.25, 1:23:05] ~ Cocow😈: Ah freshdesk maybe, work good as well :)
[31.07.25, 1:29:09] ~ JULIUS: @⁨~Allan L⁩ I personally use freshdesk, basically a copy of zendesk but cheaper. You will need a bit time to get used to it at first but then you can have great CS system in place
[31.07.25, 3:41:37] ~ Miika: Anyone who got a contact for getting better trustpilot reviews?
[31.07.25, 10:39:51] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, does anyone know how to send fake purchases to Facebook, for a specific ad?
[31.07.25, 10:49:28] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Not sure about this but how about placing test orders ? It works on shopify. You go to your ad you click on shop now and then you place the test order. 

Better is instead of placing a test order you go and give yourself a 100 off discount and then you never fulfill the orders (of course you need to click on your ad at the begenning)

Why do you want to send fake purchases to your ad ? ‎<This message was edited>
[31.07.25, 10:51:34] Carlos Leeseman: For one of our stores, tracking has stopped for 3 days, because of issues with our CAPI. Now I know the ad has really good results, because we can track sales in Shopify from that ad, but in Facebook the CPA is 3x doubled now. I calculated the actual ROAS is around 3, but Facebook is saying 1 now.
[31.07.25, 10:52:16] Carlos Leeseman: But maybe I will just let it go like this, it’s solved now. However all the sales are missing from last 3 days and it’s new product, so they are really important now to decide to kill or scale haha
[31.07.25, 13:30:35] ~ Jeremy: Does anyone have a good plug for agency ad accounts that accepts PayPal as a payment method?

[31.07.25, 20:20:17] ~ Guy Edan: Just spent the last 40 min doing one haha. basically gave claude the top 10 copywriters and told him to do a deep research on them and find summaries, articles, pdf books + sent him a long pdf of notes from a eugene schwartz book and told him to create a master document.

[1.08.25, 9:59:01] Fabian: Home page & about us you could consider, or where people’s intent is to go deeper about your brand.

But generally speaking I see most brands, even with good trustpilot for example, still not clickable
[1.08.25, 10:31:51] ~ David B: It's better to avoid any links that take people to non-revenue generating pages. I'm pretty sure you can embed custom Trustpilot widgets on your page and internally link them.

[2.08.25, 22:53:00] ~ Jacob: Hey everyone!
I’m looking for a Shopify app (or a creative workaround) that allows me to offer a tiered deal like this:

Buy 1 product → get 1 free gift

Buy 2 products → get 2 free gifts

Buy 3 products → get 3 free gifts


Ideally, I’d like to display this in a nice visual layout, like 3 separate offer boxes (1+1, 2+2, 3+3), each showing the deal and what gifts come with it.

What’s the best app or method you know to build something like this in Shopify — both functionally and visually?

Thanks in advance 🙏
[2.08.25, 23:02:29] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I believe that Katching bundles can do it
[3.08.25, 17:42:55] ~ Musawer: Anyone using shopify upsell app for other countries like UK, Australia, the one click upsell app not working for other countries i think
[3.08.25, 17:59:51] Matán Intsuper: Try BOGOS or Kite

[3.08.25, 18:36:28] ~ Jakub: You can check “UFE Cross Sell & Upsell Bundle”. Works perfectly for me. ‎<This message was edited>
[3.08.25, 18:37:44] ~ Musawer: Yeah but is it work for multi currency? Im selling to different countries at the same time
[3.08.25, 18:38:05] ~ Musawer: My store based on usa and im selling to uk, ireland, australia
[3.08.25, 18:40:43] ~ Jakub: Never tried it tbh, but in Shopify Store they say it should handle that
[3.08.25, 18:41:13] ~ Jakub: It has free install so you can give it a shot
[3.08.25, 18:41:37] ~ Musawer: Thanks i will check
[3.08.25, 19:48:14] ~ L: Guys something weird is happening here - 

We’re testing in ABO — Inside every Adset there are 8 different Ads, same body, different Hooks 

We’re spending 40€ p.day for each adset. 

The ads that are getting all the spend don’t have extremely low CPA. But in all the Adsets we have extremely low CPA for ADs that have spent like 5/10€. 

Would you bring into your scaling CBO the TOP Spender + The ones that didn’t spend much (but extremely good CPAs) or since we don’t have clear datas on who’s the winner we just have to keep testing?


It looks like the ones that didn’t spend much are retargeting those people that watched the first content, but it looks tricky now 😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[3.08.25, 19:53:08] ~ Kevin Krieg: Whatever app you use, be careful and make page speed test before and after installation. Duplicate theme beforehand.

Had some bundle apps in the past that fucked page speed. Cant remember which but they were super big from reputable app devs.

We do everything custom nowadays because of that experience (and for other reasons, but that was a big one)
‎[3.08.25, 20:08:31] ~ Jacob: ‎audio omitted
[3.08.25, 20:09:01] ~ Jacob: How long it took u to develop a custom app for offers?
[3.08.25, 20:17:56] ~ Kevin Krieg: You can do it with Sidekick and chatgpt in a few hours
[3.08.25, 20:18:27] ~ Kevin Krieg: Or find on upwork or in shopify devs registery, easy stuff
[3.08.25, 20:18:32] ~ Kevin Krieg: Nowadays super ez
[3.08.25, 20:19:02] ~ John B: This is how I test ads and run into this often. Most of the time i’ll bring both into the CBO once they reach a certain amount of purchases and the trend of some spend on the lower and most on the higher continues. If they’re good ads, i’ve noticed it will always be like this 80/20 split and the larger spend ad will have like 2.5-3.5 roas and the lower one will be crazy high like you mentioned, and it averages out in the CBO to be a good ROAS. If they die out, the biggest spender will go to a bad ROAS, you may turn it off thinking because the lower spender still has a good ROAS it just needs more spend it will do better, but it will also die out and get a bad ROAS. But there’s a lot to test within all of this, just what i’ve noticed, sometimes I don’t always bring both into the CBO.
[3.08.25, 20:59:48] ~ L: So they’re basically doing what I thought : the ones that are spending less are just retargeting the traffic that the bid spender is leaving behind.
For this reason I just brought all of them into the CBO - Since they’re all the same VSL but different HOOKs I’ve made an Adset for each VSL inside the CBO, is it something you usually do? 

Or, when this happens, you just duplicate them into the same adset with the other ones?

[3.08.25, 21:49:38] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Is anyone using flexible ads? I wanted to test images 4:5 and 9:16 and I think that if I use 9:16 putting the text not too close to the bottom facebook will crop it itself for each placement but if someone had good results using flexible ads I’m all ears
[3.08.25, 21:56:07] ~ Jacob: The problem with flexible is that you cant see winners
[3.08.25, 21:56:13] ~ Jacob: No breakdown
[3.08.25, 21:56:24] ~ Jacob: You aware of it?
[3.08.25, 21:57:14] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah I now but I would only use the same image in 2 formats and only one primary text, headline and description
[3.08.25, 21:57:36] ~ Giovanni Restelli: But As I said before, probably doesn’t make sense because Facebook does it itself
[3.08.25, 21:57:59] ~ Giovanni Restelli: But I’ve seen brands doing it, so yeah, I wanted to ask you all
[3.08.25, 22:46:57] ~ Cocow😈: Or do 4/5 for feed and 9/16 for reels and story

You can upload a 9/16 image for these formats in same ad
[3.08.25, 22:49:09] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah probably it’s the best option
[3.08.25, 23:35:07] ~ F: whats up everyone. we are currently using aimerce (pixel) but got recommended to switch to triple whale? whats the best option? our main focus is on facebook ads
[3.08.25, 23:38:00] ~ Cocow😈: You received recommendation to triple whale CAPI sonar or triple whale overall ?
[3.08.25, 23:40:29] ~ Ashton Morgan: Does triplewhale have better tracking than Wetracked?
[3.08.25, 23:44:59] ~ F: triple whale overall
[3.08.25, 23:48:35] ~ Cocow😈: Aimerce is mainly a CAPI so there goal is to feed Meta with events and make sure to maximise you attribution 

Triple whale overall is here to show you the attribution globally with all your channels with their attribution model and algorithm. You can as well add cogs, fixed and variable expenses and a lot more 

Triple whale sonar is like aimerce and wetracked. This is a CAPI 

Even if you install triple whale, you need a CAPI. Or you use aimerce or you use triple whale. However i cannot say what is best 🙂
[3.08.25, 23:49:52] ~ L: Is wetracked  a good solution for meta health restrictions ?
[3.08.25, 23:54:58] ~ Cocow😈: All solutions can now run with custom events so this would be your new « purchase » event but custom

However, in our case for example our domain was completely flagged and even using aimerce + custom events was shit. 

Now we use Bily. They use their domain to send the events, so we have no problems

We were using Bily, then tried Aimerce and 2 days after we came back to Bily cause 90% of our sales were not going into the ads manager, so this is not possible long term ‎<This message was edited>

[4.08.25, 11:02:33] ~ P: Does anyone using Funnelish know how to automatically collect sales tax and have the customer pay it at checkout based on their state?
[4.08.25, 13:23:11] ~ RS: Hey! There are thousands of bot traffic coming in my website every day at the same time and it triggers pageview event and fkcs up pixel data. I have set up cloudflare and another shopify app that promises to block and filter bot traffic but still these bots go around it. Are there any good tips to block this traffic? They are visiting only my policy pages using linux devices. Wetracked.io said that they will not change their code to exclude policy pages from pixel tracking and I hate wetracked company about that. I cannot do anything to prevent pixel from firing in policy pages, only wetracked can but they dont want to do it. 

Maybe there are other options to block this linux traffic or prevent pixel from catching these pageview events?
[4.08.25, 13:56:29] ~ Erik: ChatGPT says you can disable pixel for a specific page by changing the code
[4.08.25, 13:57:17] ~ RS: Yes, but my pixel is integrated via wetracked so only they can do this. And they refused to do it😀 Morons
‎[4.08.25, 14:18:21] ~ Erik: ‎image omitted

[4.08.25, 19:54:38] ~ Guy Edan: Do u find that younger audiences convert better on Shopify type pages and checkouts VS on funnelish?
[4.08.25, 20:20:29] Topi: Shopify especially in EU
[4.08.25, 20:25:34] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Older audiences in Europe also prefer Shopify?
[4.08.25, 20:27:10] Topi: Anything weve ever launched in funnelish or other funnels works better with shopify in EU

All audiences from my experience

My hypothesis is that the more it looks like regular web store, the more people trust or know how to buy
[4.08.25, 20:28:55] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Same, not a lot of data but as soon as I started sending traffic to Shopify after my advertorials they started doing better 😕
[4.08.25, 20:31:08] Topi: For me its amazing news. One less worry to think about in business, all the crazyness that comes with funnels
[4.08.25, 20:32:37] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Do you have experience with australian market ? @⁨Topi⁩   @⁨~Giovanni Restelli⁩
[4.08.25, 20:34:00] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I mean, I’m still on Funnelish but there’s no point of doing it because I can’t split test properly. I will probably move to GemPages if it makes more sense
[4.08.25, 20:34:08] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Nope 😕
[4.08.25, 21:46:54] ~ Num: thats include UK?
[4.08.25, 21:48:35] Topi: My experience, shopify pdp works amazing in the UK
[4.08.25, 23:48:05] ~ Zvi: With Funnelish, can you set up 4 different welcome flows, abandon cart, browse abandonement, post purchase for 9 different products we sell through 1 Shopify inside of 1 Klaviyo account WITHOUT it glitching and accidentally sending wrong emails to different customers

[5.08.25, 17:37:00] ~ Hunter Davenport: I am paying a guy to replicate my Shopify product page onto funnelish. Including the checkout page too. How much do you guys think is a fair price for this?

[5.08.25, 17:38:17] ~ L: 😂😂😂
[5.08.25, 17:40:06] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Besides that I have no clue, in the past someone asked me 150 but he would have done it for way less I guess, not sure though cause it ended up in nothing
[5.08.25, 17:40:49] ~ Hunter Davenport: lol he says he can ?
[5.08.25, 17:42:25] ~ Hunter Davenport: I just mean the design of it
[5.08.25, 17:42:29] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I mean, I think it’s impossible to replicate Shopify checkout but maybe he can do it very similar
[5.08.25, 17:42:38] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Oh okay okay
[5.08.25, 19:24:00] Matán Intsuper: Funnelish does that for you if I’m not mistaken
[5.08.25, 19:26:25] ~ Giovanni Restelli: only if you have the 199 plan
[5.08.25, 19:26:52] ~ Giovanni Restelli: But @⁨~Hunter Davenport⁩ will need it so you’re right
[5.08.25, 19:29:25] ~ Giovanni Restelli: One free template a month
[5.08.25, 19:43:08] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Which shopify app to use to recreate Funnelish funnel? PageFly, Gempages? Any ideas?

[6.08.25, 4:02:14] ~ Austin: This was one of my longest running and highest spending ads....It seemed the more low quality the better performance, there was never a pattern I've spotted in terms of what mashups work or why, so I'd say test a lot here
[6.08.25, 10:11:09] ~ Mikael: Anyone else having issues with Klarna on Shopify payments? We run in the Nordic countries and launched afew new stores last month. some of them allready got Klarna de-activated despite minimal Disputes and super slow scaling.
[6.08.25, 13:33:01] ~ Jake: Hi guys

[8.08.25, 19:36:38] ~ Rui Bessa: Anyone here know a good service to buy Facebook ad comments on live ads? Goal is to boost engagement and hopefully bring CPMs down.
[8.08.25, 19:56:57] ~ Hunter Davenport: https://social-fanclick.com/facebook-kommentare-USA-netherland.htm
[8.08.25, 19:58:13] ~ Rui Bessa: Thanks mate! have you used this before?
[8.08.25, 19:59:40] ~ Hunter Davenport: Yeah a few times. It’s cheap and works. I think it takes 1-2 days for the comments to show up. I wish you could control what the avatar looks like but you can’t so don’t make any comments that are too specific relating to their gender or profession
[8.08.25, 20:00:28] ~ Rui Bessa: understood. i will give it a try. I just need to give it my ad link right? no need to post the ad on the page?

[8.08.25, 21:01:56] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Have you ever bought comments on an ad right after publishing it? 

I feel like my best winners are ads where people start talking to each other sharing their experiences etc
[8.08.25, 21:03:09] ~ Rui Bessa: For sure and lowers the CPMs…I used to use proxy + vpn to do it manually , but I’m gonna try this service
[8.08.25, 21:04:18] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah I also have a telegram contact of a company that has many real profiles so if people check their profile it looks very real
[8.08.25, 21:05:24] ~ Giovanni Restelli: It would be nice in case of you’re testing something you put a lot of effort into

[8.08.25, 21:09:14] ~ Jacob: Ye
[8.08.25, 21:09:28] ~ Jacob: First of all, you can mix
[8.08.25, 21:10:19] ~ Jacob: You need to find good examples and good promts , and use the ai to create the promts for the image to video
[8.08.25, 21:11:04] ~ Jacob: And try ask it to write as json promts
[8.08.25, 21:11:28] ~ Jacob: And ask the ai to give you 3/4 variations of promts
[8.08.25, 21:11:50] ~ Carter Mac: Have you guys found GPT5 to be any better at copywriting? Or is Claude still #1
[8.08.25, 21:11:55] ~ Jacob: I used halleo ai and i got nice results

[8.08.25, 22:06:27] ~ F: after how much rev/m it’s profitable to get the shopify plus plan?
[8.08.25, 22:08:56] ~ Cocow😈: Depends on how much shops you have
[8.08.25, 22:10:09] ~ Cocow😈: If one shop , only selling US with no currency conversion with shopify payments , at 10M a year you are approx Breakeven 

Then for sure , this is excluding any conversion uplifts you can achieve with checkout optimizations
[9.08.25, 0:17:00] ~ F: amazing thanks brother
[9.08.25, 0:17:09] ~ 🥇: Hey guys, in a payout hold case, does Shopify Plus actually give direct access to the finance team, or is it still the same as normal support? My case has been escalated endlessly in chat with no real solution. Anyone here know an insider who can actually fix this, or has dealt with this before and found a way to solve it? Any advice?
[9.08.25, 15:21:07] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: For EU markets, should I use 1 pixel per market or 1 pixel for all EU?
And what about ad accounts? ‎<This message was edited>
[9.08.25, 15:25:35] ~ Allen David Shor: Recommended 1 pixel x EU. Ad accounts up to you.
[9.08.25, 15:36:03] ~ Jakub: Hey guys! When I get some traction on my ad account and the performance goal "maximize value of conversions" unlocks - should I set all my adsets to that, or stay in "maximize number of conversions"? Which one do you prefer?
[9.08.25, 15:44:54] ~ Allen David Shor: Hey, not necessarily set it to all. Test out what budget split works best for caps/value/highest volume.,
[9.08.25, 16:03:20] Topi: Anyone has a plug to buy instagram themepages?
[9.08.25, 18:34:38] ~ Jacobo Uribe: Hey guys, anyone running an HK structure that was able to set up Shopify Payments without a local personal Tax ID? 

They don’t take a US passport in the set up process, only an HKID. Although apparently in their policy they say it’s OK to use a passport instead. 

Waiting to hear back from Shopify Support (who also said it’s possible) but want to see what others in my situation have done as it’s been a few days and still waiting.
[9.08.25, 19:45:31] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Guys, on Clarity is it enough to connect our Funnelish domain/subdomain and put the code inside all the funnels or we have to create a project for each funnel/advertorial? Hope the question is clear
[9.08.25, 19:52:55] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Never mind, it’s related to the domain so it’s enough to have one project and use the same code on each funnel
[9.08.25, 20:53:52] ~ Kevin Krieg: We prefer nunber of conversions, not value. But each offer is different, heard people get better results with value as well
[9.08.25, 21:15:05] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: if you have a one product store, the best is number of conversions. If you are using lots of upsells and have differnet products that people can buy together, then that's where you use value of conversions.
[9.08.25, 21:32:51] ~ Cocow😈: Hello team 

Is anyone using MP4 autoloop on funnelish and have found a good way to make it work across all devices and with the less impact possible on performance of page ? We know there is the autoloop function in funnelish but trying to find an easier way 

Thanks 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[11.08.25, 15:05:30] ~ Cocow😈: You have to custom code your bundle so that this adds 3 products straight away and your discount will apply. For the gifts , same process custom code to add the gifts into checkout 

This costs a bit of money but at least you are clean. However , when you start custome code bundles keep in mind you will always need the hand of a developer ‎<This message was edited>
[11.08.25, 15:35:44] ~ F: ok thanks brother. does anyone have the contact for a good developer?
[11.08.25, 18:44:54] ~ Rui Bessa: Whats the best PRICE A/B testing plug-in for shopify pdp?
[11.08.25, 19:01:33] Malachi: prolly AB convert
[11.08.25, 19:38:48] ~ Henry: Hey guys, does anyone know an alternative to Lucky Orange for tracking Gempages and Shopify PDP? I use it mainly for tracking my advertorial CTR so need something that can do that. Lucky Orange is just so expensive
[11.08.25, 20:11:17] ~ Kevin Krieg: We like the oldschool method of having a redirect to a new product with the new price. So not changing price dynamically on the same product.

Because this way you can verify the CRO tool's numbers by checking sales of each product in the backend more easily. Also less prone to bug out.

We use ABlyft for this. Tried abconvert in the past. Prefer ablyft

It usually takes few hours or even less but if you don’t delete your history and cache you still get this error even if you got the SSL certificate
[12.08.25, 3:53:58] ~ F: we are getting the shopify plus plan tomorrow and would like to know what are the first split tests we should run. what made the most diifference for you all on checkout?

[13.08.25, 15:50:23] ~ Austin: Hey guys, when you conduct a group interview do you literally have 10-20 people on a call, asking the same question to each candidate and just go down the line? Do you find this more effective then 1:1 in early stages of hiring process?
[13.08.25, 15:55:49] ~ David B: I would try and cut it down to 5 at a time maximum. Separate out your most promising candidates and start with them. Then, if they don't hit the markers you want from them, go to the next 5. I'm sure others here will have suggestions too.
[13.08.25, 16:09:22] Carlos Leeseman: And let them do a trial phase, works really great for us so far. If it’s for copywriting, let them all share their screen so you can see their process. If it’s for strategist role, let them analyse your top creatives and let them make iteration concepts, etc. ‎<This message was edited>
[13.08.25, 16:11:51] ~ Luka: 100% should have them do a video to see their work. We’re just interviewed 3 video editors today that we filtered and they’re all doing a test video so we can see their work using our assets
[13.08.25, 16:13:00] Carlos Leeseman: Yes for video editors that is a must for us and works really great. This will help you filter at least 80% already
[13.08.25, 16:13:02] ~ Luka: We always do 1-on-1 interviews (2 rounds. 1st is with the creative strategist, and then the final confirmation with me). You get to know the person you’re hiring on a deeper level, to see if they’re career focused, back story etc. Lots of valuable info
[13.08.25, 16:36:58] ~ Austin: Thank you guys for the feedback. My thoughts on a group interview is with 10-15 candidates answering back to back it seems they'd be making their answers based off what you want to hear as they have time to think and prepare based off of others response. I think the 1:1 or pre-sent looms is the way to go. Then jump into a more detailed interview based off the qualified candidates from the original.
[13.08.25, 16:38:08] ~ Austin: Are there any major green flags you look for in a marketing strategist? Someone who's going to be overseeing your funnels and creatives?
[13.08.25, 16:46:08] Carlos Leeseman: We’re in the middle of hiring a new creative strategist, so here is what I’m doing:

I’m mainly looking for someone who thinks strategically, not just executing tasks, but actually identifying bottlenecks and figuring out what moves the needle. They should be data drivn but not data blind. Meaning they know how to interpret numbers with context and turn them into real insights. Strong creative judgment is a must, they should be able to explain clearly why something worked or didn’t, and this is exactly something you can test in a trial phase. For me this is super important in order to come up with new iteration and concept ideas. 

I also really value people who improve systems. Someone who brings structure, helps track iterations, and makes the whole process more scalable.

I want someone who takes initiative, brings ideas to the table, and leads the process rather than waiting to be told what to do. Lastly, they should think beyond just the ad itself and consider how each creative fits into the bigger brand and funnel strategy. If someone has all that, it’s pretty sure they are a great fit
[13.08.25, 16:54:08] ~ Austin: That's golden man, thank you for sharing and I completely agree!
[13.08.25, 19:01:25] ~ Matthew Martorano: Anyone heading to AW Budapest in a couple of weeks? We are co-hosting a rooftop party on the 4th. If you are interested, I can send you the invite. DM me.
[14.08.25, 11:23:27] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: I used my passport number and it worked
[14.08.25, 11:32:38] ~ Henry: hey guys, does anyone have a referral for someone to improve website speed?
[14.08.25, 11:59:33] Matán Intsuper: For Shopify I used fiverr and they did a great job

[14.08.25, 14:42:54] ~ Luka: Use GTMetrix for a detailed analysis. FCP is crucial. GTMetrix shows you a screenshot of your page on timestamps so you see what actually loads and how fast
[14.08.25, 14:43:12] ~ Giovanni Restelli: That is exactly my concern but it looks good so far, how can we detect that?
[14.08.25, 14:43:34] ~ Ziga: Don't know
[14.08.25, 14:43:42] ~ Ziga: maybe ask good ol' chatgpt
[14.08.25, 14:44:38] ~ Ziga: How do you guys source content for VSLs? Any go to places? Any workflow that speeds this up?

[14.08.25, 14:56:29] ~ Giovanni Restelli: OK, yeah I’m pretty sure I got scammed 😂 because when I let a tool check the speed in the report The website is not the same. It has these big grey bands instead of my product photos and all the stuff. I’ll delete my previous message so nobody gets scammed like me 😅

[14.08.25, 19:06:46] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I think I’m gonna use another browser for it only
[14.08.25, 19:51:51] ~ Henry: for regular stock footage, use Google VEO

‎[16.08.25, 17:40:22] ~ F: ‎image omitted
[17.08.25, 0:28:25] Alex  Fedotoff: If it’s $2500 and the ad prints much more than that, pay. But as a part of the deal ask for more content from her that you can use in the future. So you get more value for your $$$

If anyone knows some talent. Let me know.

Would really help us out!
[17.08.25, 11:42:01] ~ Barnabás: Hey guys, what do you think how big of a risk am I taking if I sell a product that doesn’t have FDA approval? I see that a lot of people are already selling it in the US, some even making over $1M per month. My question is: could it cause serious problems if I start selling larger volumes?
[17.08.25, 13:37:46] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Hey guys, google pixel setup is still the same as it is in the course? The dashboard looks a bit different but I think it’s still the same process
[17.08.25, 15:15:52] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Yessir! Its still the same for shopify
[17.08.25, 16:23:29] ~ Ислам: Are you guys all experiencing sales decline since April? Since Facebook removed old advantage sales campaign?
[17.08.25, 17:28:03] ~ Lauren: So @⁨~Barnabás⁩ I work on the cosmetics / lifestyle / supplements side of things in terms of product development and help my clients clear for regulatory.

It depends on the product and if sold in a major retailer and the claims you make.

Retailers will want the factory to be fda certified. 

If you are making certain claims it has to be substainted with clinical testing.

If it something classified as otc / drug it needs to be fda certified.

I make things for ulta / sally / Sephora / Costco / Sally’s / TJ Maxx etc. 

If you pm me and give me more details I can provide a more detailed and specific answers. ‎<This message was edited>
[17.08.25, 21:02:07] ~ Barnabás: Thank you so much for your detailed answer, it was extremely helpful! 🙏
Fortunately, the product does not fall under the drug/OTC category but is rather positioned as a cosmetic/vitamin, so the regulatory risk is not as significant in this case, i think.
[17.08.25, 21:28:21] ~ Lauren: @⁨~Barnabás⁩ I take care of sourcing and development for those kinds of things.

I’ll pm you, because if you give me some more details I can tell you exactly what you need.

That’s what the group is for! 🫡
[17.08.25, 22:02:35] ~ Jakub: Hey guys! Does anyone have some pre-sale advertorial page / pages examples that are killing it right now? Ideally in skincare / beauty niche. I would like to create one for my brand but cannot find any inspiration so far.
[17.08.25, 22:02:59] Matán Intsuper: Why don’t you check the ad library?
[17.08.25, 22:03:49] ~ Jakub: Just checking through Gethookd but nothing so far.
[17.08.25, 22:23:46] ~ Jakub: nvm found some

[17.08.25, 23:11:54] ~ Elad Ezra: Perfect brother we have a meeting on Tuesday 🙏🏼
[18.08.25, 0:01:45] Fabian: Broad question, 

Just launched in US 3 weeks ago, 

Started with 350$ CPM’s, 
Then gradually went down to now about 170$

Looking to scale more, the rest of the numbers are looking good (much better than Europe)

I’m sure some of you experienced this as well, just curious about how you guys approached this, and maybe some actions you took to enable you to scale (by lowering cpm’s / finding another solution)

(In Europe we’re seeing €20 cpm’s)
[18.08.25, 7:18:38] ~ Jeremy Leppink: I just launched in US as well, im at about $150 CPMs right now. What i am going to do is test a couple different ad accounts / bms, different format ads, different angles and a bunch of static variations to different prelanders.
[18.08.25, 7:18:46] ~ Jeremy Leppink: should do the trick
[18.08.25, 7:20:26] ~ Matthew Darrel Wood: I have 9 dollar CPM’s.  Idk how but you can look at em
[18.08.25, 7:21:20] ~ Jeremy Leppink: in US? 😂
[18.08.25, 7:21:27] ~ Matthew Darrel Wood: Yeah
[18.08.25, 7:21:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: thats amazing
[18.08.25, 7:22:13] ~ Matthew Darrel Wood: Don’t worry, my horrible ads counteract it
[18.08.25, 15:12:47] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Anyone has a tiktok insider for unbanning ad accounts?
[18.08.25, 17:31:22] ~ Joo Han Lee: ‎~ Thomas Quinteros added ~ Joo Han Lee
[18.08.25, 20:00:37] ~ Lauren: So my friend works as a beauty / supplements broker for a home shopping channel, and they are looking for new brands for holiday sales.

A lot like QVC but smaller, though they air in 70 million households.

Her one client does $80k a month on air, and they do small test orders of like 1200. No returns to vendor. 

Wondering if anyone is interested and I can pass you along:
[18.08.25, 20:45:05] ~ Barnabás: Hey guys, what do you think about quiz funnels? Do they generally perform better for you compared to like advertorials, or do you find there’s no real difference maybe even worse conversions in some cases? 

I’ve watched Mark’s new video on quiz funnels a couple of times, but I don’t have any hands on experience yet. 

It would also take me a bit more time to properly learn and build out a quiz funnel compared to a straightforward advertorial, especially since I haven’t validated the market I’d be launching it in. What’s your take on this? What has your experience been like with quiz funnels? ‎<This message was edited>
[18.08.25, 20:46:57] ~ Michael Abovyan: Looking to hire a graphic designer full time, does anyone know of any good communities?
[18.08.25, 20:47:21] ~ Michael Abovyan: have done close a 100 interviews from upwork and no luck there
[18.08.25, 20:50:45] ~ Eliezer Blas: ‎~ Salma Jimenez added ~ Eliezer Blas

[19.08.25, 0:57:37] ~ Austin: Can someone please connect me with a good Funnelish developer? They definitely need to be good with code.
[19.08.25, 1:06:38] ~ L: Guys we need URGENTLY a Meta insider who’s able to unban 2/3 BMs 

We’re willing to pay a commission to whoever is able to help!
[19.08.25, 6:21:46] ~ Cocow😈: We do 

1. Google form with 10 questions + approx + ask a loom video
2. ⁠ask the expected salary (so that you get an idea of the price of the market. Ask where they live to be able to understand the differences in expected salary) 
3. Receive a good volume of people I would say 50 
4. Filter the answers and select 5 or more 
5, Do groups call with 4/5 candidates 

Goal ? Filtering and having less and less people in your funnel 🤣 And not wasting time with the ones that u know won’t fit 

No loom -> Out 
No reach your budget salary -> Out
Group call -> you are going to see by yourself that some do not fit , out 

From all of this process , you have made one or 2 interviews and you went down from 50 to 5 candidates 

Finally with this we 

1. Send a test project with 3-5 tasks 
2. ⁠We still filter 
3. ⁠make interview with the best candidates ( at least 2 to be able to compare) 

On all of this you made 3-5 calls maximum

Hiring full time people on upwork is achievable , but they will likely have other tasks , other upwork projects at the same time. You have to give your vision , and long term so that they feel comfortable being dedicated to you and for sure good condition
[19.08.25, 6:22:44] ~ Cocow😈: If you have to do 100 interviews , your process needs to be revised :)
[19.08.25, 6:25:03] ~ Michael Abovyan: this is our exact process rn
[19.08.25, 6:25:29] ~ Michael Abovyan: tried online jobs .ph and fb groups and it was a game changer
[19.08.25, 11:35:34] ~ Pavel in HK: try Kazan Solutions +31 40 229 1682
[19.08.25, 11:35:47] ~ Pavel in HK: which fb groups?
[19.08.25, 11:38:16] ~ Jakub: Does anyone here ever tried Pinterest ads? My target audience on one of my stores are women 45+, so I’m thinking about giving it a shot. Any experience? Thanks
[19.08.25, 12:16:07] ~ 👀: Yes I do. Which market are you selling?
[19.08.25, 13:44:23] ~ Rui Bessa: Is anyone here selling consumable products? We’re building a re-purchase email flow and would love to hear tips on the angles that work best to encourage repeat purchases(eg:future pace results,testimonials,before/after,etc)
[19.08.25, 13:45:43] Matán Intsuper: our method is to remind them to use it and consume it, and give usage tips so they finish it fast, and then offer them refill for a discount
[19.08.25, 13:45:50] Matán Intsuper: also you can try to push them into a subscription
[19.08.25, 13:46:34] Matán Intsuper: good to see you here @⁨~Rui Bessa⁩ btw :)
[19.08.25, 14:07:20] ~ Jakub: It's a store selling digital product where I help these women to get organized / plan things.
[19.08.25, 14:08:18] Matán Intsuper: i tried in the past, i'm still making money from organic posts i made years ago
[19.08.25, 14:08:25] Matán Intsuper: its possible to profit there
[19.08.25, 15:07:22] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: I have been working with funnelish in EU with 1 pixel for many EU markets.  
Now I'll transfer to shopify to try a higher CVR.
How should I go about the pixel? Same one as used for funnelish?
[19.08.25, 15:07:45] ~ Jeremy Leppink: yes
[19.08.25, 19:09:22] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Is the advertorial call happening?
[19.08.25, 19:19:46] ~ Barnabás: I think no, im waiting too
[19.08.25, 19:27:49] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah, it’s already half an hour or so I don’t think it’s gonna happen
[19.08.25, 20:15:33] ~ Jakub: I was hoping for that call too
[19.08.25, 21:55:42] ~ Austin: Hey guys, I've launched on funnelish with an IDENTICAL page / check out and everything you can imagine, but out CR is down by about half, would you know why this is?
[19.08.25, 22:11:41] ~ Cocow😈: So you launched ads on sales page directly ? Or advertorials ? 

We have actually exactly same issue. Horrible CVR overally with bund of tests
[19.08.25, 22:20:12] ~ Eliezer Blas: My CR is down too
[19.08.25, 23:51:00] ~ John B: For a brand new Google Ads account, should I start with a search ads campaign, let this collect data and try to find some good keywords, and then start performance max, or just start with both Pmax and a search ads campaign? Any advice helps, thank you!! 🙏🏻
[19.08.25, 23:54:16] ~ Eliezer Blas: I’ve had success with using keywords I think would work and using some ChatGPT thought would work and started with a low budget. Like $10 per day. Then google ads will tell you which ones are good and which ones are not or to up the budget. So far, I’ve used it to kinda just catch people at the bottom of my funnel who are still thinking of buying. But it’s important to start with a relatively low budget
[20.08.25, 0:05:22] ~ John B: why is it important to start with a low budget?
[20.08.25, 0:08:18] ~ Eliezer Blas: Because if you do a high budget right away, it might spend your budget on people not even looking for your product or brand
[20.08.25, 0:08:29] ~ Eliezer Blas: Are you thinking of running ads only on google ads?
[20.08.25, 0:14:03] ~ Eliezer Blas: Is anyone here selling products in the nicotine niche and has a winning advertorial I can get some inspiration from?
[20.08.25, 0:15:00] ~ Eliezer Blas: Or just in the general health & wellness
[20.08.25, 0:16:18] ~ John B: Theoretically, couldn’t this also happen with a lower budget? I see what you’re saying, but is it not like facebook, where the more you spend, the more data you receive? So if I start with a higher budget, of course making sure i optimize it day by day, the quicker I would get through that learning phase? Sorry for all the questions just trying to learn this before I start 😂
[20.08.25, 0:17:17] ~ John B: We started on meta, still running those, but now want to do google ads also
[20.08.25, 0:29:17] ~ Eliezer Blas: Google ads works on searches. No one is gonna force someone to search something. So that’s why meta ads will get your brand and or products name in their head, then google ads comes to play when people actually type in your brand into google. With meta it’s different because it’s cold traffic and it forces to be on peoples screens. Google ads is completely different
[20.08.25, 0:45:21] ~ John B: I see, thank you for the explanation
[20.08.25, 0:46:11] ~ Eliezer Blas: Glad to help 👍🏻
[20.08.25, 15:39:41] Topi: Hey team, VSL call late 15 minutes. Starting in 5
[20.08.25, 15:44:36] Topi: VSL call live
[20.08.25, 16:07:36] ~ Farhat Godil: Hello all can meta just delete your facebook page without prior warning?
[20.08.25, 16:08:13] ~ Allen David Shor: Yes
[20.08.25, 16:19:04] ~ Farhat Godil: without any warning whatsoever? and no reason as well
[20.08.25, 16:19:45] ~ Allen David Shor: If you violated community policy it can delete it without a warning, yes
[20.08.25, 16:19:50] ~ Allen David Shor: Can you drop me your page?
[20.08.25, 16:20:07] ~ Allen David Shor: Or the type of content you post/ advertise
[20.08.25, 16:21:44] ~ Lauren: I have to launch a social media page and have some engagement. So, the brand seems real.

I’m launching it in about 2 weeks or less.

Does anyone have a good place you buy followers that show some type of engagement with the post?

Sorry if this is covered already. 🙏
[20.08.25, 21:17:14] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Hey guys! Today I got 5 sales from my google brand name campaign but on Facebook the untracked sales are less than 5 so is it possible that they have gotten counted by both Meta and Google? Maybe one person saw the ad, and before buying he searched “is MyBrand” safe, then he bought and the sale was counted by both the platforms? ‎<This message was edited>
[20.08.25, 21:18:09] ~ Jeremy: Yes, this is quite common
[20.08.25, 21:18:26] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Alright thank you 🙏🏻
[20.08.25, 21:21:43] ~ L: Guys one question - how frequently do you re-use the same Hook?

I have 14 VSLs and wanted to make something like 10Hooks to get to 140 ads to launch 

But then the 14 VSLs will always start with the same 10 HOOKs and I’m afraid people will skip one VSL just because they’ve already seen the Hook (even if not from that VSL) 

I don’t know if my question is clear 😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[20.08.25, 22:01:50] Malachi: hey funnelish question for somebody - on one of my upsells, when customers click the button to “say no” to the upsell, it is still adding the item to their order and charging them. IT is set up as “OTO - no link” which works fine for the rest of the funnel, does anyone know why this could be happening, and how to fix it?
[20.08.25, 22:23:56] ~ Carter Mac: Does anyone know any good US based manufacturers for supplements?
[20.08.25, 22:25:24] ~ Jeremy: @⁨~Lauren⁩
[20.08.25, 22:37:50] ~ Lauren: I work with the cms who made goli and all the Sephora brands and Golden Hippo / City cosmetics supplements @⁨~Carter Mac⁩ . I develop them as well. ‎<This message was edited>
[20.08.25, 22:57:23] ~ Nico Neumann: I don‘t think you need to worry about people seeing the same hook twice when testing. Your TAM is surely far bigger than the total amount of people you target when testing those ads. That means frequency will be low, so probably not a lot of people will get the same hook twice.

Also I‘d make sure that every hook fits with the lead of the VSL. When you have 10 Hooks probably not all of them are going to fit well with your 14 VSLs.

When testing we usually create 3 hooks per concept with 2 scroll stoppers each.
[20.08.25, 23:02:45] ~ Eliezer Blas: Which one do you guys like better for UGC videos: arc ads, captions, or top view? 

I’ve only used arc ads before
[20.08.25, 23:03:11] ~ Jon McDougall: @⁨~Carter Mac⁩ we (Kanary Solutions) can also assist if you are looking for more than one option.  Feel free to DM me, we work with FDA registered manufacturers in the US as well as China for white label and custom formulation in multiple product categories for both supplements and cosmetics, but @⁨~Lauren⁩ contacts are great option as well 👍.
[20.08.25, 23:03:43] ~ Lauren: Thank you @⁨~Jon McDougall⁩ that’s super nice of you to say! 🤗
[20.08.25, 23:04:39] ~ Jon McDougall: @⁨~Lauren⁩ absolutely, it would be great to hop on a call and discuss synergies as well if you have time early next week just DM me and we will work it out 👍.
[20.08.25, 23:05:00] ~ Lauren: @⁨~Jon McDougall⁩ will do right now!
[20.08.25, 23:05:13] ~ Jon McDougall: @⁨~Lauren⁩ sounds good!
[20.08.25, 23:13:17] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Guys, I’m not at a very high level yet and I’m trying to understand what to improve in my product. If 70% of my customers like it and 30% of them don’t , what should be the move? I think that we can’t get to 100% satisfied customers but would you start improving already or maybe just focus on scaling for now?
[20.08.25, 23:46:42] eCommerce Scaling Secrets: ‎~ Joo Han Lee added ~ Abdulrauf Alhariri and ‪+46 76 134 75 61‬
[21.08.25, 5:55:38] ~ Ислам: Can someone recommend who can do professional advertorial?
[21.08.25, 6:35:00] ~ Lauren: I can’t speak to the scaling @⁨~Giovanni Restelli⁩ . But from a product perspective 70/30 ratio is not bad. What I would look at is what they don’t like and is it easy to fix.

Fragrance, easy fix. Results, depending on claims not so easy. 

I would say make the customer user expierence the best and the rest - people will always complain. 

Look at the return rate. Generally mine for my products is 2 - 3% and thats considered a good job. Well from my understanding, people may have better informed opinions on the group. ‎<This message was edited>
[21.08.25, 7:36:59] ~ Layton Schwenning: CPMs are insanely high on a new meta ad account for me. Anyone else dealing with this?
[21.08.25, 7:37:24] ~ L: Yeah, they’ll lower overtime
[21.08.25, 12:53:39] ~ Jeremy: Hey guys. When optimizing VSLs, we've been mainly testing new hooks and leads. Do you test new thumbnails and closes too or just hooks & leads, and if so, how much emphasis do you place on this vs hooks & leads? ‎<This message was edited>
[21.08.25, 13:22:43] ~ Jeremy: Another question - do you still test new creatives in ABO or do it in CBO? What are the pros and cons in your experience?
[21.08.25, 13:44:13] ~ Rui Bessa: Hey Guys, whats the best subscription app for shopiffy? im leaning towards SEAL. SUBSCRIPTIONS, but would like to know your thoughts

[21.08.25, 16:31:09] ~ Ömer Karakullukçu: Hey guys, what is the optimal screen time on page for advertorials? My advertorial has 10 seconds user average time on page. I think i need to improve it. What do you think?
[21.08.25, 16:35:51] ~ Ömer Karakullukçu: Also bounce rate is %30
[21.08.25, 17:42:10] ~ Alessandro: Hi guys

[21.08.25, 19:59:08] ~ Eliezer Blas: 30 percent bounce rate is super low. Either your content on your advertorial is bad and not understanding or it’s not congruent to your product page
[21.08.25, 19:59:35] ~ Eliezer Blas: A 30% bounce rate should be yielding optimal results
[21.08.25, 20:00:53] ~ Eliezer Blas: It doesn’t depend on the screentime. It depends on the conversion rate
[21.08.25, 22:29:25] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨~Mike Ramsey⁩
[21.08.25, 22:52:02] ~ Akos: Hi @⁨~Alessandro⁩ if your store location is a country where Shopify payments is available they no longer offer Stripe, you should be able to deactivate Shopify payments if you are not going to use it and add stripe but if there are no options to deactivate; a workaround that worked for me before was changing the store location to a country without Shopify payments link stripe and then change the country location back. Stripe should remain connected in this case

[23.08.25, 15:34:21] ~ Luka: Is the supplement legal? Not sure if Meta would deny you for it, but Asia has a lot stricter laws with supplements. For example, melatonin cannot be sold without a doctor’s prescription
[23.08.25, 15:38:24] ~ Andrew Wan: Its all legal.  Just a basic fiber supplement

It says that it needs some data (obviously there is non on the brand new account). Do I have to run any "Consideration" campaigns before switching to Conversions? Thanks 🙏
[24.08.25, 13:49:51] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Hi all, 

How much should an animation designer charge per animation ? 

Animation : I am talking about those animation we use for the VSLs and advertorials ‎<This message was edited>
[24.08.25, 14:14:56] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Guys, I say my offer inside the advertorial. Is there a way I can test a new offer besides taking the best performing ads and relaunch them changing their landing page?
[24.08.25, 14:16:54] ~ Rui Bessa: Not sure I understood , but if you want to test a new offer for the same traffic with the same destination URL you can do A/B test on that page
[24.08.25, 14:19:52] ~ Giovanni Restelli: The problem is that if I change my offer on Shopify, I have to change it also in my advertorial otherwise people will see a different offer between advertorial and product page
[24.08.25, 14:20:59] ~ Rui Bessa: gonna send you private message
[24.08.25, 14:21:10] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Thank you 🙏🏻
[24.08.25, 17:35:15] ~ Jake: For everyone selling worldwide. 

How do you deal with the GST in Canada and Australia for example?

Any advice?
[24.08.25, 17:53:20] ~ Jeremy: I noticed that during some hours of the day, we usually have very poor ad performance, and are wasting money. So I was wondering if you guys ever turn ads off during certain hours, and turn them back on later.
[24.08.25, 17:55:07] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I don’t think that turning them off is a good think but I’m noticing the same. Maybe overall the ROAS is 1.8 but for example between 6am and 10am it’s 1.2 and between 10am and 14am it’s 2.2 so I don’t really know if there’s something we could do
[24.08.25, 17:55:56] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Surf scaling could work sometimes but it doesn’t solve the problem of wasting money in some hours of the day
[24.08.25, 17:58:14] ~ Jeremy: So you think turning them off and on would mess with the algorithm?
[24.08.25, 17:58:15] ~ 👀: On how much daily budget are we talking?
[24.08.25, 17:59:04] ~ Jeremy: About $5k
[24.08.25, 17:59:35] ~ 👀: You need the first conversion with the pinterest tracking set up and after that you can select it
[24.08.25, 18:00:28] ~ Luka: We use madgicx to automate this. You get the historical ROAS for every hour of the week and create an automation to turn off ads during unprofitable hours
[24.08.25, 18:02:14] ~ Jeremy: Nice! Thought about using madgicx for this too. Have you seen a significant lift from this? @⁨~Luka⁩
[24.08.25, 19:31:55] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I am selling in Australia, not yet registered for the gst but as far as I know it's like any other VAT out there
[24.08.25, 20:42:57] ~ Jake: Got it.

I guess just have to register when passing the threshold

[25.08.25, 4:19:03] ~ Daniyal: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩ What agent would you recommended, We sell lots of products so Ecom ops wasn’t a good fit
[25.08.25, 4:19:20] ~ Austin: Personally have not had an issue with AI rejection using Arcads or GPT images
[25.08.25, 4:22:05] ~ Carter Mac: I made a podcast style video ad using Veo 3 and it got instantly rejected, it’s pretty compliant in the words being said, hook headline text etc. So I’m not sure if meta doesn’t like the fact it’s fully made with Veo 3 ‎<This message was edited>
[25.08.25, 6:19:08] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Same , the fastest rejection ever hahah
[25.08.25, 6:21:46] ~ Luka: We definitely have. It saves us money and also makes us more money. We saw a difference very quickly. Also, we had a payment to madgicx get rejected (so automation stopped working) and we noticed a decrease in performance because of it ‎<This message was edited>
[25.08.25, 6:54:57] ~ Carter Mac: Any way around it?
[25.08.25, 6:55:05] ~ Carter Mac: My competitors are running many of that style
[25.08.25, 7:33:34] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Maybe an agency account, I don’t know
[25.08.25, 10:46:51] ~ Malik: Hey guys quick question please: I run the ONE CBO per product campaign structure and it is working wonderful. But I heard that META doesn't like when we have too many live adsets (Max 70). Is it true ? And if any of you guys does the same structure how do you optimize it ? Thx
[25.08.25, 10:52:13] Matán Intsuper: Live adsets in general or in the cbo?
[25.08.25, 10:53:16] ~ Malik: In the CBO
[25.08.25, 11:20:26] Matán Intsuper: i do 5-10 max
[25.08.25, 11:20:40] Matán Intsuper: i think its just not efficient to have 70 in the cbo

[25.08.25, 13:12:55] ~ Ислам: Has anyone tried listing your products on a website like clickbank ? Does it work ?
[25.08.25, 13:34:45] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, have you seen static ads work effectively at TOF/unaware audiences, or are they generally picked up by Facebook mainly for retargeting? In our account, statics end up with a frequency of 2–3, even when we design them for unaware markets.

How would you approach testing or optimizing them for TOF? If we can crack this, we can explore new angles and segments for our product without video ads.
[25.08.25, 14:04:08] ~ Jake: For everyone selling worldwide 

Is there any solution to have the post purchase flow show for all markets. Since it is only showing for US customers at the moment which are checking out in the stores main currency.
[25.08.25, 14:08:59] ~ JULIUS: Why not just exclude existing buyers / traffic if you want to test TOF/unaware audiences with static ads?
[25.08.25, 14:09:21] ~ JULIUS: If I'm not mistaken it's a limitation from Shopify, the only work around solution would be to just external Shopify checkout
‎[25.08.25, 14:10:05] ~ JULIUS: ‎image omitted
[25.08.25, 14:10:49] Carlos Leeseman: Yes we can exclude existing buyers and engaged customers, but then it’s still spending most of budget to people who have engaged with our VSLs
[25.08.25, 14:15:18] ~ JULIUS: You also can exclude video views
[25.08.25, 14:15:20] ~ David B: Hey guys. The copy call is on tomorrow. 10am est, 3pm UK time. 

We're talking about ad interations. How to do it right, what things to change and what strategies are working right now. 

Join me tomorrow and ask your copy questions too! 

See you there!
[25.08.25, 14:16:51] Carlos Leeseman: You’re right, ok that can be interesting.

However I’m wondering in general if TOF statics work for people
[25.08.25, 14:17:17] ~ Jeremy: I think I had this happen before - I had to relauch the campaign (duplicate). Did you check business support home for anny account/ ad issues?
[25.08.25, 14:17:31] ~ JULIUS: There are brands killing it with only static ads, however most of them redirect to advertorial / special LP
[25.08.25, 14:17:45] ~ Jeremy: No
[25.08.25, 14:19:03] ~ Jeremy: Wow, need to implement this ASAP then. Thanks for sharing the sauce!

I am looking for a tool for marketing performance tracking 

Any one knows a tool ?
[25.08.25, 20:28:52] ~ Austin: How do you guys get the transcription from FB ads? I use foreplay, but that takes hours sometimes and I need the transcript now.
[25.08.25, 20:29:22] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Use gethooked best one ever

[25.08.25, 20:49:45] ~ Ислам: As far as I know, when shopify deactivates stores , it may be because some illegal activities, like selling inauthentic items ,
[25.08.25, 20:51:39] ~ Santiago: yep but we totally legit
[25.08.25, 20:58:11] ~ Jake Hagerty: Yeah this could be due to a numerous amount of things but at the end of the day we just need to prove to Shopify that the business is in order and operates compliantly

[25.08.25, 23:43:52] Matán Intsuper: Yes but it will go into processing and learning
[25.08.25, 23:44:11] Matán Intsuper: Otherwise you can try to redirect the live url to another url
[25.08.25, 23:51:25] ~ 🥇: do you mean by creating new ads or modifying same ads

The thing to remember with this guy is that he has a very large following of people who are practically his disciples. He provides his own credibility as an "expert". 

So the question needs to be asked, are people buying for the product or buying because he's the one recommending it? 

Just some food for thought.

[26.08.25, 15:46:55] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Hey guys, shrine has recently released a new version of the pro theme and I wanted to use it because they added the free gift/upsell Box under the quantity brake options so I don’t have to use catching bundles anymore. The problem is that the font of the text is a bit different and also the bold is not a real bold is more like a medium one. Do you think it could be a problem in terms of cvr or it doesn’t really matter? ‎<This message was edited>

[26.08.25, 16:34:56] ~ Rui Bessa: Hey everyone 👋,
I’m running into an issue with SMS consent on Shopify checkout. Currently, my opt-in box says:
“Get 15% off your next order + shipping updates via SMS”
The problem is: near zero customers tick the box, and Shopify doesn’t allow me to have it pre-ticked (compliance reasons).
Has anyone found good ways to increase SMS consent rates?
	•	Should I rely more on post-purchase pop-ups or dedicated email flows to collect SMS separately?
	•	Or is there another workaround inside checkout I might be missing?
[26.08.25, 16:41:21] ~ David B: I don't know if this is still the case but the winning micro copy to increase sign ups used to be. 

Email: required for order confirmation*
Phone: required for shipping notifications*

I know a really good CRO guy. I will ask him and see what he recommends. ‎<This message was edited>

The best way I've seen to deal with this is on your post purchase flow. Have an email that explains the benefits of being an SMS customer, getting deals earlier, SMS exclusives, never missing something because it's buried in an inbox and also be super clear about the frequency. EG we only send 4-6 SMS per month...

[27.08.25, 13:12:46] ~ David B: You are right. There is not a way to auto-subscribe people to sms marketing. It's GDPR / compliance thing. People have to opt-in. You can also segregate your list for people who have bought from you more than once and recommend they opt-in to SMS marketing.
[27.08.25, 13:14:21] ~ Rui Bessa: will do both.. thanks a lot mate!
[27.08.25, 13:16:42] ~ David B: Our SMS customer get early bird access to deals and offers, 
SMS exclusives, 
We only bring you the best deals and offers, 
We don't spam up your phone, we only send 4-6 SMS per month so you don't have to worry. 

Bla bla bla… 

It's about showing them the benefits and removing potential objections in the flows.
[27.08.25, 16:15:31] ~ Matthew Darrel Wood: I sell shipping protection (not here to talk about that)

I obviously have it setup poorly, since in the last two days people started buying ONLY the shipping protection.

I’ve been cancelling the orders as they came in, but is that a sign of a chargeback scam?  Or am I just paranoid?  It’s a 3 dollar upcharge.

[27.08.25, 19:18:19] ~ Zvi: Hello all i was thinking of making 2 voice overs and captions for the same video ad how would you test this in 2 separate ad sets or in the same one? (Its the same video just a different voiceover with different angle)
[27.08.25, 19:26:04] ~ Cocow😈: same adset, let the compete directly and learn from what works best i would say. So you avoid one variable that is the audience that facebook will reach on one adset vs another.
[27.08.25, 19:49:50] ~ Zvi: Tnx
[27.08.25, 21:36:55] ~ Jacob: Guys lately i run new creatives, and after a day facebook writes to me "learning limited" and its profitable
[27.08.25, 21:36:58] ~ Jacob: Should i ignore it?
[27.08.25, 21:37:17] ~ Jacob: And its like spent 50/100$
[27.08.25, 21:37:20] ~ Jacob: Nothing
[27.08.25, 21:37:42] ~ Jacob: Usually it took weeks until ot show this message
[27.08.25, 21:45:48] ~ Barnabás: Yes, that’s normal. ‘Learning limited’ just means the ad hasn’t gathered enough conversions yet for Facebook to fully optimize. To get out of it you usually need to spend more or hit a certain number of conversions. If it’s already profitable, don’t worry too much, it’s just a matter of time and budget.

In case of defective products thay arrive to the customer and needs replacement. Who is responsible for this : supplier or brand owner ? How this is usually managed netween us and the suppliers ?
[28.08.25, 17:50:04] ~ Hunter Davenport: We usually text our supplier and they send a replacement free of charge. But they require proof. So the customer needs to send a video or image to show it’s actually defective
[28.08.25, 22:09:08] ~ Ömer Karakullukçu: Hey guys, are you also focusing organic side? Or only paid ads?

Right now i am only focusing paid ads and i get followers.

[29.08.25, 3:49:04] ~ Steph: Hey @⁨~Ömer Karakullukçu⁩ 
Definitely worth posting + sharing stories. They work in synergy, ads bring in the followers, and when people click through and see organic posts, it instantly builds more credibility and trust.

A hack is setting up a simple email flow after someone orders, asking for a review or UGC in exchange for a discount/gift. That content can then be reused in your stories for organic AND plugged back into your ads. So you’re basically feeding both sides at once..

[30.08.25, 19:11:43] ~ Austin: ALSO - Send a labor day sale Email and SMS blast to your list, promoting some special offer for the weekend holiday, all we did was mark up the price by 36% and call it 36% off sale. Our sales are up 102% today and it's only noon. It's only Saturday and this is "Labor Day Weekend" you guys can still capitalize on this. Would suggest to double down on it as we speak if you sell US.
[30.08.25, 19:13:59] ~ Austin: How do you guys surf scale? Do you just double budget every hour? Will it mess anything up? Would love to know.

I would like to try to target just US, when there is highest ROAS. Should I just duplicate my campaigns with current budgets (f.e. my scaling CBO has $1.3k day spend) or build them again from the ground up? Also, won't it overlap when I will be running two separate campaigns targeting US with the same ads? Thanks! 🙏

[31.08.25, 23:53:35] ~ Cocow😈: Followers = You don’t care 🤣

Yes you can launch one ad from page doctor on Facebook and same ad on your brand page on Instagram if you want 

But just go third party page everywhere and you are good
[31.08.25, 23:55:13] ~ F: now our main fb page reached the limit. we can create a new fb page, and launch new ads on that second fb page, and also connect it to our main ig account?
[31.08.25, 23:55:30] ~ F: I thought you could only connect the IG acc to 1 fb page
[1.09.25, 0:03:36] ~ Cocow😈: You do not need to connect them
[1.09.25, 0:03:42] ~ Cocow😈: Connect them this is for positing
[1.09.25, 0:04:16] ~ Cocow😈: Not for ads. Just try and you will see :) 

Maybe as well just worth cutting ads that are not spending 🤣

[3.09.25, 12:57:42] ~ Cocow😈: You can create them with GPT or even GEMINI. Then, send to someone that can do presentations with CANVA and you have it 🙂
[3.09.25, 13:23:16] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Yes but I think there is a platform or a market place for thisbtype of products. They are more elaborate than a simple canvas presentation. I looked it up but doesn't seem fmto be found
[3.09.25, 13:42:09] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Omg @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩ sorry Patrick hadn’t responded. I’ll respond right away at the airport.
[3.09.25, 13:42:38] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): We can get you AMEX and Discover but it’s a different enrollment process. Just DM me and I’ll get u set up
[3.09.25, 13:43:52] ~ Cocow😈: Yes maybe but if you want to test an offer to see if works, then it can be fast and not that expensive. If works well and you want to step up maybe you can find alternatives hehe

Someone who already has a good track record of whats working and whats not. Someone who can come up with small ideas for the script variations on his own would be great.
[3.09.25, 19:59:10] ~ Jeremy: Possible but unlikely, I think it might be related to the meta algorithm update. Or our latest few VSLs just suck 😅
[3.09.25, 20:13:32] ~ Jacob: Did ur vsls were very similar to the older ones u did or compeletley different concepts?
[3.09.25, 20:14:11] ~ Jeremy: Similar, mainly iterations of winners + a few new ones
[3.09.25, 20:16:33] ~ Jacob: From like 5/7 youtube videos i saw lately, the recomendation was that every creative should be very different, the reason for that is andromeda algo update that dont like iterations, and the reason for that is a lot of ai similar content, and thats their way to try to keep content diversity for the audience ‎<This message was edited>
[3.09.25, 20:19:01] ~ Jacob: The recomendation was 15 completely new ads each month (if u can more so more of course) but that was the sweep spot
[3.09.25, 20:25:49] ~ Jeremy: Thanks for the advice, will test this 🙏🏼
[3.09.25, 20:28:12] ~ Jeremy: So would you then test a new VSL with only one hook? How can you be confident that you chose the right hook? 🤔

[3.09.25, 20:35:06] ~ Jacob: The messaging can be similar with different words and different visuals, its not contradics it, and also, did u try to change the angle of the presell? Maybe you have angle fatigue of the current funnel ‎<This message was edited>

I am marketing my best seller with different angles which none of them are healthy related. I would like to introduce the health angle the creatives, will this flag my account as a health  account therefore CPMs goes up3📈📈 ‎<This message was edited>
[3.09.25, 21:03:23] ~ Cocow😈: The problem of health is more linked to domain and website. 

CPMs going higher is shit , but worse is being flagged and losing the events of your pixel haha
[3.09.25, 21:04:31] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: You mean your pixel will not work properly in case it is flagged ?
[3.09.25, 21:05:52] ~ Cocow😈: It may happend that your purchase event get flagged and cannot be used anymore cause meta will cut it 

So if I were you avoid it if you can and launche for example a funnel on funnelish with new domain
[3.09.25, 21:08:47] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Right now CPMs are pretty low so no worries if flagging comes from website

[4.09.25, 17:30:55] ~ Allen David Shor: Hey, 

I want to test the demand for a digital product before creating the actual product. 

What in your experience is the best way to do this?

Option 1: Run ads to the sales page as if the product existed and then offer a refund or offer a 50% refund if they wait for the launch. If I hit 5-10 sales at an acceptable CPA, create the product.

Option 2: Sell the product as a "preorder" (this I believe could drive down conversion rates as cold traffic does not tend to preorder). 

Option 3: Any other approach?
[4.09.25, 17:36:20] Matán Intsuper: You can try both
[4.09.25, 17:36:36] Matán Intsuper: One time preorder for physical product worked better for me than normal
[4.09.25, 17:41:27] ~ Allen David Shor: And you were offering the same price?
[4.09.25, 17:41:29] ~ Allen David Shor: Thanks!
[4.09.25, 17:41:37] Matán Intsuper: Yes
[4.09.25, 17:42:49] ~ Allen David Shor: Got it. And how likely is it to run into trouble with payment processors if I use option #1 and just offer refunds? I use Stripe.
[4.09.25, 17:46:51] Matán Intsuper: Funny enough, most people didn’t want refund and agreed to wait
[4.09.25, 17:47:20] Matán Intsuper: If a big % of your orders will be a refund, it’s a problem
‎[4.09.25, 17:51:26] Matán Intsuper: ‎image omitted
[4.09.25, 17:55:44] ~ Allen David Shor: Interesting. I will try both options.
[4.09.25, 17:57:06] ~ Jacob: I had like 5/6 digital products, i always tested vsl first and than create the product , without refund, i just did it in one day , just something to take into consideration with digital products is that refund rates are higher and u need to choose the right payment procesor ‎<This message was edited>
[4.09.25, 17:57:08] ~ Erik: At least they have your attention😅👍🏼
[4.09.25, 17:58:41] ~ Allen David Shor: Which processor would you recommend?
[4.09.25, 17:59:05] ~ Jacob: And the customer service is horrible at digital products to lol
[4.09.25, 17:59:19] ~ Jacob: People execpt a lot from this usually
[4.09.25, 17:59:27] ~ Jacob: So need to be careful with promises
[4.09.25, 17:59:50] ~ Jacob: I worked localy back than, so it wasnt nothing international
[4.09.25, 18:00:12] ~ Jacob: And they didnt care about disputes to much
[4.09.25, 18:00:48] ~ Jacob: Search for payment procesors for digital products
[4.09.25, 18:02:04] ~ Erik: Maybe you could tackle that a bit by giving discount code, free gift or something like that after purchase..
[4.09.25, 18:02:35] ~ Allen David Shor: Got it, thanks @⁨~Jacob⁩
[4.09.25, 18:03:20] ~ Jacob: And personaly if your going to a competitive market i suggest youll have a strong backend funnel or some subcription model or unique marketing startegy that its very cheap otherwise it will be very tough ‎<This message was edited>
[4.09.25, 18:05:03] ~ John B: damn they ripped my winning ad
[4.09.25, 18:05:06] ~ Allen David Shor: Yes, the idea would be to test a front end product, if it works then develop front end + backend.
[4.09.25, 18:16:26] ~ Jacob: I would check digistore24, its an affiliate network that also provide payment processing, they are not cheap but there are some little scammy offers there so they know the deal with disputes and also you can recruit affilates to promote your offer and if its succesful it can run for a lot of time with affiliates
[4.09.25, 18:16:59] ~ Jacob: I worked with them as a vendor and affiliate and they reliable
[4.09.25, 18:18:02] ~ Jacob: I answered to this
[4.09.25, 20:24:00] ~ 👀: ‎~ Salma Jimenez added ~ 👀
[4.09.25, 20:30:44] ~ John B: How do you guys balance running ads on different ad accounts - possibly even BMs to mitigate risk of a ban in the middle of scaling? We plan to scale far beyond we ever have this Q4 and I’d like to have ads running on different accounts so everything doesn’t just go to 0 if we get banned but i’m curious how you guys spread out your ads in this way.
[4.09.25, 20:33:51] Matán Intsuper: Maybe try agency account instead and try to differentiate audience between the accounts in order not to compete with urself
[4.09.25, 20:34:35] ~ John B: makes sense. thanks bro.
[4.09.25, 20:55:07] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I had people wait for my physical product for 2 months

I think for digital products it is easier because there is more shipping and production time is substantially shorter. I think you can literally start running ads without even having the digital product.

At the end, digital products can a bit difficult to have them preordered because why they should wait ? (Customer thought)
[4.09.25, 20:56:41] ~ Allen David Shor: Yeah makes sense. I’ll just start running ads .
[4.09.25, 21:31:04] ~ Ислам: Mine the same situation, but with physical product, so if it is like , on my website it says two day shipping, but after they place order i will get back to them and inform we are running our of stock, could you wait or want refund, 

So is it ok, what do you think?
[4.09.25, 21:31:50] ~ Jeremy: Option 1
[4.09.25, 21:34:05] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: ‎This message was deleted.
[4.09.25, 21:34:21] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: No, be open with them right away and very clear. That said, your offer need to be attractive and worth waiting for. If you are selling a product that everyone is selling, preorder in this case will not work very well. You need to have uniqness in your product and you customers will wait for a 6 months easy.
[4.09.25, 21:37:35] ~ Ислам: Yes, my product is unique, so that being said, it should sound like preorder, right? I'm afraid it can decrease conversion, and I don't understand real demand
[4.09.25, 21:39:33] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Don't worry about conversion in the begenning, focus on profitability, if you are profitable then all is good. Preorders are temporary. Watch your profit on a daily basis

Willing to pay a developer to fix those for me, but I don’t know anyone who has experience with fixing those issues.. Funnelish isn’t willing to help. We don’t want to change a platform at the moment, we prefer to fix those issues.

Any ideas?
[7.09.25, 7:58:49] Malachi: I had an issue with it adding items that customers didn’t click to add, and had somebody recommend to me to double check that there aren’t two “checkout sections” or “button.” Sometimes it gets duplicated because you have one for mobile and one for desktop, but that can lead to double orders. So I would take a quick look at that just to make sure

[7.09.25, 14:48:51] ~ Arin: Check if your site is being indexed by google. You can do this by typing the following into the address bar:

site:myurl.com

If you get results, Google has indexed your site. Then you will need some SEO to increase the ranking.

if not indexed, first thing you will need to do is to submit a sitemap to google. May take a few weeks/months. 

If your social channels that are on google have links to your website, I would imaging Google already indexing your site.

[8.09.25, 12:26:34] ~ Rui Bessa: hE GUYS, I own a US LLC (I’m European, the sole owner). I opened a PayPal account for it about a year ago but only just started using it last week. To test it, I made a $0.99 purchase from another personal PayPal account (not linked to me).

Right after that, PayPal asked me to verify my identity. The only options were a US ID or US driver’s license. I uploaded my European passport, and after review they shut the account down.

Even worse — both my LLC PayPal and the personal PayPal that made the test purchase got permanently blocked.

A couple questions:
	•	Can I try to open another PayPal under the same LLC, or is that impossible once it’s flagged?
	•	Is there any legit way for a European owner of a US LLC to have a US PayPal account without running into this issue?
[8.09.25, 12:27:53] ~ Jeremy Leppink: @⁨~Avv. Isidoro Capuano⁩ might be able to at least get your old account back @⁨~Rui Bessa⁩
[8.09.25, 15:18:12] ~ Mercédesz Lajos: Yes we tried it, didn’t work. But also we were running different offers for the same store. It seemed like as if they were competing against each other.
[8.09.25, 15:19:51] ~ Adam K.: Yes, I can confirm, as we turned off all campaigns on one acc, other got better results.
[8.09.25, 15:24:27] Carlos Leeseman: Yes one ad account works better for optimizations. Only do multiple ad accounts if you have different markets for example
[8.09.25, 18:41:57] ~ Elad Ezra: There is no google meeting today guys?
[8.09.25, 20:13:36] ~ .: ‎~ Barby removed ~ .
[8.09.25, 19:01:13] ~ JB: Looking for a customer support group.  Any recommendations are appreciated
[8.09.25, 19:13:07] ~ Vasile: hey Elad, I usually start these meetings at the time indicated in skool. If nobody joins, I cancel the call after 5 minutes. This is what happened today. Feel free to DM your questions.
[8.09.25, 19:15:08] ~ Elad Ezra: Ohh got you, thanks i will 🙏🏼
[8.09.25, 19:17:05] ~ Austin: Does anyone know how to integrate wetracked with checkout champ?
[8.09.25, 20:29:38] ~ Manuel Fernandez: ‎~ Barby removed ~ Manuel Fernandez
[8.09.25, 20:44:06] ~ Mohammed-amine: Anyone got a plug at Applovin? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.09.25, 21:53:26] ~ F: whats up everyone. we want to start a supplement brand. what supplier are you all using or what do you recommend? we are new on the space but have large experience in ecommerce in general
[8.09.25, 22:30:03] ~ Allan L: Anyone else had issues uploading new videos to facebook today?

Tried for the whole day but keep getting the error after processing the videos that I should try again later, pretty much just processing for every and then saying "Upload failed"
[8.09.25, 23:08:52] ~ David B: Hey all. I'm back from Affiliate World and ready for our next copy call. 

Tomorrow (Tuesday) at 10am EST, 3pm UK time, I'll show you how to 3, 5, 10X your conversion rates by tapping into the 8 core desires of human emotion.

Not to be missed.

[9.09.25, 6:46:20] ~ seth: Does this affect your meta ads performance?
[9.09.25, 7:11:44] ~ Eliezer Blas: No, but it is important to be careful with these. Too many can ban your ad account
‎[9.09.25, 10:20:43] ~ Allan L: ‎image omitted
[9.09.25, 10:21:51] Matán Intsuper: Try a different browser / account
[9.09.25, 10:22:15] Matán Intsuper: Sounds like a glitch that isn’t everywhere so might be something in ur account/user/computer/browser
[9.09.25, 10:23:01] ~ Allan L: hmm could be. Happens more than often, not gonna lie.
Normally its gone  after a hour or two, but yea, this time its been staying like this.

Will try one of the backup accounts
[9.09.25, 10:23:13] ~ Allen David Shor: Yeah, seems like a bug. Did you try resetting your ad account?
[9.09.25, 10:23:33] ~ Allen David Shor: Are you uploading them manually or API?
[9.09.25, 10:23:51] ~ Allan L: What do you mean by resetting?
Its a old personal ad account on my business manager with a credit line etc.

Not a new ad account that I can just reset
[9.09.25, 10:24:03] ~ Allan L: Uploading manualle

[9.09.25, 15:07:47] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah same, looks like it’s postponed
[9.09.25, 15:08:51] ~ L: Guys do you know any GOOD app/software for SRTs?
[9.09.25, 16:38:36] ~ David B: Hey all, The copy call is on in 20 minutes! 

Get insights into the emotional hacks that turn browsers into buyers. 

No cap.
[9.09.25, 16:46:51] ~ Austin: Hey guys use Campaigns.io for all FB ad launches....SOOOOO MUCH FASTER and more reliable.....GAME CHANGER software
[9.09.25, 16:58:35] ~ David B: https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BIh2d3fMT8upuW35q_8fxQ
[9.09.25, 17:27:21] ~ Allan L: What is this? Uro doesnt work but sounds interesting
[9.09.25, 17:28:46] ~ Austin: It allows you to launch hundreds of ads in a matter of minutes....you upload a folder and it automatically sets up the ad sets and ads....the controls are a bit basic but they have never lead to a glitch.
[9.09.25, 17:28:47] ~ Austin: https://quickcampaigns.io/main
[9.09.25, 17:29:08] ~ Austin: Here's their site, the videos do a good job explaining everything
[9.09.25, 17:29:34] ~ Austin: My FB ad launch time has dropped by probably 80% using that software
[9.09.25, 17:29:54] ~ Austin: It's like $100 a month, and there's a free trial to check out
[9.09.25, 17:30:37] ~ Allan L: Thanks bro! Will have a look at it 👌 but their comparisons seems bit crazy, haha. 90 minutes to set up adsets
[9.09.25, 17:32:06] ~ Austin: Yeah, maybe a bit of an over shot, but when uploading 10-20 VSL's that's about right with how slow my account is
[9.09.25, 18:03:41] ~ David B: Thanks to everyone who attended the call today. Really good turnout and a ton of value (Hopefully!)

Here is the link to the presentation for anyone interested. https://www.canva.com/design/DAGyd838YPg/PUmeDFpMs8-ilWUT5n7q6A/edit
[9.09.25, 18:04:02] ~ David B: And for those of you who were there live, enjoy the freebie and let me know how you get on with it! ‎<This message was edited>
[9.09.25, 19:16:15] ~ Cocow😈: Agree on this app, huge banger. Helped us a lot.
[9.09.25, 20:41:29] ~ Austin: Yeah man banger app
[9.09.25, 22:38:14] ~ .: ‎~ Salma Jimenez added ~ .
[10.09.25, 3:14:05] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Hi, I want to start an influencer marketing campaign. 

The agreement I want to have with the influencer is 

Gifted product + affiliate link for commissions 


Is this something that they are used to and working with this formulas ? If no then what is the best formulas ? (I do not want to pay for a social media post)
[10.09.25, 4:21:46] ~ Austin: How much of a difference does native ads make for those who are running them?
[10.09.25, 4:24:38] China Bigboss: Hey bro yes work with micro influencers for sure and depends on your affiliate system and how much you are able to leave
[10.09.25, 4:26:02] ~ Austin: Yes they 100% know this formula and many small creators will be happy to do it. For them it's an honor a company gives them monetization opportunity, many of them think a "Brand Deal" is the only way to monetize their channels / pages. Position this as a brand deal, something important to their pockets and the wellbeing to their audience.
[10.09.25, 4:27:20] ~ Austin: Be VERY specific in what you want with examples and scripts if your looking for something specific. Also mention that you will run their content in ads, so their aware of this, maybe point it out as they get more recognition / reach.
[10.09.25, 4:28:07] ~ Austin: Personally we get people reaching out wanting to try the product like crazy, ask your customer service agent to record the email / contact info of who ever reaches out....easy win
[10.09.25, 9:36:06] ~ Cocow😈: Running sinces 4 months , we are finding hard times to make it work 🤣 but once you find the secret sauce I think this is a fucking mess after cause the process of creatives is soooo simple. However , the media buying is a bit shitty but we had someone doing it
[10.09.25, 16:05:32] ~ Mikael: Hey. When Klarna complain about "fake reviews" on site. How strict are they with this? Anyone encountered this issue? (Shopify Payments Klarna)
[10.09.25, 17:47:18] ~ RS: Hey! Guys who use funnelish, what meta tracking software do you use? I use wetracked but it counts every upsell as seperate purchase in FB so it always shows much lower CPA than it is actually.
[10.09.25, 21:34:34] ~ Austin: Guys I went over to checkout champ and it is a MASSIVE upgrade from Funnelish in my opinion….funnelish took us 2-3X longer to get on and even after weeks of fixing various issues we never got close to Shopify performance or reliability….champ has been live now for 3 days and since the very first sale it’s been deadly accurate and functional….exact same CR as Shopify as we still use Shopify as our front end so meta continues to give great CPM, then once the customer goes to checkout it looks identical and loads faster but is indeed actually checkout champ….weve done very minimal changed to upsell layouts and just from platform shift and tweaks we’ve seen between 12-15% AOV boost on average….extra $1,800 - 2,400 profit per day from that one swing…would highly recommend. ‎<This message was edited>
[10.09.25, 21:34:48] ~ Austin: We paired champ with wetracked software by the way
[10.09.25, 21:35:43] ~ Austin: Oh and champ gives you a direct slack channel with a personal support rep that gets on calls and can seriously speed up the onboarding process
[10.09.25, 21:36:37] ~ Austin: We got on 2 calls with him and another call with wetracked support and in 5 buisness days we got it rolling
[10.09.25, 21:36:58] ~ JP Perera: How does this compare to to Madicx?
[10.09.25, 21:38:01] ~ Austin: I can’t even begin to list out how awful and problematic Funnelish was from day 1-100, personally I would recommend 100% champ over Funnelish based of my experience
[10.09.25, 21:38:48] ~ JP Perera: Klarna bothered to complain about reviews? How?
[10.09.25, 21:41:13] ~ Austin: Also another great test we’ve seen great results in is offering the product in different colors…I want to say it was around 18% RPV increase by adding a “premium” color or finish
[10.09.25, 21:41:48] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Me too. They sent an email asking me to remove unverified reviews. They gave me around one week to do it ‎<This message was edited>
[10.09.25, 21:42:09] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Actually they sent to Stripe, and Stripe told me
[10.09.25, 21:48:26] ~ Austin: Feel free to DM about anything mentioned, it was quite the learning curve for me, happy to share
[10.09.25, 21:51:53] ~ Jacob: So if the changes are so minimal than how it look on shopify so whats the difference?
[10.09.25, 23:03:45] ~ Farhat Godil: Is there some app for customer service automation?
[10.09.25, 23:04:54] ~ Bony Ghadiya: Brandwise.ai ‎<This message was edited>
‎[11.09.25, 0:28:12] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: ‎image omitted
[11.09.25, 0:33:11] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Yes won one before with the same circumstances. Reach out to the customer even after placing the charge back trying to clarify the problem with them, in case they do not respond after a certain amount of time take that email and put together with your return policy, your screen shot of the order date, and email and every information about the order and send your file to the payment processor. Be transparent and have everything with an evidence, you should be ok
[11.09.25, 4:15:11] Fabian: Hey guys we’re trying to scale with Impact.com, and would like your views on getting valuable affiliate partners (mostly looking at networks). 
Ideally targeting top of funnel.

Do you have recommendations? And/or anyone open to having a deep convo about affiliate networks?
[11.09.25, 4:57:34] ~ Eliezer Blas: Are we allowed to send our advertorials on here for feedback? ‎<This message was edited>
[11.09.25, 5:07:34] ~ Austin: Yes
[11.09.25, 5:08:17] ~ Austin: But I would send them to a specific coach
[11.09.25, 5:08:32] ~ Eliezer Blas: Gotcha. Sounds good. Thanks
[11.09.25, 6:37:25] ~ Moh: Hi Ess, I’m exploring the subscription option for our products, but I’ve run into a concern. If a customer subscribes and purchases a product at the discounted subscription rate, then cancels shortly after, they’ll have essentially bought a single unit at a lower price. This would negatively impact our margins and overall profitability.
What would you recommend in this case? Should I reconsider the subscription model altogether and instead focus on offering product bundles as an alternative?
[11.09.25, 7:07:57] Matán Intsuper: It’s part of the business
[11.09.25, 7:08:34] ~ Mikael: Dont know. We did not missuse reviews. There were only 3 small AI reviews below the ATC button... lol ‎<This message was edited>
[11.09.25, 7:08:49] ~ Eliezer Blas: Yo, whoever can give me some honest feedback on my advertorial, I’d greatly appreciate it 💯. Thanks in advance. https://nuevocore.co/pages/top-four-hidden-illnesses-vaping-can-trigger?_pos=1&_psq=top&_ss=e&_v=1.0
[11.09.25, 7:11:23] ~ Eliezer Blas: It’s optamized for phone aspect btw ☝️
[11.09.25, 9:51:31] ~ Steph: Hi ESS,
Wanted to share this case study coming into Q4. It is ludicrous that over 80% of eCom brands run only on Meta. The ones who add Google unlock massive growth.
We took a brand from $0 → $11M in 5 months, all on Google cold traffic.

[11.09.25, 9:56:01] ~ danny smith: thanks steph🙏
[11.09.25, 11:15:00] ~ Adam K.: Hi guys – have you ever had any bad experiences boosting Instagram posts? 
I’m a bit worried it might mess up our ads pixel. But obviously, brands must have a way of handling this… or should I just not worry and go ahead boosting posts with influencers while attaching our pixel?
[11.09.25, 15:29:42] ~ Jake: Hi legends!

I am looking to implement subscriptions for or brand!

Any app / software recommendations?

Does anyone have some resources on this topic? 

Would love to see some data!

Just let me know
[11.09.25, 15:31:13] ~ Musawer: Dm me brother
[11.09.25, 17:03:11] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Is there a reason you are using black background and white text? I’m asking because it’s usually harder to read it for people ‎<This message was edited>

[11.09.25, 17:36:57] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey guys. Can you please recommend the best service for buying TrustPilot reviews?
[11.09.25, 17:58:00] ~ Barnabás: Hello Gs, if im building a quiz funnel should i put the facebook pixel in to heyflow or i can just put it in to shopify?
[11.09.25, 18:40:12] ~ Pawan : ‎~ Salma Jimenez added ~ Pawan 
[11.09.25, 19:43:04] ~ Farhat Godil: Any recommendations for someone who is expert at creating amazon listings?
[11.09.25, 19:45:39] ~ Farhat Godil: Also need recommendation for IP lawyer to file trademark
[11.09.25, 19:57:59] ~ L: Guys, question for everyone.

i was talking with a friend yesterday, we both sell in the US. 

While I’ve always gone after big niches like neck pain, knee pain, ankle pain, and so on, he focuses on micro-niches. 

He gets good results thanks to lower competition and a less sophisticated market.

But i was courious to know: where do you stand? Cause I’ve always found small niches to be good for short term brands.

What do you do guys? Are you elbowing your way into big niches, or working in small, untapped markets laughing at folks like me? 😅
[11.09.25, 21:34:06] ~ Eliezer Blas: Yeah I did so because it’s worked before. Do you think a white background would work better?
[11.09.25, 22:09:03] ~ F: Whats up everyone. I have a US LLC as a non citizen and I will go personally to the US. What banks do you guys recommend? Both personal and business
[11.09.25, 22:26:01] ~ Giovanni Restelli: You could test it out
[11.09.25, 22:28:07] ~ Pawan : Which one do you use currently?
‎[11.09.25, 23:35:57] ~ Sonu Duhra: ‎image omitted
[12.09.25, 0:30:31] ~ Allan L: My video editor Got hired fulltime so looking for a new one. 
Anyone Can recommend someone?
[12.09.25, 0:58:04] ~ F: revolut, paypal, wise, mercury, slash. but want to open smth like chase, bank of america, etc. not sure whats the best option
[12.09.25, 1:43:07] ~ Facundo: I know someone in chase, happy to share
[12.09.25, 7:58:43] ~ Pawan : Well chase has very good payment processing offerings and Bank of America is great for scaling businesses as per my knowledge
[12.09.25, 10:11:19] ~ Jakub: I’m in a smaller niche selling digital products and it works well 👍
[12.09.25, 12:01:30] ~ Mikael: Anyone paying Facebook Invoicing from a different company than registered on the BM? Does it work?
[12.09.25, 14:35:42] ~ F: do you guys know if it’s fine to have the same pixel connected to:

store 1: pixel connected to triple whale attribution + sonar, running in ads manager 1

store 2: pixel connected to wetracked, running in ads manager 2

wetracked told us there is no problem but I just want to confirm ‎<This message was edited>
[12.09.25, 14:39:19] ~ Cocow😈: we have 2 capi. One for shopify , one for funnelish. Bot same pixel and ads manager. 

SO for me, you are good. Not ideal for sure, but your are fine
[12.09.25, 14:46:12] ~ Austin: You guys 10000% need google
[12.09.25, 14:53:18] ~ Austin: It’s added 30-50% of revenue since month 2 and I just get on a few call a month with my agency
[12.09.25, 14:55:42] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Is it recommended only for brands that already have a certain amount of revenue? Like from 100k a month?

Because I know that at the beginning you lose money and then it starts performing (but I talk as an ignorant)
[12.09.25, 17:23:14] ~ John B: Even at 2-3k days, id say brand search campaigns are very much worth it
[12.09.25, 17:43:42] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah I have that one
[13.09.25, 1:27:43] ~ Malak: ‎‎~ Malak changed their phone number to a new number. ‎Tap to message new number.
[13.09.25, 7:26:10] ~ Moath Adnan: Hello guys, question for people working in the supplements niche, what the best payment gateway for a supplements brand?
[13.09.25, 7:26:43] ~ Moath Adnan: and does anyone have a good recommendation for a financial advisor?
[13.09.25, 7:41:09] ~ Austin: I started google at 160K months and it made a difference there....higher the scale more essential it is
[13.09.25, 7:44:27] ~ Hunter Davenport: How long did it take to make it profitable?
[13.09.25, 7:49:39] ~ RS: Guys who use funnelish+wetracked, is FB tracking your purchases correctly? It stopped tracking anything for me in the last 16 hours. Wetracked says there is something wrong with funnelish.
[13.09.25, 7:51:48] ~ RS: wetracked says other guys are also having the same problem
[13.09.25, 7:51:56] ~ Austin: Month 1 I'm pretty sure
[13.09.25, 7:52:06] ~ RS: @⁨~Y⁩
[13.09.25, 7:52:16] ~ Austin: I use WT and checkout champ....all good
[13.09.25, 7:52:24] ~ Austin: on FB and WT dashboard
[13.09.25, 7:53:05] ~ RS: Funnelish has not responded yet. And we are here with thousands of spend and 0 purchases tracked today lol
[13.09.25, 7:53:10] ~ Austin: Man Funnelish was always some BS issue....we went in for 3-4 months to try and get funnelish to be bug free...always something
[13.09.25, 7:53:38] ~ Austin: Was it tracking and then it stopped?
[13.09.25, 7:54:00] ~ Austin: Do you have "External checkout" switched on in WT?
[13.09.25, 7:54:04] ~ RS: Exactly. Stopped completely tracking purchase events 16h ago
[13.09.25, 7:54:32] ~ Austin: Hmmmmm interesting....does funnelish show conversion value / conversion metrics/
[13.09.25, 7:54:33] ~ RS: Wetracked says that many other guys are having the same issue who use funnelish
[13.09.25, 7:54:34] ~ Austin: ?
[13.09.25, 7:54:58] ~ RS: Yeah all good. Just no any purchase events sent to FB
[13.09.25, 7:55:10] ~ Austin: Ahhhhh now thats wild
[13.09.25, 7:55:18] ~ RS: Yeah man
[13.09.25, 7:55:26] ~ Austin: What about this?
[13.09.25, 7:55:41] ~ Austin: Is it selected? W ehad to select this as we use Chamo checkout
[13.09.25, 7:56:30] ~ RS: I dont know man, i use WT and funnelish for year and a half and it was all ok, so i think there is some major glitch right now
[13.09.25, 7:57:06] Matán Intsuper: We are using Funnelish and converge and no issues
[13.09.25, 7:57:53] ~ Hunter Davenport: Nope it’s always fkd😂 I don’t think ROAS has ever been correct
[13.09.25, 7:59:10] ~ Akshay: How do you guys figure out which creative to scale and which to cut when fb doesn’t report correctly/or even have correct data?
‎[13.09.25, 8:02:04] ~ Austin: ‎image omitted
[13.09.25, 8:02:51] ~ Austin: contact asad@wetracked.io (head of development) or nemanja@wetracked.io head of WT support
[13.09.25, 8:03:13] ~ Austin: Hopefully that helps
[13.09.25, 8:03:24] ~ Hunter Davenport: I’ve just been winging it tbh. My whole campaign has been profitable so I haven’t optimized the ads inside of it. Plus I’m still new to funnelish so daily spend is low so it hasn’t been a big issue yet
[13.09.25, 8:05:09] ~ Austin: Guys if you can try checkout champ....100% hands down my preferred over funnelish....faster set up....way less issues....you get yoru personal slack channel with a rep, that can get on calls and be helpful, or schedule a high level support guy for next day...game changer
[13.09.25, 8:05:12] ~ RS: WT now says they need to confirm with their solutions team if the problem is in funnelish or WT, but their solutions team is outside business hours lol.

[13.09.25, 8:11:58] Matán Intsuper: Checkout champ takes % out of your revenue

[13.09.25, 9:11:54] ~ Ислам: Do you use checkout champ only for checkout page ? Still using shopify for product page ?
[13.09.25, 11:56:03] ~ Rui Bessa: Anyone knows a website or tool to check the top Clickbank VSLs right now? I had one but the link broken
[13.09.25, 13:48:15] ~ Y: Hey everyone! Funnelish haven’t made any updates nor it has any control over how wetracked works, as we don’t have any official integration with it.
This is certainly coming from wetracked itself it cannot be otherwise.
If any of you is facing any issues that are unresolved feel free to reach out to me, happy to help any time.
[13.09.25, 13:51:52] ~ RS: Wetracked told that there were changes in Funnelish API and wetracked API adjustement caused it to break. Issue is now resolved and it was in effect from 12sept 4:26 PM CEST to 13sept 11:15 AM CEST
[13.09.25, 13:52:27] ~ Y: I can assure you that was 100% a lie
[13.09.25, 13:53:16] ~ RS: It seems so, they wanted to blame it all on funnelish. Also, yesterday they told me that they cannot Do anything and its glitch in funnelish, lol
[13.09.25, 13:58:26] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I have seen many people having problems with funnelish,  why are people still use it ?
[13.09.25, 13:59:14] ~ RS: In this case, it was not a problem with funnelish. It was wetracked that fckd up and blamed it on funnelish
[13.09.25, 14:00:00] ~ RS: And i believe it because wetracked support is useless and they are not helpful at all. I have had some issues that i needed help with in wetracked, they never helped.
[13.09.25, 14:02:22] ~ Y: Funnelish doesn’t have a public api to begin with, so any claim it has changed is nonsense.

I suggest asking them to point out the api details, we will be happy to look into it!

[13.09.25, 14:33:40] ~ 🥇: Are you guys still using feedback score services for Facebook, or is it no longer necessary after the recent update? We’ve continued using it, but we notice that every time we send it out, there’s a spike in our metrics for a few days and then it goes back to normal. Could this be related to quality issues? Also, if anyone has a reliable service they’d recommend?
[13.09.25, 14:34:38] ~ Y: Yes it’s in the roadmap
[13.09.25, 15:11:19] ~ Jake: Does someone have a contact to an Airwallex account manager?
[13.09.25, 15:20:43] ~ Jacob: Try to ask for a girl named molly to help you, ive been told a lot of times i have account manager but always it was random people, and eventualy its got to a girl named molly which was the last word
[13.09.25, 15:21:12] ~ Jacob: What u need it for
[13.09.25, 16:12:44] ~ Nicolas: Is there a reason why you guys use Wetracked instead of TripleWhale?
[13.09.25, 16:24:56] ~ Jacob: A lot of people use triplewhale because its shows roas from all the advertising channels
[13.09.25, 16:25:08] ~ Jacob: But the technology is more or less the same
[13.09.25, 16:25:32] ~ Jacob: More data in 1 dashboard
[13.09.25, 16:25:46] ~ Jacob: The wetrack dashboard, no one really use it

[16.09.25, 3:31:47] ~ Steph: Re-marketing is super powerful on Google ads.

One of the main reasons being that you’ll have higher margins than from normal ads - since if they’ve bought from you before they’re more likely to buy again and your CPA will be lower.

Here’s an A-Z guide on remarketing for Google and how you can use it to boost your brands revenue by 20-30% 👇

Mail from our Capi solution: 

There was indeed a temporary drop in event tracking today, due to a broader disruption in the infrastructure that powers a significant part of the internet — including Shopify. Cloudflare has published their incident report here: Cloudflare Incident Report.

Everything is already back to normal, and your tracking is now fully stable again. There's nothing you need to do on your end.

I know how important this data is to you, which is why we’re also strengthening our own systems to minimize the impact of this kind of incident in the future.

Thanks again for your patience and trust — if you'd like me to explain in more detail how this was reflected in your account, I’m happy to walk you through it.

[17.09.25, 16:56:08] ~ Akos: Hey Kim, if you are a UAE tax resident you should be fine transferring to your personal UAE account. If you are no longer a tax resident in UAE (just have a resident visa or something) then it would worth opening a UAE co to avoid the transfer to be a subjected to taxes from your home country. Hope this helps
[17.09.25, 16:58:04] ~ Kim Romanov: I know this. I just want to be sure that bank in Dubai won’t hold my $1-3M transfer if it will be transferred to my personal account in Dubai’s bank

[17.09.25, 16:59:05] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Mashreq?
[17.09.25, 16:59:09] Matán Intsuper: It is recommended to start with low amounts and not all at once, and you can prepare your banker, they might ask for a document upfront
[17.09.25, 17:00:53] ~ Kim Romanov: I don’t have any bank in Dubai right now as I’m just preparing all the documents, visas and Emirates ID. Currently I don’t even understand do I need to open a company in Dubai to transfer money to the companies bank account or can just open personal account and transfer there
[17.09.25, 17:00:57] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Indeed make an appointment at the bank for this. I transferred 100k to my mashreq and they froze my account and gave me 48 hours to submit all kinds of docs (WIO personal did the same once)

[17.09.25, 17:01:56] ~ Kim Romanov: Yes, that was one of the reasons I want to met you ASAP
[17.09.25, 17:05:59] ~ Kim Romanov: It’s not so easy. I have a family with 2 kids. I already moved to Dubai and it’s very expensive experience. It was cheaper for me moving to Florida than here and I don’t want to stay here for 6-12 months and realize that this whole thing with UAE tax residency and transferring money from the US doesn’t work in the future
[17.09.25, 17:07:13] Matán Intsuper: But why do u need to transfer the money? Use your American money wherever u are. That’s what I do without an issue
[17.09.25, 17:07:55] ~ Kim Romanov: And you don’t have any issues with the US banks if you all the time abroad?

[17.09.25, 21:45:05] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Yes definitely you should because sometimes they will go even after your ad account. 
Also if you want to get reviews without taking someones else work you can always send to a couple of creators and make them do an honest review might cost you a couple of hundreds but this approach is much better on the longterm.

[18.09.25, 6:43:18] ~ Nicolas: I had the same happen to me and also talked to support.

They said it will only be within the 1 store. The others should not be affected.
[18.09.25, 6:43:48] ~ Nicolas: Can anyone recommend some good video editors for ads?
[18.09.25, 7:21:39] ~ Eliezer Blas: Thanks brotha
[18.09.25, 10:11:09] ~ seth: Guys my shopify merge paypal into shopify payment after i change my store's Paypal to my US paypal, does anyone have the same issue? And how can i setup paypal as a third-party provider again ?
[18.09.25, 10:12:25] ~ seth: I'm in shopify plus and after check their document it state that all store that have shopify plus plan in US have to use the express paypal that was merge to the shopify payment. This is the new policy i think
[18.09.25, 10:18:09] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: Not sure but so far im using integrated paypal from shopify payment us llc and working great. No reserve, good payout as well
[18.09.25, 10:19:28] ~ seth: how did you manage the dispute rate? mine for paypal is so high and hard to control as customer tend to dispute after send the cancel email in 20mins
[18.09.25, 10:20:26] ~ seth: my shopify payment dispute rate was 0.1% and very healthy but if merge with paypal it may die because paypal have much higher dispute rate
[18.09.25, 10:22:35] ~ Daniel: Instruct your customer service agents to discourage your customers from opening a dispute

We immediately tell customers not to open disputes, we tell then if they open disputes it can take up to 6 weeks for them to get their money back due to our contract with X payment method

If they let us handle it from our side they can get the money back in a couple of days
[18.09.25, 10:23:28] ~ Haitsam Shiddiq Siregar: Inquiry and dispute management is being done through shopify backend
[18.09.25, 10:27:48] ~ seth: for example my customer often open dispute after they was charged with recurring order (we have subscription offer) 
What do you think is the best way to reach out to them and share about what you said ("not to open disputes, we tell then if they open disputes it can take up to 6 weeks..")
[18.09.25, 10:28:31] ~ seth: we setup flow email to sent email before the charge already but they keep missing it
[18.09.25, 10:30:42] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: You need to tell them about it before they make the purchase. Put it upfront very clear, your dispute rate will drop drastically. It seems they do not know about the recurring charge so naturally they open a dispute
[18.09.25, 10:32:28] ~ Daniel: After opening the dispute send them an email explaining the situation in a light way. Tell them you got a notification of them opening a dispute and you’re happy to help 

Of course they can have their money back. But due to the dispute they opened it will take up to 6 weeks. If they close the dispute they will have their money in a couple of days
[18.09.25, 12:28:38] Carlos Leeseman: Hey guys, what strategy are you currently running on Meta right now?

We’ve been using an ABO creative testing campaign combined with a CBO scaling campaign for years already. Like any setup, it has its pros and cons. What we like about it is that every concept gets a fair shot since each ad set has its own daily budget. The downside, of course, is that we’re “wasting” some budget on non-winners, whereas with a single CBO campaign, Facebook often figures that out faster.

At the moment, we’re pushing out 15–20 new concepts per week (which equals 15-20 new ad sets, with 3 variants inside each ad set).

I’m curious if there are any of you testing and scaling with a single CBO campaign? If so, how do you handle that with the same (or even higher) creative output? We’re testing this approach since last week, launched 19 new concepts into one CBO, and 90% of the budget ended up going almost entirely to one ad set, which means 1 concept out of the 19 we’ve launched, what is incredible for me. Some people say that just means the others weren’t winners, but my concern is that we might be missing out on potential winners with this structure.

What are you guys doing?
[18.09.25, 12:36:31] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I’m very interested too 🙏🏻
[18.09.25, 12:37:38] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Btw Would you guys rather hire someone who already knows how to do the job but who is a bit arrogant (and I don’t like him because of that) or someone that is more noob to that position but he’s very willing to learn and put his effort for the brand? 

Basically in the one hand I’m afraid of hiring someone that I don’t like working with but on the other hand I’m afraid of hiring someone who’s making me lose time because he doesn’t know the job 

Thanks guys 🙏🏻
[18.09.25, 12:38:13] Carlos Leeseman: What position?
[18.09.25, 12:41:24] ~ Mukhtar: Never
[18.09.25, 12:42:17] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Any position but in this case VA, because I’ve already failed a couple time with people that were taking too much for things that could have taken many less hours
[18.09.25, 12:42:29] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Never hire someone I don’t like to work with?
[18.09.25, 12:42:48] Carlos Leeseman: For VA definitely experienced person
[18.09.25, 13:03:29] ~ David B: I can recommend a VA she is not the cheapest but she is EXTREMELY good and the best on-page CRO expert I know. She's looking for full time. DM if interested.
[18.09.25, 13:04:33] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Hi, 

I am looking for a good video editor,

 any recommendations ?
[18.09.25, 15:15:53] ~ Jake: I just had 2 ads manager completely disappear out of one of my BM’s

One of them had one campaign live which I just launched this morning.

Now it even says that my ad account creation limit is 1 although I had 3 ad accounts until a couple hours ago.



Anyone had this before?
[18.09.25, 16:14:12] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: How does fb distribute your cbo scaling budget between your winning ads ? Do you see a bias to one ad  ?

[18.09.25, 20:12:39] ~ Jake: When exiting a brand.

How are you guys handling it with all your subscriptions? As they would all get canceled if the buyer would change the payment gateway
[18.09.25, 20:44:13] ~ Casper: Hey everyone, I’m Casper.

I own a natural hair loss brand from the Netherlands. We produce science-backed serums with stem cells + DHT blockers that we produce ourselves. 

Would be dope to connect with other entrepreneurs and share knowledge. I'm based in Canggu, Bali. Send me a DM!

Also, anyone here got experience in finding reliable luxury custom bottle & box manufacturers in Europe / has good contacts?
[18.09.25, 23:19:33] ~ danny smith: when testing do you guys reccomend image ads to a pre lander or straight to pdp?
[18.09.25, 23:23:12] Carlos Leeseman: We see good results statics to TOF. 

If retargeting ads, then PDP or listicle best option
[18.09.25, 23:24:35] ~ danny smith: just working on testing some more products rn and wondering if it’s worth to go straight to pdp and see if it works before testing pre landers. trying to be more time efficient and xp farm
[18.09.25, 23:24:43] Carlos Leeseman: Sorry I mean TOF statics to advertorial haha
[18.09.25, 23:25:01] ~ danny smith: was lil confused haha thanks
[18.09.25, 23:25:42] Carlos Leeseman: Check what the messaging behind your ad is. If it’s unaware/problem aware and needs more explanation for example then advertorials are amzing
[18.09.25, 23:26:18] Carlos Leeseman: Statics are just crushing it at the moment, can recommend it really to everyone. It’s so easy to make in bulk and so many iterations you can do
[18.09.25, 23:27:38] ~ danny smith: yea i’ve been getting good cpc and ctr with statics
[18.09.25, 23:27:58] ~ danny smith: very easy to change the angles/  create your own content without having to get ugc or rip videos
[18.09.25, 23:28:47] Carlos Leeseman: Yes but CTR really says nothing. Our statics with 3% CTR are 9/10 times failing, and we have statics with <1% CTR that are doing ROAS 4/5 lol
[18.09.25, 23:29:04] ~ Jacob: And mof and bof to product page?
‎[18.09.25, 23:29:33] Carlos Leeseman: ‎image omitted
[18.09.25, 23:29:45] ~ Jacob: Do u make adset for each stage of the funnel?
[18.09.25, 23:30:26] Carlos Leeseman: BOF 100% to objection/FAQ advertorial or listicle, or just PDP
[18.09.25, 23:30:35] Carlos Leeseman: MOF variates, both works
[18.09.25, 23:30:58] ~ Jacob: What is pdp?
[18.09.25, 23:31:04] ~ danny smith: product page
[18.09.25, 23:31:09] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: What's HP and LP
[18.09.25, 23:31:14] Carlos Leeseman: To be honest not the best person to ask, we’re testing now different things
[18.09.25, 23:31:22] ~ Jacob: Home page and landing page i guess
[18.09.25, 23:31:34] ~ Jacob: Or no
[18.09.25, 23:31:52] Carlos Leeseman: Hybrid page
[18.09.25, 23:32:33] ~ Jacob: What does it mean?
[18.09.25, 23:32:55] Carlos Leeseman: For example advertorial and sales page combined
[18.09.25, 23:33:20] ~ Jacob: I see
[18.09.25, 23:33:39] ~ Jacob: Intersrting
[18.09.25, 23:36:02] ~ danny smith: what if i’m having trouble targeting to the correct audience ?
[18.09.25, 23:36:17] ~ Jacob: one more question if u have time, just for the sake of the example, if u havee 100 $ how will u divide it in mof, bof, tof or u put all in one in adset and let fb do the work?
[18.09.25, 23:36:20] ~ danny smith: the ads/ primary text are directly to younger audience and i’m getting a bunch of old people
[18.09.25, 23:36:44] ~ Jacob: Audience setting
[18.09.25, 23:37:02] ~ Jacob: Do u use advntage plus audience?
[18.09.25, 23:37:18] ~ Jacob: Because advntage plus does not really care he tries all
[18.09.25, 23:38:17] ~ Jacob: When choosing audience there is a text "narrow your ad reach" (🤣)
[18.09.25, 23:38:35] ~ Jacob: Meta frame it so it will sound horrible
[18.09.25, 23:39:18] ~ Jacob: You click on it and than u choose the audience and make sure u uncheck "use it a suggestion" when choosing gender and ages
[18.09.25, 23:39:33] ~ danny smith: tried that also and didn’t work
[18.09.25, 23:39:42] ~ Jacob: Reallt
[18.09.25, 23:39:44] ~ Jacob: Really
[18.09.25, 23:39:48] ~ danny smith: yea it’s pretty annoying
[18.09.25, 23:39:58] ~ danny smith: 3 days in a row trying to target younger audience lol
[19.09.25, 0:59:12] ~ Giovanni Restelli: What is the best iteration you’ve seen working on images? I’ve mainly had success with testing new copys
[19.09.25, 1:08:47] ~ Cocow😈: Hello everyone, with checkout champ are u sing as well vidalytics for VSLs ? Or would you recommend something else ? Thanks a lot
[19.09.25, 1:14:20] Malachi: ^^
[19.09.25, 1:18:45] ~ Colby: Do yall think it’s better to go with capsules or powder blend for supplements.
[19.09.25, 1:43:40] Alex  Fedotoff: @⁨~Matthew Martorano⁩
[19.09.25, 1:50:08] ~ Matthew Martorano: We have guys running VSLs, surveys and quizzes on checkout champ.
[19.09.25, 1:59:45] ~ Cocow😈: Do you host VSLs directly or we have to use a third party app like Vidalytocs or any other you would recommend ?

[19.09.25, 11:49:11] ~ Casper: Hey Guys, QQ. Im running META Ads with a CBO campaign. Fridays are always terrible for me in terms of ROAS, so I'd like to not have active campaigns during that day. My strategy is to simply turn off the campaigns manually every Friday morning. Is this recommended? Or does it destroy 'learning'
[19.09.25, 12:03:00] Matán Intsuper: Doesn’t sound like a good idea but try it. You can also set in the campaigns dates not to run
[19.09.25, 12:03:03] Matán Intsuper: Or use rules
[19.09.25, 12:11:52] ~ Casper: Yeah this doesn't really work for CBO (I believe)
[19.09.25, 12:12:04] ~ Casper: Smart, ill try that. Thanks man!
[19.09.25, 13:26:25] ~ Marko: You can test yourself. Make 2 campaigns. One ABO, one CBO both with the same tests. If CBO spends everything on one ad set but ABO shows another ad set is actually also or more profitable then meta is fucking up. But maybe they’re right. One way to find out I guess
[19.09.25, 16:25:14] ~ Rui Bessa: we use different structures in different ad accounts. Our usual is test in ABO, scale in ABO or CBO…But we recently started a new ad account testing in CBO(1-3-3) same concept with 3 hooks in all 3 adsets with same audience, and creatives that havent performed in abo before, start performing in this strurcture. Thats 1 CBO per concept, and its been easier to scale vertically.. At the end of the day it comes to always try different approaches while  not compromising your current one , so test different structures in different adaccounts not the in the one thats already working..
[19.09.25, 20:59:01] ~ Henry: ‎‎~ Henry changed their phone number to a new number. ‎Tap to message new number.
[19.09.25, 21:29:07] ~ Adam K.: just to clarify:
In CBO you have 3 x same adset with H1,H2,H3 inside ( tripple duplication on adset level ) ?
[19.09.25, 21:29:38] ~ Rui Bessa: yep
[19.09.25, 21:29:57] ~ Adam K.: thank you @⁨~Rui Bessa⁩
[19.09.25, 21:33:28] ~ Adam K.: used such strategy long time ago  with 5 same adsets inside  - but with minimum spend set to 5-10 usd to see which one gets quickest sale ( but it wasnt for testing but for proven creatives to scale )  + switching off others. Might be good to try testing as you mentioned  :)
[19.09.25, 21:38:03] ~ Rui Bessa: i tested this in completely brand new ad account to dont mix up strcutures..let it optimize for 3 days then optimize ad adset level.then 30%+ each day, its not as fast a triple duplicating with 5xbudget but in a week or so you can get to decent bidget campaign and the learnings stay in the same campaign/adset from the start
[19.09.25, 22:28:53] ~ Farhat Godil: hey guys Is there a way to not allow people to buy more than 2 quantity of same subscription items?
[19.09.25, 22:29:52] ~ Jacob: So whats ur minimum budget for a testing CBO?
[19.09.25, 22:30:04] ~ Jacob: Like 100$? ‎<This message was edited>
[19.09.25, 22:30:30] ~ Rui Bessa: 150-200
[19.09.25, 22:31:38] ~ Rui Bessa: Budget would go for
1-2adsets it right from the start
[19.09.25, 22:32:33] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Per day ?
[19.09.25, 23:27:23] ~ Ömer Karakullukçu: Hey guys, i want to create quiz funnel on shopify. Which app do you think is the best?
‎[19.09.25, 23:32:26] ~ L: ‎image omitted
[20.09.25, 1:21:44] ~ Austin: When I'm not hitting my target CPA I personally downscale or leave it same if at breakeven and weekends are near as buying behavior increases
[20.09.25, 1:23:39] ~ L: This is a new funnel — 
When I don’t hit the target CPA i usually just test more VSLs 

But here datas are so great that it looks like it might not be the issue
[20.09.25, 3:04:34] Yaniv: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added Yaniv
[20.09.25, 14:40:49] ~ Erzon: Hey guys, I have a HK setup and can't add Klarna via Shopify Payments. Does anyone know the best way to add Klarna? (without using OceanPayments or AirWallex)
[20.09.25, 17:19:06] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Open a UK Ltd, put the company details in shopify, and you'll have Klarna. Make payouts go straight to HK bank. Done ✅
[20.09.25, 18:07:25] ~ Mikael: anyone using Different entidy on Shopify payment and Paypal? (HK Paypal) how do you keep both complient?
[20.09.25, 19:47:53] ~ Jake: If someone sells warmed up TikTok ad accounts with worldwide targeting and no VAT / top up fees. Feel free to DM me
[20.09.25, 22:27:05] ~ Erzon: Thank you G I heard that before do you have a UK ltd?
[20.09.25, 22:36:42] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Yes. I'll DM you
[21.09.25, 0:14:40] ~ Austin: Do you guys know of any good reputation management agency’s? Please DM.
[21.09.25, 14:52:45] ~ Casper: Hey guys. Was wondering if anyone is successfully running advertorials in Europe, specifically Netherlands/Belgium, with any success? I'm noticing my traffic converts best when I just send them to the PP instead of advertorials. But i'd still like to increase my conversion. I'm in beauty niche (for men) with a product that actually needs some explaining.
[21.09.25, 15:04:00] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Guys, when launching new image ads, there is the meta image generation which sometimes is really cool. What AI image generator could give me a similar result? I give it an image and it gives me similar ones? 

Ideogram?
[21.09.25, 15:18:25] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Bro try Higgsfield. It's insane
[21.09.25, 15:18:46] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Best AI ever to generate images 🤩
[21.09.25, 15:19:06] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Thanks man 🙏🏻

[21.09.25, 15:38:24] ~ Jeremy: Any good ecom podcasts you can recommend?
[21.09.25, 15:39:26] ~ Jeremy: Obviously already listening to Alex's podcast
[21.09.25, 15:48:04] Topi: Europeans are not so used to that stuff

Just focus on whats working and decreasing your CPA with ab testing your pdp and making better ads
[21.09.25, 15:50:11] Topi: Best advertorials at least in nordics you find usually from real legit magazines, ”sponsored articles” , you can swipe angles and styles from there. Its quite different from what you see in the US.
[21.09.25, 16:02:04] ~ Casper: Check. Yeah I'm considering getting a sponsored article in Mens Health (netherlands). Thanks man!
[21.09.25, 18:01:27] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Hi all, 

My supplier messed up some features of my product which are not critical but in case repeated I want him to be accountable. 

What kind of document or agreement that should be signed ?
[21.09.25, 18:33:30] ~ F: Whats the best way to learn about media buying apart from what we have on the program? Any recommendations?
[21.09.25, 19:49:06] ~ Barnabás: Nick Therioth has a good one, but you can also learn a lot of things from his youtube
[21.09.25, 19:52:38] ~ F: Amazing thanks brother
[21.09.25, 22:56:10] Alex  Fedotoff: Hey legends! We're looking for another savage FB  media buyer to join one of our 8-fig beauty brands.

[22.09.25, 16:08:21] ~ Casper: Ben Heath on YT is solid man. Atleast, for META ads
[22.09.25, 16:17:01] ~ Allen David Shor: Konstantinos Dougeridis is good
[22.09.25, 18:34:49] ~ Giovanni Restelli: If I want to run ads from a new page, what has shown the best results? Doctor pages? Personal pages? Health care pages?

And how risky is to create a page around someone who doesn’t exist?

Thanks guys
[22.09.25, 18:37:03] Carlos Leeseman: Really simple, look at your angle and target avatar. If it’s VSL with doctor authority figure for example, then run on doctor page. If it’s first person UGC/VSL about overweight, then run on overweight page or something
[22.09.25, 18:38:02] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Makes sense thank you 🙏🏻 and what about the risk?
[22.09.25, 18:39:41] Carlos Leeseman: Hmmm what risk do you mean? You mean fake doctor page? Never faced any issues with this. Of course people will look on internet if that person really exist, so that’s why it’s always better to have a real authority figure for your brand
[22.09.25, 18:39:55] Carlos Leeseman: But in the beginning not necessary I would say
[22.09.25, 18:40:20] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah I meant if Facebook will get my page down because of that
[22.09.25, 19:20:39] ~ Drew Cable: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ Drew Cable

[22.09.25, 19:33:28] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Welcome man to the crew
[22.09.25, 19:52:28] ~ Erzon: Welcome 💪🏼
[22.09.25, 20:12:56] ~ B.A.: Hi Drew! Question: i accidently kept using my Dutch paypal, eventhough i had a hongkong paypal. Because my name was connected to both. My Dutch got blocked, and with that my HK. Is there a way to get my Hk back? (This was like 4 month ago)🤞🏻
[22.09.25, 20:14:47] Topi: I think Drew can give you better insights but we’ve recovered paypal from this situation twice with the help of lawyer
[22.09.25, 20:16:10] ~ Drew Cable: I’m primarily US and Canada but happy to look into it. Number is 2626201800 if you want to send me the primary emails.

[23.09.25, 16:59:38] ~ Malik: Thx a lot
[23.09.25, 17:01:21] ~ Rui Bessa: I feed Claude with all my product/market research docs and it comes up with really cool ideias for each avatar
[23.09.25, 17:32:12] ~ Lauren: @⁨~Ahmed HALKOUM⁩ if it’s us based you can have them sign a supplier agreement. 

It is a contract between you and the supplier outlining their responsibilities and your requirements and compliance and payment terms.

You can dm me if you have more questions.

The PD / Product Work in beauty / wellness I do for Sephora / Ulta / Sally’s / Target requires it.
[23.09.25, 17:37:29] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Does it need to us based sign a supplier agreement ? Supplier is from china
[23.09.25, 17:40:26] ~ Lauren: @⁨~Ahmed HALKOUM⁩ so China is a bit more difficult becuase depending where you are based it is more difficult to enforce / sue.

You’d need a good Chinese based lawyer and possibly I don’t know the right word for it but in the us it’s called agent of record. They are kind of a legal entity for you in China.

In my expierence, when a Chinese factory goes south unless you are running huge units - they don’t really care. Except for a few factories I’ve worked with.

If you are doing this the cheaper way you can make sure you get your BOM ahead of time which breaks down all the parts of the product. Then they are held more accountable in theory.
[23.09.25, 17:50:36] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Thanks Lauren, very helpful
[23.09.25, 18:00:29] ~ Matt: Hey does anyone have factory recommendations in Asia or China for bikini/swimwear brand?

[23.09.25, 18:52:48] ~ Lauren: Of course @⁨~Ahmed HALKOUM⁩ ! 

If you need a us factory recommendation that will ship for you in personal care, I can recommend you a factory with starting moq of 2k.

Otherwise hope my advice gets your sorted!
[23.09.25, 23:40:34] ~ Austin: Do you guys pay your funnel devs a weekly "Service Retainer" so they fix problems that come up throughout the week? I understand things break and they need to be improved, but a $3-400 a week retainer sounds like it gives an incentive to not get it done right in the first place when you pay for the project to be complete.
[23.09.25, 23:45:27] ~ David B: Here is the presentation from today's copy call as promised. https://www.canva.com/design/DAGzsfMT8-s/PMX5-DLMHBpXKOqJvH605w/edit

[24.09.25, 14:59:04] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Hey legends, 

How do you make people trust your brand ? 

I have some people commenting on my ads that this is a scam or send emails asking if it is a scam before they buy (they want to talk to a real perosn in emails). 

Does this happen to you too ?
[24.09.25, 15:00:05] Carlos Leeseman: Why do they say or think it’s scam? ‎<This message was edited>
[24.09.25, 15:02:36] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I think because my product design is not that common but still.not a good reason to think it is a scam.

 I have some customer that told me they got scammed before so they are skeptical. I see it more now
[24.09.25, 15:04:06] Carlos Leeseman: In that case it’s a objection you can tackle in your creatives with a authority person. For example a creator who is saying “I know it looks weird, I thought the same thing, etc”
[24.09.25, 15:04:55] Carlos Leeseman: And social proof/testimonials in your creative
[24.09.25, 15:10:12] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I am thinking of having a doctor review the product and run it as an ad ad and put on the website
[24.09.25, 15:10:46] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: @⁨Carlos Leeseman⁩ do you know how these doctors get to accept to give a recorded review ?
[24.09.25, 15:11:58] Carlos Leeseman: Best reach out to private clinics I think, but I think other people in this group knows this better
[24.09.25, 15:13:52] ~ Santi Roa: I’ve spent a lot of time working on this since I started, and I found it go be very simple yet extremely hard to implement

Just behave like a real brand and people will trust
[24.09.25, 15:14:29] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Guys I’m experiencing a huge drop in conversion rate last week. The only variable that changed was the offer, which I split tested for 14 days and the after proving that it was doing better I confirmed it. 

After that it passed a week with this offer and it was one of my best weeks overall in terms of cvr and AOV and then everything dropped. 

I was thinking about saturation of my advertorial and angle too narrow but I’ve only spend around 30k in ads for this angle and on that advertorial 😕

If you have ever experienced something similar would be awesome to get some insight 🙏🏻
[24.09.25, 15:15:13] ~ Santi Roa: What would a real brand do?
Have a unique product, customize it, launch new products
Have multiple communication channels, all branded
Have a solid branding, a professional website 
Have extremely good customer support
Have a 15 year vision and purpose. Do actions that impact on that purpose.
Tell a real story
Strengthen your supply chain
[24.09.25, 15:16:33] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Solid truth
[24.09.25, 16:34:19] ~ Jakub: No Payment Processing call today?

[24.09.25, 16:40:10] ~ Jakub: Thanks. I will shoot you a DM on WhatsApp
[24.09.25, 17:32:18] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Do you guys have something like an email template/survey that I can send to my old customers understand why they bought the product, what they think about it, etc
[24.09.25, 17:32:46] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I created one with GPT, but I was wondering if I was missing something, maybe some important information we want to have from them
[24.09.25, 18:22:20] ~ ARTURS: DM me, we have several we used accross many niches
[24.09.25, 18:32:56] ~ Jacob: Meta?
[24.09.25, 18:37:18] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah Meta could always be the issue but who knows haha
[24.09.25, 18:46:28] ~ L: Guys my editor is asking about captions - I’ve sent him some good VSL from where he could take inspo, and he asked me where to take the presets used . 

Any recommendations?
[24.09.25, 18:49:33] ~ Jacob: Yes its horrible this month
[24.09.25, 18:50:44] ~ Jacob: Very unstable
[24.09.25, 18:51:46] ~ Jacob: I suggest u alocate your budget to more platforms
[24.09.25, 18:52:49] ~ Jacob: Maybe if enough advertisers will lower budget they will reverse the weird algorithm changes they did lately lol
[24.09.25, 18:53:22] ~ Cocow😈: Take screen shot , put image on canva and do text recognition. Maybe you will find their font
[24.09.25, 18:54:16] ~ L: Yes beside the font, is talking about presets
[24.09.25, 18:56:15] ~ Cocow😈: Go to captions , try to find the presets and replicate
[24.09.25, 18:56:21] ~ Cocow😈: If he takes time we will find
[24.09.25, 18:57:34] ~ Cocow😈: But if you want to do animations like captions word to word , this is a plugin : autocut for example, sub machine , etc 

Or , he puts the video on captions , generate captions and put green screen. Then , he can use this easily
[24.09.25, 19:12:53] ~ F: whats up everyone. we will start running a supplements brand and I’m wondering if we should use an old pixel from the gaming niche with 2M+ in conversions, or a brand new pixel?

we can use the gaming one eventho audience is completely different, right?
[24.09.25, 20:19:49] ~ David Herold: Hi guys, do you use any app for FB pixel on Shopify? I will probably need to use several pixels, do you recommend some app?
[24.09.25, 22:30:38] ~ Jeremy: Meta is very unstable lately. So it might just be a Meta issue with you getting low quality traffic. Still, I would run some ads to your old offer again to see if it performs better. Maybe your test size wasn't big enough and it actually doesn't perform better than your control.
[24.09.25, 22:31:39] ~ Jeremy: I would use a new pixel. The gaming pixel is trained on the wrong audience.
[25.09.25, 3:37:19] ~ Kan: ‎~ Salma Jimenez added Kan
[25.09.25, 6:43:41] ~ Luka: People will always be worried whether your brand is legit, and whether the product can do what it promises it does. This is our approach to building a long-term brand that we can raise funds (undecided) and exit one day. We used to get similar comments but that has dropped significantly. Ask yourself: What instantly makes you trust brands you buy from? And also basically do what the top brands do:

* *HQ Photoshoots & Video shoots* - This will instantly build trust. HQ product photography (with logo on product), HQ Lifestyle photos to use in creatives, LPs & pre-sells. Even in your carousel you can add a photo which clearly shows your logo on the label/product.
* ⁠*Great brand visuals & designs* - High quality packaging, beautiful PDPs/LPs, emails, static ads etc. We have a full-time graphic designer and just onboarding a new one in a week.
* ⁠*Creative Diversity* - Have HQ Studio Production ads (static+video), UGCs, testimonials, statics, regular ecom style ads, ugly ads etc. This is where building a strong creative team really matters. We hired an ex-TVC (TV Commerical) to be our lead creative strategist. 
* ⁠*Strong Social Media* - A lot of people do check your FB/IG profile. Develop a strategy around that too. For us, we use only HQ photography with minimal text on our social media. For IG, build out proper Instagram Highlights. Can be a bunch of stuff, but the first or 2nd one ideally you want to put all the stories that you’re tagged in so there is instant social proof. Then the other ones can be guarantee, how-to, value stuff, tips/quizes etc. Put yourself in the customer’s perspective: what would YOU want to see? 
* ⁠*Run More Ads* - Over time the same people will see a lot of your ads and eventually buy. Constnatly seeing your ads = builds trust.
* ⁠*OmniChannel Approach* - Be everywhere with re-targeting. FB, Google, YT, TikTok etc. This makes your brand appear famous and everywhere.
* ⁠*Interact with comments* - Talk with comments on a human-level so they see it’s a real brand
* ⁠*Humanize The Brand* - PDPs/LPs etc should show HUMANS. This is generally a priority for us. In the carousel we should have lifestyle photos, imagery, a ton of social proof (and not just reviews, but select reviews that show real people in them whether it’s photo or video reviews)

Some others:
* Are influencers tagging you? Some people check who tagged you on IG
* ⁠Authority ads - have authority figures in the ads.
* ⁠Celebs or Mini-Celebs in the niche - a more expensive approach, but will instantly build trust
* ⁠Whitelisting - re-target existing customers via whitelisting ads so they see others (from their own personal accounts) talking about your brand
* ⁠If your product looks like all others, unless you’re already the dominant player for it - work with your factory to change the design to make it more unique. Costs extra but worth it to separate your product from 999999 others of the same design. ‎<This message was edited>
[25.09.25, 6:48:55] ~ Luka: ^ many of these might seem logical, but I wish someone listed these out when I transitioned from dropshipping to building a real value-based brand.

One of the KEY factors was investing in studio-quality photo & video shoots. It had a big influence on building brand trust, growth, people wanting to partner with our brand and having more people share our brand.

We even had a charity we donate products to, make a video about us with the US Embassy Staff donating our products to people in need. We never asked them to, they did it by themselves.

TL:DR - Do what big brands do. Humanize the brand, HQ photos/videos, strong creative strategy, good social media presence (people check), have customers/influencers tag you, etc.

Of course these are building blocks to a brand. There are many brands that do significant numbers without doing the above. ‎<This message was edited>
[25.09.25, 8:57:26] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Guys, for those of you who run VSLs, did you see a drop of performance of iterations after Andromeda or they are still working nicely?
[25.09.25, 9:14:10] ~ Jakub: 🙏🙏
[25.09.25, 9:15:03] ~ Giovanni Restelli: I’ll dm you
[25.09.25, 12:40:55] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey guys — quick question. Has anyone had Meta Ads tank after turning on price A/B testing with the Elevate app (it splits traffic via redirects to different URLs)? Right after we enabled it, our daily spend fell from ~$5k to $0, and when we restarted, CPM shot up to ~$250 (was ~$40–50 before). Could this be a shadow ban/learning reset caused by the redirects?

Also, is there a way to A/B test prices on Shopify without using redirects (native options or apps that keep a single URL)?
[25.09.25, 13:20:21] ~ F: how do you all test new products for a completely new brand? ABO? CBO forcing X spend per adset? Now that meta is pushing more CBO’s idk if running the first test in ABO is still the right move
[25.09.25, 14:57:48] ~ L: when a new offer I put everything in CBO budget is 4x my TargetCPA 

1 Adset p. Concept Message 

The Best spender will be turned off if CPA are not in target after 2xTargetCPA Spent 

3/4 day maximum and you find your winner 


Scale from there
[25.09.25, 20:16:17] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Does anyone knows if the payment method TWINT is a must for Swiss market or can you make it work the same only with Card+Klarna+Paypal?
[25.09.25, 20:30:39] ~ Mike Ramsey: On average about 1/3rd of online payments from that market are made using TWINT.  It would be similar to selling to Germany without Klarna or Paypal.

You’ll likely see drop off if you don’t have it.  Best to light it up and have it available.
[25.09.25, 20:32:37] ~ Farhat Godil: What is the best platform to hire influencers for UGC videos? + any reviews on Insense ‎<This message was edited>
[25.09.25, 20:33:10] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Ty Mike. Got it
[25.09.25, 20:58:10] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: What would be the way of having Twint? Because there’s no Twint on Shopify Payments, neither in Funnelish/Stripe
[25.09.25, 21:02:41] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I use instagram and backstage. Check the module "sourcing creatives" in skool it has lots if useful infos
[25.09.25, 21:04:17] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Have someone outreach to #ugc etc., meta even has it’s own platform for getting creators, you can set out campaigns for what you need and have people come to you
[25.09.25, 21:05:23] ~ Farhat Godil: Can you share more about meta platform

[25.09.25, 22:31:29] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Is anyone using Brandwise? I have some quick questions
[25.09.25, 23:38:40] ~ John B: guys for anyone that has launched a brand from scratch with a new product to market. Did you start selling your product with discounts or did you just leave it at standard price. This is my first brand starting with a bulk amount, so not dropshipping, and i’ve always done the typical BOGOs or 50% offs (just making the compare at price 50% higher than what my actual price is) but i’m not sure if this is the way to go with a brand new product. Figure it might ruin perceived value, especially because I plan to raise the price in the future and don’t want customers seeing the discounted price as the only price it’s worth. Hopefully that makes sense, any insights would be super helpful.

[26.09.25, 8:57:36] ~ Jake: Hi guys does anyone have connections to Shopify Plus

And can maybe get us a better deal?
[26.09.25, 10:07:37] ~ Jeremy: First of all, I think most people won't remember your brand and exact pricing.

And even for the few ones that do, I don't believe it will hurt your brand reputation as long as you give a good reason for the sale, e.g. "autumn sale", "early black friday sale" etc.
[26.09.25, 10:15:48] ~ Casper: Hey Guys. This week has been crazy for me with META Ads. My best performing campaign (did 4x ROAS last week is not getting any sales). Also, another campaign is showing a certain amount of conversions yesterday, which are more conversions than I had in total on my store (and 50% of these sales where exsisting customers). It's a retargeting campaign where I excluded exsisting customers, so they should not even be able to see these ads. Any suggestions what I can do? I use Trackbee + Triple Whale + CAPI maximum + Pixel + GTM for my tracking..
[26.09.25, 10:18:25] ~ 👀: I’m looking for a German-speaking customer service representative who can answer the phone. Does anyone have experience with this? Where can I find these people?
[26.09.25, 10:47:38] Topi: We got ours from upwork
[26.09.25, 11:55:21] ~ Jeremy: Meta ads are very volatile &buggy right now. It's likely because of the andromeda update. Many accounts are affected.
[26.09.25, 12:28:25] ~ L: Does anyone know how long it’ll last ?
[26.09.25, 14:54:26] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Guys, about retargeting ads, do you always stick to the rule 10% of the total daily adspent or sometimes you push more? Of course in Q4 we all want to push more on them but I was wondering if you sometimes see them being very profitable even if not limiting them to 10% of the total ad spent
[26.09.25, 15:47:51] ~ Cocow😈: For me there is not really a big rule 

If you scale and they are profitable why reduce but you have to make sure to fill your TOF audiences as well. Retargeting is a bit tricky to manage but you can as well consider meta doing the retargeting even on CBO scaling , it all depends on your message and your creative
[26.09.25, 15:48:56] ~ Cocow😈: We try to consolidate our ad account more and more and avoid having retargeting cause you say it is good because roas are higher but this is normal. Probably your CBO would performs better cause retargeting is eating the audience of the CBO ( maybe)
[26.09.25, 15:55:49] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Yeah of course I’m retargeting only in the copy not in the settings and I feel like now I’m in a sweet spot and I’m not sure if it would be healthy to launch new ones or scale the running ones up
[26.09.25, 15:56:58] ~ Giovanni Restelli: But I’ll try understanding what you said. I think we can create some custom audience that we can see in the breakdowns, right? Like if Facebook is spending on engages audience or cold etc
[26.09.25, 18:04:51] ~ Jacob: The new way the andromeda works, that its actually do the retargeting alone as long as you build your campaign right, especially on higher budget, i really suggest youll watch few videos on the update
[26.09.25, 18:06:25] ~ Jacob: If youll have inside your campaign tof, mof and bof ads, meta will alocate the budget automatically to the tof, and when people are warmer he will send them to bof by himself , so actually retargeting is not really necesary
[26.09.25, 18:07:58] ~ Jacob: And again , watch some recent videos on the update , it will help u a lot
[26.09.25, 18:09:31] ~ Jacob: And all of this important in higher budgets, in small budgets it doesent really matter
[26.09.25, 18:19:20] ~ Jacob: And another way that meta push this is by adding the "relative media" feature. If youll notice inside the ad, meta now finding with the ai creatives that are similar to the creatives u uploaded in your account, and if u approve this option, meta will play with those creatives, i guess to warm people more, and show them more creatives, so they actually adding features, in my opinion, that are pushing retargeting within the meta system itself. And btw, u dont have control on those he choose, you cannot change it in this feature ‎<This message was edited>
[26.09.25, 19:54:29] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Did you guys see a lower return rate if you let the customer ship the product himself instead of giving him a return label (I assume you did)
[26.09.25, 19:57:05] ~ Austin: We issue return labels if there’s something we did wrong such as wrong order / products….if they just don’t like it shipping cost to return it is on them….we clearly specify this anywhere returns / refunds are mentioned….not sure how much that impact return rate as that’s how we’ve always done it.
[26.09.25, 19:59:33] ~ Cocow😈: Advertising settings and the you setup after go into your columns and breakdown by audience report 🙂
[26.09.25, 19:59:45] ~ Allan L: Same as we do. If we make a mistake or send a bad product, we pay the return. 
If they are just not satisfied, they pay the return shipping. 
We have a local warehouse tho, so they dont have to pay much more than 6-7 euros. We offer a returnportal where they Can buy the label as well
[26.09.25, 20:03:58] ~ Austin: We have local warehouse in states as well, so shipping is rarely more than $5-6….weeks rarely get bad feedback from customers about it…I believe transparency has a lot to do with it
[26.09.25, 20:10:29] ~ 👀: Under whitch section we can Find new updated content for this topic?
[26.09.25, 20:33:04] ~ Jacob: I mean youtube , just write andromeda update, a lot is talking about this now
[26.09.25, 20:47:24] ~ Giovanni Restelli: Can someone share with me how is your Customer Service setup? What app or tool you’re using, what are the processes you tell your VA to do answering tickets, what review app you’re using and how is your flow setup there? After how many days you send review requests and do you use a specific template or the very basic one from Loox for example?

[27.09.25, 17:57:31] ~ Erzon: Just do a warm up campaign with interaction at 3-5$, post a quote and let it on for 24h then you can turn it off and start running your ads

[29.09.25, 23:55:50] ~ Jacob: need to check
[29.09.25, 23:57:43] ~ Jacob: 🔵 Data Tab (Dynamic content)

This lets you bind elements (like headlines, prices, product names) to dynamic data sources instead of hardcoding text.
Ecommerce uses:

Personalization: Show the customer’s name in a headline (“Hey Sarah, your cart is waiting!”).

Dynamic pricing/offers: Pull price, discount, or stock availability directly from your product data feed.

Cart/checkout info: Bind text to the customer’s selected product, quantity, or bundle — so headlines or CTAs adapt automatically.

A/B testing hooks: Show different text based on audience segments (e.g., cold vs. warm traffic).

🟣 Interaction Tab (Behavior & triggers)

This controls what happens when a user clicks, hovers, or leaves an element.
Ecommerce uses:

On click:

Add product to cart instantly.

Trigger upsell popups or side-cart slides.

Scroll to checkout or open a hidden guarantee/FAQ section.

On mouse over:

Show urgency (e.g., “🔥 Only 2 left in stock!”).

Highlight product benefits or testimonials.

On mouse leave:

Trigger an exit-intent popup with a discount or free shipping offer.

Run JavaScript:

Fire tracking pixels (Meta, TikTok, GA4) for custom conversions.

Send events to Klaviyo/CRM (e.g., “Started Checkout” or “Hovered on Upsell”).

👉 In short:

Data = personalization & dynamic ecommerce info.

Interaction = conversion-boosting behaviors & triggers.

[30.09.25, 6:33:02] ~ Andrew Wan: Which claude version is best for copy?
[30.09.25, 7:51:54] ~ Arin: Hey Austin, I used Cin7 for about 5 years until last month. I had over 1000 SKUs. Its pretty robust but it is costly. And expect price increases every year. It has more features than you will ever need so you are paying for features that you dont actually need. Integration with Shopify is great. If you use Xero as an accounting system, they work really nicely together.  But what Cin7 does, Zoho can do as well at a lower cost. Interface is also better and simpler to use. Cheaper as well and support is also better. Cin7 support sucks. Id suggest looking at Zoho before anything else. 

If you have a more simpler operation, Qoblex may also be a good option and priced really nicely. Shopify and Xero integration is decent. Support is good. Its a Norwegian business.

Hope this helps.
[30.09.25, 9:12:27] ~ Mark: Hey guys, is creative fatique a real thing? I have ads that crushed, but stopped performing after a week. I duplicated them with just changing the hook in the primary text, and these are performing great again.

I find it weird because it means that Meta itself stops liking the ad after a certain period of time, not the audience.
[30.09.25, 9:15:46] Malachi: Like all you did was change the hook of the primary text?
Did you copy the ad id of the winning ad itself
[30.09.25, 9:23:10] ~ Mark: Just duplicate, not copy of the ID

I’m not the biggest expert, but I’ve learned a lot building a brand from 0 to 45M/year in 4 years—all while still taking vacations and spending time with family. Along the way I built a company that can grow without me, a product no one can copy, and hired over 80 people (today we’re a team of 40 full-time employees).

Looking forward to sharing what worked (and what didn’t) and learning together!
[1.10.25, 1:51:56] Fabian: Hey guys

For anyone wondering about the Shopify X ChatGPT update - 

My SEO team built this: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17a9CSdGok--XMq7QMSyvMZDrGxguy8hnQYFLIQ5O9oc/edit?usp=sharing

Highly recommend to send this to your dev team to implement
[1.10.25, 6:53:52] ~ Mikael: When you guys throw in new creatives into a ADV+ Campaign. do you throw in a new adset or do you upload the new creatives into the existing adset and only use 1 adset inside adv+? or do you use several different adsets?
[1.10.25, 11:06:23] ~ Allen David Shor: Hey, you can find some detailed insights about the Andromeda update here: https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/02/production-engineering/meta-andromeda-advantage-automation-next-gen-personalized-ads-retrieval-engine/
[1.10.25, 11:12:45] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Looks like personalization is the key word in this new update
[1.10.25, 11:13:29] ~ Allen David Shor: Yep
[1.10.25, 11:15:10] ~ Mark: Each funnel structured for one persona?
[1.10.25, 11:17:19] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: I think this persona funnel worked even before the update because it just help in conversions better but the andromeda is more about personalization of the ads.
[1.10.25, 11:18:15] Carlos Leeseman: Yes really nice update in fact, and I recommend everyone check Nick Theriot his latest video about the Andromeda update where he explains everything really clear and why 1 campaign CBO structure might be the best strategy at the moment! ‎<This message was edited>
[1.10.25, 11:18:38] Carlos Leeseman: https://youtu.be/FWB6rAVm4Fk?si=mclo1NEFFvi4fEYK
[1.10.25, 11:20:32] ~ Mark: Is it better to literally have one with alll the ads and scale it up that way?
[1.10.25, 11:25:35] Carlos Leeseman: It’s something we’re testing now, but one of the things about Andromeda update is that Meta algorithm became better, because of AI learnings. When someone interacts with one of your ads, Meta will show multiple ads in a short period of time that your target persona finds interesting/appealing as well, that is similar as your initial ad. This is easier if everything is stacked in one campaign, allowing Facebook to determine where to spend/distribute the money.

But I can’t say 1 campaign is the best strategy, because it’s something we’re testing now. If you run multiple products, offers or funnels, you still need to separate this
[1.10.25, 14:22:36] ~ Iskander Zrouga: Heyy everyone, we’re hiring video editors, a ui/ux designer, & a shopify dev. Plz dm if u can recommend someone 🙏

[1.10.25, 16:46:23] ~ P: Dupe it instead and try a higher cap
[1.10.25, 17:41:00] ~ RS: Is everything ok with funnelish for you today? Orders in shopify are generated without delays as usual and no duplicate charges from customers for upsells etc?
[1.10.25, 18:05:27] ~ Marc F: Anyone not using Claude for copywriting is missing out on serious money
[1.10.25, 18:05:41] ~ Mark: Frrrrrr
[1.10.25, 18:06:52] ~ Marc F: Just created a project, fed it PDF books from legendary copywriters and some of the best sales letters in history and the results are unreal
[1.10.25, 19:21:51] ~ Mark: Hey if I am running one CBO for everything, am I allowed to also test different landing pages in there? 

I heard it might damage performance but what is your experience with that
[1.10.25, 19:29:30] ~ L: Really interested as well - I have 1CBO multiple adsets broad
3 more advertorials to test
[1.10.25, 19:30:35] ~ Hunter Davenport: If you’re going to test landing pages I would definitely do that in a separate campaign. That way you can easily see which gives you lower CPA
[1.10.25, 19:32:30] ~ L: Same VSLs tho? 

Since the new andromeda update also channel the spent based on the landing I thought it was one more reason to test the same VLSs but with different landers 

What do you guys think?
[1.10.25, 19:33:01] ~ Hunter Davenport: Yeah same VSLs
[1.10.25, 19:33:22] ~ Hunter Davenport: Only test one variable which is the landing page
[1.10.25, 20:25:22] Malachi: what are your thoughts on simply uploading (amount of creatives) into an ad set in your CBO campaign, duplicating the ad set 2-3x times, and just changing the landing page per ad set. This way the variables are all the same, same ads, and only the landing pages are the only difference?
[1.10.25, 20:25:57] Malachi: I have heard that with andromeda you don’t want a ton of campaigns, so wouldn’t it make sense to test everything in the same CBO campaign
[1.10.25, 20:31:52] ~ Marc F: he talks about that and a lot more here: https://youtu.be/FWB6rAVm4Fk?si=mclo1NEFFvi4fEYK
[1.10.25, 20:32:04] Malachi: just watched the entire video actually
[1.10.25, 20:32:06] Malachi: gold
[1.10.25, 20:32:14] ~ Hunter Davenport: Yeah he says he uses a separate campaign for different landing pages^
[1.10.25, 20:33:11] Malachi: i must have misunderstood that part. So create a new campaign, and test just the landing pages from there. And when you have a winner, you can start using that landing page for all of your tests in the main testing cbo
[1.10.25, 20:34:22] ~ Jakub: Hey guys! Do you still use Lookalike audiences in your campaigns after the Andromeda update and overall how Meta wants the algorithm to do the targeting? Thanks! 🙏

I’m looking forward to finding new strategies
[2.10.25, 0:43:05] ~ Austin: Not much adaptation on my end, btu personally I think its a great update and once adjusted will turn better results
[2.10.25, 0:43:25] ~ Austin: Personally we're not seeing massive performance changes
[2.10.25, 0:43:58] ~ Austin: We get way less spikes of traffic now, and things stay more consistent throughout the day
[2.10.25, 0:44:44] ~ Mark: @⁨~Austin⁩ are you having separate scaling campaigns or just one for all
[2.10.25, 1:44:37] ~ John B: Do you guys plan on running just one offer throughout BFCM? (including the week or two leading up to it and after) We’re a fairly new brand so we don’t really have any validation from last years BFCM that tells us we should def stick to one. We plan on doing 2, possibly 3, throughout the two weeks prior and then 3 days after Cyber Monday, but I’d be interested to see your guys’ thoughts.
[2.10.25, 2:44:13] ~ Austin: Hey man tbh I’m running ALOT of CBO’s….probably close to 20 with 3-6 creatives each…each week we test in ABO then we push A/B/C tier CBO’s with top 10/20 & 30% performers from previous weeks tests…it’s FAR from what just about any source suggests but it’s been great so far and not a drop off from the update…..yet….more consolidation will probably be out next move though
[2.10.25, 14:15:12] ~ Giovanni: Hey guys, does someone have something like a doc or a sheet or a template that you use for your research?

I feel like I’m always missing something in my research because I don’t know how to name and list it and sometimes it could happen that I ignore important informations. 

And besides Amazon reviews, Reddit and Facebook groups, what’s the best place to find those information?

Let me know 🙏🏻

Our new skus all having same issues with inconsistency for sales velocity and ranking, now these are only FBA private label products not sold on Shopify before, anyone got a clue on what could be done to stay dynamic? Or us overall is getting saturated?
[2.10.25, 23:11:25] ~ Colby: When cleaning up ads do yall delete them or just turn off
[3.10.25, 0:30:45] ~ Giovanni: I never delete
[3.10.25, 0:34:43] ~ Nicolas: unrelated but: Anyone here well-knowledged with windows system, bios updates and stuff?

i have a problem with my laptop and need a quick fix and i’m willing to pay as i need the laptop tomorrow and it’s a holiday here in germany tomorrow 🫠
[3.10.25, 1:12:40] ~ Kevin Krieg: best to keep them for the data. otherwise harder to read data and also at some point you might want to check the data of it. like what was the hookrate of that...why did it fail.. etc
[3.10.25, 1:21:06] ~ danny: they just didn’t get any spend
[3.10.25, 1:51:56] ~ Memed: You can still see deleted ads if you filter ads that are not active
[3.10.25, 19:08:18] ~ eman: Guys what should I do if my new ad account I recently made isn’t spending any money on my campaigns? I have 4 active campaigns but they are not spending anything, the ad account is completely new, new pixel, new FB page, etc.

Any tips? Much appreciated!
‎[3.10.25, 21:01:39] ~ Mike Ramsey: ‎image omitted
[3.10.25, 21:20:52] ~ Drew Cable: Great call out Mike. Redundancy is key. Let me know if you need any help with PayPal or any other intros
[3.10.25, 21:31:47] ~ Santi Roa: Hey everyone!
We had a great call last Wednesday 🙌 Thanks to everyone who joined, asked questions, and shared. We’ll keep doing these calls bi-weekly, and the next one is already scheduled for October 15th — hope to see you there!

In case you missed it, here are some of the highlights & key takeaways from the last session:

### **Q1 – Logistics & Supply Chain**

**Question:**
“When should I hire someone (like a logistics manager in China)? I’m managing suppliers, forwarders, and warehouses myself. It’s time-consuming.”

**Your Teachings (expanded):**

* **Don’t rush into full-time hires.** At early stages (e.g., \$50k/month, one hire), you don’t need a dedicated supply chain manager. Focus on leverage instead of overhead.
* **Track your time.** Identify the areas that drain the most hours and start outsourcing those (e.g., video editing, support). Supply chain tasks are complex but not always worth handing off early.
* **Use sourcing agents.** Instead of a full-time hire, test sourcing agents on platforms like Upwork. Interview multiple, run a test project (e.g., source a product with sample pricing breakdowns).
* **Why sourcing agents matter:**

  * Unlock factories that don’t speak English → prices 30–50% lower.
  * Handle QC, negotiation, shipping coordination.
  * Act as your single point of contact in China.
* **Play long-term.** If you plan 1,000+ SKUs, or work with regulated/complex products (food, supplements), then consider a full-time hire. Until then, sourcing agents + SOPs will save you time and money.

👉 **Lesson:** Don’t outsource complexity too early. Build SOPs and test agents before adding fixed costs.

---

### **Q2 – Post-Purchase Upsells & AOV**

**Question:**
“How can I build better upsell flows on Shopify? Current apps are too rigid.”

**Your Teachings (expanded):**

* **Checkout Champ = best-in-class**, but requires devs and doesn’t integrate with Shopify Payments. For high-volume sellers, it can boost AOV by 30–50%.
* **Alternatives:** Funnelish, AfterShip, GM Pages — decent but limited. Test based on simplicity vs. complexity tolerance.
* **Industry shift:** Lookalikes are dead. Meta’s new “Andromeda” system favors broad targeting + creative volume. Best results now come from **creative testing and funnel design**, not micro-targeting.
* **Emerging strategy:** Quiz funnels. They convert higher because they:

  * Collect customer info through interactive questions.
  * Personalize the offer (e.g., “Which type of jewelry suits your style?”).
  * Reinforce value during the quiz → smoother sales conversion.
* **Practical tip:** If upsells feel pushy, reframe them as “bundles” or “personalized recommendations.” Customers respond better.

👉 **Lesson:** Don’t obsess over apps. Obsess over *offers and funnel design*. Tech is just the enabler.

---

### **Q3 – Work-Life Balance as a Founder**

**Question:**
“At what level can I slow down and spend more time with family? I’m working 8 am–10 pm every day.”

**Your Teachings (expanded):**

* **Hours worked ≠ results.** Shared the Rockefeller vs. Carnegie example: Rockefeller worked himself to sickness, Carnegie played golf and built a \$400B fortune. Success comes from better *choices*, not just more effort.
* **Your journey:**

  * First year: 12–15 hours/day.
  * Then gradually set boundaries → stopped Sundays, then Saturdays, then cut off at 6 PM, later 5 PM.
  * Built habits: reading daily, mentorships, delegation.
* **Efficiency unlocks freedom:**

  * Sleep better, wake earlier (5 am = distraction-free work).
  * Eliminate time wasters (social media, WhatsApp).
  * Use books like *Clockwork* to map where your hours actually go.
* **Constraints force growth.** You make better decisions when you *must* stop at 5 PM. Same for your employees.

👉 **Lesson:** Balance doesn’t come from “making it big.” It comes from designing your systems, your energy, and your boundaries.

---

### **Q4 – When to Switch to a U.S. 3PL**

**Question:**
“We’re launching jewelry with 600 units. At what point should we move from our agent in China to a U.S. 3PL?”

**Your Teachings (expanded):**

* **Too early to switch.** First, validate demand.
* **Step 1:** Use your agent or CJ Dropshipping-style service (even if they charge a fee). Simple, low-risk.
* **Step 2:** Once you sell consistently, then evaluate U.S. 3PLs.
* **Beware 3PL costs:** They charge for everything → storage, receiving, pick/pack, tape, customer service. At high volumes, you’ll need a team member just to audit invoices.
* **3PLs love jewelry.** Small/light products with few SKUs are ideal. But until you have predictable sales, stay flexible.

👉 **Lesson:** Early on, speed to market > optimizing fulfillment. Move to U.S. 3PL only once volume justifies the complexity.

---

### **Q5 – Role Evolution as a Founder**

**Question:**
“How has your role changed over the years as your company grew?”

**Your Teachings (expanded):**

* **Stage 1:** Did everything (dropshipping solo).
* **Stage 2:** Delegated execution (video editors, media buyers).
* **Stage 3:** Built leaders → mistake: too many juniors managing juniors → chaos.
* **Stage 4:** Consolidated → focused on multiplying leaders, building a real management team.
* **Stage 5 (now):** Set vision, culture, long-term strategy. Talk to mentors and billion-dollar CEOs. Stay as “captain of the ship.”
* **Frameworks you use:** EOS (*Traction*) for alignment. Long-term focus: CEO’s job is not “do tasks,” but **raise company valuation by aligning vision + multiplying people.**

👉 **Lesson:** As CEO, your job evolves from “operator” → “multiplier” → “visionary.” If you’re still in the weeds, your ship risks going in circles.

---

### **Q6 – Breakthrough Ideas from Employees**

**Question:**
“My marketing employee executes well, but big ideas don’t come from her. Should I always be the one driving creativity?”

**Your Teachings (expanded):**

* **Big ideas can come from anyone.** Examples: Google Maps, 3M Post-it Notes, Disney innovations — all came from employees, not founders.
* **Motivation > equity.** You don’t have to give equity for employees to innovate. You can:

  * Pay well.
  * Provide mentorships/training.
  * Expose them to higher-level thinking (events, trips, workshops).
* **But be realistic:**

  * The team that gets you \$0 → \$1M isn’t always the team that gets you \$1M → \$10M.
  * Some employees won’t evolve into senior roles → you’ll need to upgrade talent.
* **Practical next steps:**

  * Clarify what you expect (campaign ideas? new channels? product launches?).
  * Set KPIs.
  * Complement juniors with experienced hires or mentors.

👉 **Lesson:** Employees *can* innovate, but only if you create the environment, clarity, and incentives for it. Otherwise, founders will remain the main source of vision.

---

# ⚡ Closing Thought

Your teachings boiled down to this:

* **Think long-term.** Build systems and culture, not just products.
* **Leverage smartly.** Outsource, delegate, and hire with intention.
* **Stay the captain.** CEO’s job is to set vision and multiply people, not get lost in execution.
* **Balance life.** Work boundaries aren’t luxuries — they’re constraints that force you and your team to grow smarter.

[4.10.25, 19:48:48] ~ Giovanni: Are native ads working better on mobile like others? Or desktop as well?
[5.10.25, 11:41:08] ~ Mikael: Hey! Do you guys see any performance difference if you scale 1 Product vs several Products on the same store?

[5.10.25, 12:57:36] ~ Mark: Hey, could someone help me correctly setup my taboola tracking? Any help would be very appreciated🫡
[5.10.25, 12:59:07] ~ Giovanni: I did it yesterday, for Shopify it’s actually very easy, just follow the instructions.

For Funnelish I still don’t know and I’m probably going to reach out to their support ‎<This message was edited>
[5.10.25, 12:59:53] ~ Giovanni: But I think we have to put some code
[5.10.25, 12:59:59] ~ Mark: My conversions are all over the place and are duplicated dozens of times
[5.10.25, 13:00:43] ~ Giovanni: Oh really? I don’t have this problem atm
[5.10.25, 13:01:12] ~ Mark: I’ll dm you rn
[5.10.25, 13:11:35] ~ Cocow: Funnelish support will not help you at all. YOu can use GTM for tracking. We are working with these guys they are fast and responsive. Yu just have to explain correctly what you need and what events you want to track and push: https://www.fiverr.com/ismail334766
[5.10.25, 13:12:20] ~ Giovanni: Yeah I meant reaching out to Taboola support but thank you
[5.10.25, 13:13:02] ~ Cocow: You can, this will take you 1 month and not sure this will work (experience done...)
[5.10.25, 13:14:20] ~ Giovanni: Got it thank you 😂🙏🏻
[5.10.25, 17:22:20] ~ John B: Anyone been using Sora 2? Started yesterday and the results were crazy. I couldn’t tell that the people are ai once I got the prompts somewhat right
[5.10.25, 17:23:06] ~ danny: i’ve seen the videos they r wild. how do u get it?
[5.10.25, 17:23:16] ~ L: Me, just shared the tool with my editors . Just too good for ugc brolls
[5.10.25, 17:24:01] ~ Allan L: But Can it hold a product without the product looks out of shape when moving it?
[5.10.25, 17:26:14] ~ L: No, I’m not talking about clips with the product rather than clips where people are in pain for my vsls
[5.10.25, 17:26:48] ~ John B: I tested this slightly, our product is simple and it does it well if the person is moving it on a table rather than being completely held, the biggest pain it was giving me was making it too large relative to the persons hand.
[5.10.25, 17:29:44] ~ John B: But eventually I got perfect generations within 2/3 hours… it doesn’t completely replace UGC/ creators yet, but the content I need from real people now just dropped by a third, saving time and money
[5.10.25, 17:51:26] ~ Ziga: how do you guys access it outside of USA? VPN or through another tool?
[5.10.25, 17:51:39] ~ John B: Yes VPN

[5.10.25, 18:04:13] ~ Ziga: free - used a secondary email
[5.10.25, 18:04:26] ~ Ziga: Signed up through a VPN ‎<This message was edited>
[5.10.25, 18:05:36] ~ John B: Also for anyone using it, this is the best video watermark remover I’ve found. Bc with sora 2 you can’t remove water mark (If it makes you pay after x amount just go on incognito) : https://magiceraser.org/remove-watermark-from-video/
[5.10.25, 18:42:46] ~ danny: thanks for the code 🙏🙏
[5.10.25, 18:50:08] ~ danny: do you get unlimited sora 2 generations ?
[5.10.25, 18:52:22] ~ John B: Yes but can only generate 5 at a time
[5.10.25, 19:15:38] ~ Colby: Do you have any tips for the prompts. Keep it more simple or be super detailed
[5.10.25, 19:16:57] ~ John B: For the shots I was making I found better results with shorter prompts I made myself instead of trying to use gpt to write them. But i’m sure this might change depending on what you’re looking to create
[5.10.25, 21:59:43] ~ Matthew: I second this, I’m also in dire need of
[5.10.25, 22:00:50] ~ danny: this link worked for me but u gotta try it a few times
[5.10.25, 22:00:59] ~ danny: ^
[5.10.25, 22:01:41] ~ danny: it makes pretty good videos, testing it right now with avatar testimonials and driving curiosity clicks to advertorial
[6.10.25, 1:34:32] ~ danny: not sure how to do it yet but some people get the exact same avatar and make multiple clips that go together
[6.10.25, 1:34:36] ~ danny: looks very good
[6.10.25, 1:37:58] ~ John B: I think for the avatar you just upload a reference img. What i’m trying to figure out rn is how to make it the same voice
[6.10.25, 1:38:33] ~ danny: mine keeps saying i can’t use a person lol
[6.10.25, 1:38:38] ~ danny: was it a cameo?
[6.10.25, 1:39:04] ~ danny: did u make a cameo for the avatar ?
[6.10.25, 2:51:19] ~ Matthew: ^ yeah I second this.  How do you keep the avatar consistent
[6.10.25, 4:44:00] ~ Henry: Hey guys, anyone know an animator who can make 3D medical animations and is actually fast?
[6.10.25, 14:27:41] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys!
[6.10.25, 14:27:43] ~ Alejandro H.: Curious to know — what strategies or approaches are giving you the best results so far with the Andromeda update?
[6.10.25, 15:54:26] ~ Adam Ashe: I used to get months out of a winning ad - now it’s like 5 days. Anyone else seeing this issue?
[6.10.25, 16:02:03] ~ Adam Ashe: Video ad ⬆️ this is
[6.10.25, 16:11:00] Barnabás: Hey guys! What do you think? Which AI gives the best translations in your experience?
[6.10.25, 19:32:34] ~ James: ‎Victor added ~ James
[6.10.25, 21:06:49] Malachi: has anyone figured out the best way to prompt SORA 2 for testimonials and actual scripts with shots?
[6.10.25, 23:13:26] ~ Austin: Who’s heading to the Elite Mastermind next week?

I’m opening my Airbnb for 2–3 other operators to stay with me to create a small group focused on maximizing the impact and takeaways from the event.

Did the same for the Dubai event and it turned out to be one of the best parts of the trip. The after-hours strategy sessions, shared insights, and lasting connections were just as valuable as what happened inside the room.

If you’re doing at least $500K+/month and want to stay with other serious players, DM me for details.
[6.10.25, 23:49:06] ~ Austin: *preferably 500K+ Months, but I understand everyone has value to provide, feel free to DM.

[7.10.25, 18:14:30] ~ David B: Amazing turnout today thanks to everyone who was on the call. 

Here is the presentation as promised > https://www.canva.com/design/DAG1C5AURAc/JTzPHewOCZbki46-Nr8GLA/edit

Here is the "get Toby" swipefile from the last few weeks. https://www.gettoby.com/p/033jzd4zxdwl
[7.10.25, 18:42:51] Matán Intsuper: If you sell on Shopify, but you want to create an advertorial that's coming from a different domain, is there a solution to do that on Shopify or you need to create the advertorial on Funnelish? Or is there any other better option? Thanks :)
[7.10.25, 20:38:54] ‪+1 (831) 331‑6717‬: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ‪+1 (831) 331‑6717‬
[7.10.25, 22:22:46] ~ Kevin Krieg: Just use funnelish for that, its way better for third party advertorials than shopify. Or funnelish alternative ofc like clickfunnels etc
[7.10.25, 22:54:40] ~ Carter Mac: Hey everyone, with GPT 5 out is Claude still the standard for copywriting? Or is anyone using GPT 5 instead, ive been having mixed results and curious on you guys experiences.
[7.10.25, 22:56:21] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Gpt is much better then before but still Claude better in my experience
[7.10.25, 22:57:16] ~ Jacob: Gemini
[7.10.25, 22:57:19] ~ Jacob: 2.5
[7.10.25, 22:57:33] ~ Jacob: Very good
[7.10.25, 22:58:00] ~ Jacob: Claude 4 is better than the new one
[7.10.25, 22:58:24] ~ Jacob: Gpt need a lot of instructions until u get good result
[7.10.25, 22:58:58] ~ David B: Claude is better than GPT for copywriting but you have to tell it to be concise or it'll write you an essay every single time. 

Gemini is showing promise but they key to any of these tools is having very good prompts, examples, and custom chats.
[7.10.25, 22:59:10] ~ Jacob: According to gpt there is no good solution for that in shopify, just to design the page as it from another website
[7.10.25, 23:00:03] ~ Jacob: u can use google ai studio to use the temprature and creativity for more accurate results
[7.10.25, 23:42:38] ~ Jacob: I dont know i dont invest to much in gemini promts and still pretty good results, of course being more concise will help but even with pretty basic promts its works good for me
[8.10.25, 0:55:43] ~ Austin: For my products / brand I personally prefer GPT
[8.10.25, 2:56:22] ~ Lauren: Does anyone have a good video editor for social / ads? That isn’t wildly expensive?
[8.10.25, 3:58:43] ~ danny: my incognito isnt working for this and i rn outta credits lol is there a better way ‎<This message was edited>
[8.10.25, 4:40:32] ~ danny: nvm vpn and incognito work
[8.10.25, 5:41:10] ~ Mike Ramsey: 🚨Hey guys - many of you have MIDs at Reach that me or Matt have set up for you when we worked there.  We’ve received word today from their new board that they're purging their high risk porfolio, which some of you in this group fall under. 

If you have a MID with Reach feel free to DM and I will let you know if you are on the list and can help set up new MID’s so your Q4 isn’t compromised.

Not a good situation, but there are alternatives as things keep changing with VAMP and the tighter requirements with chargeback / fraud ratios.
[8.10.25, 9:02:45] ~ Casper: Hey everyone, I’m Casper.

I own a natural hair loss brand from the Netherlands. We produce science-backed serums with stem cells  that we produce ourselves. 

Would be dope to connect with other entrepreneurs / brand owners who are also in Bali atm.
[8.10.25, 15:29:32] ~ Иса: Hey 


Quick Q: Anyone running a quiz funnel (like Hormozi-style diagnostic)

 where you collect card details early (vault without charging)

 for one-click upsell at the end?

 If yes, love recs on app or custom setups—how's conversion/trust handling?
[8.10.25, 16:11:11] ~ Austin: Hey guys for a post purchase checkout champ VSL what software do you guys use to host the video? Vimeo? YouTube? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.10.25, 16:12:47] ~ Luka: We don’t use checkout champ, but I think you’ll find this very valuable to get more people to watch your videos: https://www.vidalytics.com/
[8.10.25, 16:15:57] ~ Austin: Killer, thanks man
[8.10.25, 17:29:39] ~ Hunter Davenport: Hey guys, I woke up this morning and the add to cart button on my pdp just straight up isn’t working. Not entirely sure what the hell happened. I didn’t make any changes or start using any new apps. Lmk if any of you have experienced this or know of a quick fix so I can turn my ads back on!
[8.10.25, 17:56:49] ~ Mark: Kaching apps were lagging for me too this week
[8.10.25, 18:47:23] ~ Cocow: Custom code your bundle. It costs but then you really on no one
[8.10.25, 18:54:19] ~ Hunter Davenport: That’s what I’m using too but I’ve been using it for months no issue.
[8.10.25, 19:01:34] ~ Idan Gabbay: ‎~ Salma Jimenez added ~ Idan Gabbay
[8.10.25, 20:19:14] ~ B.A.: Same

[8.10.25, 21:49:47] ~ L: How do you understand if it’s a kaching bundles issue or not?
Yesterday road 3+ today 1.9 but nothing changed

Anyone knows how to be sure ? ‎<This message was edited>
[8.10.25, 22:14:10] ~ danny: is kaching cooked ?
[9.10.25, 2:58:42] ~ Santi Roa: Hey bro! This call is every other week (twice a month)
[9.10.25, 13:37:55] ~ L: Guys is Kaching Bundles working for you?
[9.10.25, 13:39:18] ~ Jakub: Works for me right now

[9.10.25, 18:09:41] ~ Jan: Hi everyone! does anyone have a reliable FB insider contact who can help recover profiles that are stuck in a checkpoint?
[9.10.25, 18:45:48] ~ Marc F: in what format do you guys do picture ads? we got recommended to do 9:16 but keeping everything important in 1:1. Is that the best way to do it?
[9.10.25, 18:46:10] ~ Luka: 4:5 & 9:16 for every ad
[9.10.25, 18:53:44] ~ Marc F: you post them in a carousel?
[9.10.25, 19:10:48] ~ Adam K.: @⁨~F⁩ when you upload 1:1 you have an option to replace media on 9x16 ( buton under 9x16 ) where you upload 9x16 version of the same ad :)
[9.10.25, 19:42:09] ~ Giovanni: Hey guys, my product has sizes and many people are buying the preselected size and after receiving it they say “I didn’t order this size, I need a bigger one … bla bla bla” 

Of course it’s not my fault but is there something I can do? They also see the size they have ordered in the confirmation email…
[9.10.25, 19:43:49] Malachi: I also have this problem
[9.10.25, 20:04:21] ~ Austin: I would suggest don't have anything selected and force it to be selected, for them to go to checkout page
[9.10.25, 20:04:31] ~ Austin: Thats what we do and rarely have that problem
[9.10.25, 20:04:56] ~ Austin: I use an app called globo product options to do it, if you can't already do it with shopify native
[9.10.25, 20:05:39] ~ Austin: We have A LOT more variants then anyone IK so thats why we use the globo product options app instead of shopify native variants selection
[9.10.25, 20:06:04] ~ Austin: You can do color swatches, size selection, custom fields....everything
[9.10.25, 20:07:16] ~ Austin: BUT it does NOT report to your inventory system and you should 100000% keep a very close eye on it for the first few hours / days / weeks to be sure it's reporting all the needed info for you to fulfil the order
[9.10.25, 20:09:47] ~ Giovanni: Mmm ok got you thank you so much. Does it work if I am currently using quantity breaks? I assume that it will replace it, but can I build a quantity break offer that is actually good looking ?
[9.10.25, 20:10:34] ~ John B: I also use the globo, for some products, I use the shopify variant selector on part of the option field and then globo for the rest so that the variant is connected to shopify but then all the other details (that are virtual) are connected. May not work the exact same way for your prod but the app is great.
[9.10.25, 20:10:37] ~ Austin: It's been a pain for us to deal with when trying to do bundles
[9.10.25, 20:11:09] ~ Austin: Would love to know how to do this, will have to get  a dev on it
[9.10.25, 20:24:28] Alex  Fedotoff: hey team! Won’t be able to make it today for our weekly call! Please hit me up directly with your questions so I can help you out!
[9.10.25, 21:41:53] ~ Cocow: Hello guys i hope you are well 🙂 

Any of you worked or is working with a GERMAN video editor that has room for work ? 

We are as well searching for a copywriter/creative strategist part time to help us expand the brand to Germany (handling ads A to Z with editor, doing voice overs, etc…) 

Thanks a lot

[10.10.25, 1:07:19] ~ L: Guys anyone here is following Nick Theriot’s FB ads strategy after andromeda?
It’s been weeks since I can’t fcking beat the top spender 

I’m starting to hating that Ad 😂
[10.10.25, 1:44:35] ~ Kevin Krieg: yea, no problem here after andromeda. no real changes when it comes to finding/beating winners tbh
[10.10.25, 7:36:54] ~ seth: hi guys, I just start using Funnelish again today, but new update is a bit overwhelm, anyone have a share link of a funnel that alr have a good layout?
[10.10.25, 9:38:08] ~ Cocow: I know what you mean … maybe but minimum spend on each adset or move promising ads to a single abo adset to give them more room and grow interactions etc …

[10.10.25, 14:17:22] ~ Jakub: Have you guys changed your media buying strategy after the Andromeda update? I have been running "standard" ABO test, then scale in CBO with each ad having its own adset. My CPCs were going up consistently over the last few weeks. Should I change the structure or just run more ads?
[10.10.25, 14:57:50] ~ Moh: Hey ESS have anyone experienced listing their products on GPT after the Shopify GPT shopping integration?

[11.10.25, 4:18:24] ~ Layton: duplicate product, use ABConvert to do a URL split test. let it run for minimum 7 days
[11.10.25, 4:19:37] ~ Casper: Nice. Will this cause issues when it comes to fulfilment? I work with master SKU's, will that automatically be adjusted/taken over?
[11.10.25, 4:32:16] ~ Layton: No you need to let the people know who handle fulfillment about the split test
[11.10.25, 11:41:54] ~ Sonu Duhra: Hey guys, do you toggle on engaged view attribution or leave it off?

[12.10.25, 19:41:14] ~ John B: Does anyone have a good recommendation for where I can buy a FB business manager + ad account from?  Spend limit is not an issue I won’t be spending much to start
[12.10.25, 20:03:19] ~ Num: Hey everyone! When you move your winning Facebook VSLs over to YouTube, do you stick with the same format or tweak it for YouTube’s aspect ratio?
[12.10.25, 20:03:47] ~ Barnabás: Yo guys! I wanted to ask what you think about Meta’s AI image generation feature, you know when you upload a picture to a campaign and it offers AI-generated variations of that image. What’s your opinion on it? Do those usually work well for you? Do you ever pick a few of the generated versions, or do you usually just skip them? What kind of experiences have you had with it?
[12.10.25, 20:14:32] ~ 👀: Yes
[12.10.25, 20:16:32] ~ 👀: https://www.lott-agency.com/

[12.10.25, 20:18:23] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: What's their cost ?
[12.10.25, 20:18:41] ~ 👀: Used icon for ai ugc And stratics 👌🏼

[12.10.25, 21:25:30] Topi: We’ve done, not sure how accurate but at least after the testing the store scaled so in kaching spirits we trust  

Only done this couple of times tho
[12.10.25, 21:31:19] ~ Hunter Davenport: 😂 fair enough

I know this is a bit of an unusual request when it comes to product sourcing, but I’m asking on behalf of a friend. He’s looking for a sourcing agent who can help produce custom-made electrical items—things like outlets, covers, switches, and that sort of gear.

If anyone here has any contacts or recommendations in that field, it would be super helpful! Thanks a lot!

They are growing really fast in their company and want to custom products
[13.10.25, 18:47:59] ~ Mark: Hey guys my kaching cart/bundle is still bugging, it’s adding thousands worth of more products into customers cart and it significantly hurts the CVR.

Anybody else experiencing similar? 

And please let me know if you have any suggestions on how to fix it.
[13.10.25, 19:01:19] ~ Cocow: Reach to Support !!

Or
- ⁠other app
- ⁠Custom code
- ⁠Or try just for now maybe to duplicate your offer an save into katchin and go back to something without katchin while you are correcting the issue with support. 

Idk what is happening but a lot of people met issues with this app these days haha

What are my options?

I do have a an independent stripe account not sure how to connect it to shopify though? 

Any pointers will be helpful
[14.10.25, 23:16:23] ~ 👀: You Can connect stripe with Shopify with stripe app, but dont know if your url is flagged cause Shopify payments is also stripe
[14.10.25, 23:16:57] ~ 👀: Mollie payments we have Here. Dutch company
[14.10.25, 23:17:56] ~ 👀: But think first you need to fix the problem why is your chargeback rate to hight otherwise you Will get the same problem
[14.10.25, 23:18:28] ~ Drew Cable: What country Farhat?
[14.10.25, 23:18:41] ~ Farhat Godil: It’s the people subscribing and forgetting to cancel before renewal even after reminders and cancellation link provided everywhere
[14.10.25, 23:19:14] ~ Farhat Godil: I am in USA - but also sell in EU, CA and AU
[14.10.25, 23:19:18] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: You should use a chargeback softaware to be able to refund before the charge back reach your payment processor
[14.10.25, 23:19:43] ~ Farhat Godil: Can you share the name please for future
[14.10.25, 23:19:56] Topi: Change store country to some country that does not have shopify payments and plug in stripe, then you can change store country back to your own country

The chances of getting banned in stripe too is high because shopify payments are powered via stripe

But thats how you connect stripe if you want to try
[14.10.25, 23:20:39] ~ Farhat Godil: I couldn’t find the stripe app in App Store though. 

Is it an independent app?
[14.10.25, 23:21:00] ~ Drew Cable: Shoot me a message and I can connect you with some people.
[14.10.25, 23:21:11] Topi: Not an app

its from “payments” or “payment methods”
[14.10.25, 23:21:17] Topi: store settings ->

[14.10.25, 23:23:51] Topi: Because your country has shopify payments, it doesn’t show. Re-read my previous message to get it shown
[14.10.25, 23:23:59] ~ Farhat Godil: Oh k
[14.10.25, 23:35:20] ~ Farhat Godil: Worked thank you so much 😊
[14.10.25, 23:35:46] ~ Farhat Godil: Should I change back to my original country? Or leave as is @⁨Topi⁩
[14.10.25, 23:37:43] Topi: I’d change back

But what I mentioned before, due to stripe and shopify payments are pretty much the same thing, there’s high chance you wake up stripe being banned also 

And even if that doesn’t happen, if you don’t fix the root cause it will eventually happen
[14.10.25, 23:37:54] Topi: This also might be against shopify TOS
[14.10.25, 23:39:47] Topi: Once you’ve fixed the root cause, the chargeback issue, better idea would be applying for other processors such as mollie, airwallex and many other alternatives
[14.10.25, 23:54:16] ~ Farhat Godil: + they have held mine 15k payout supposed to come out today for at least 6 month not sure if anything can be done for that? ‎<This message was edited>
[15.10.25, 1:04:32] ~ Mark Wagner: If it's been over 6 months it's typically illegal for a processor to continue holding your funds. I'd recommend reaching out to https://www.compaytence.com/ they help merchants get holds released
‎[15.10.25, 1:27:36] ~ Steph: ‎image omitted
[15.10.25, 4:02:18] ~ Farhat Godil: How do we retain current subscribers? Does moving them to a new platform with new payment gateway work automatically?
[15.10.25, 4:16:01] ~ Santi Roa: What’s your chargeback rate?
[15.10.25, 4:21:31] ~ Farhat Godil: It’s at 4% but that’s due to currently little less sales as compared to before
[15.10.25, 12:40:33] ~ Santi Roa: Okay but anyways it’s crazy high you will have problems with any payment method
[15.10.25, 12:41:06] ~ Santi Roa: Why so many? Is it the product bad? Were customers asking for refund and you didn’t give it?
[15.10.25, 12:42:08] ~ Santi Roa: Just for benchmark, my chargeback rate is between 0.25% and 0.38%
[15.10.25, 12:43:26] ~ Santi Roa: Of course it wasn’t been like this at the beginning. We slowly improved the product, logistics, and support
[15.10.25, 12:44:20] ~ Santi Roa: I mean: Don’t be discouraged but at least know that what you have is a symptom of something bigger. Don’t just switch payment methods otherwise the problem will reappear somewhere else

Try to find the root cause, then solve it ‎<This message was edited>

[15.10.25, 13:22:46] Matán Intsuper: mine is 0.23%. 4% is our refund rate not chargeback rate. also payment processors are now removing the threshold for chargebacks from 1% to 0.5% (and they will force us to use their dispute prevention tools)

Cheers
[15.10.25, 17:59:22] ~ Akshay: Hey all, been having an issue with meta just not tracking our sales over the last year, for ex. if we have 30k sales, only about 5k is attributed to meta but we know meta is where majority of sales are coming from because when we turn off meta ads the sales go down as well. We've tried every tracking software there is - hyros, converge, we tracked etc nothing seems to make a difference. Has anyone experienced a similar issue?
Our current hypothesis is that it may be some kind of tracking/code issue -- if anyone knows a developer that can fix this please let me know!
[15.10.25, 18:04:28] Matán Intsuper: Shopify or Funnelish?
[15.10.25, 18:05:00] Matán Intsuper: Have you tried to contact the support of those tracking platforms to help you figure out the discrepancy?
[15.10.25, 19:49:34] ~ Akshay: Shopify
[15.10.25, 19:50:35] ~ Akshay: Trying that now - they are saying their software is working fine but still looking at what it could be
[15.10.25, 19:50:54] ~ Cocow: 1. Clean the code of sour theme and make sure you do not have multiple tracking solutions 
2. ⁠make sure your pixel is not categorized as health 
3. We use bily , and working great for us so far 

I think a theme cleaning is necessary
[15.10.25, 20:01:09] ~ Alessandro: Hi guys

[16.10.25, 11:39:35] Carlos Leeseman: Yes, but after Andromeda focus on bigger swings, like variations, diversity, etc
[16.10.25, 11:40:01] Carlos Leeseman: But you can still do hooks and leads of course, but don’t micro iterate anymore, like changing music, scrollstoppers, etc. Doesn’t matter anymor e

How do you sell 2 different brands on Amazon? Do you use 2 different companies to create two different Amazon seller accounts?

[16.10.25, 19:43:01] ~ Giovanni: PayPal is currently having issues and it’s not available at the checkout. Should I put a banner telling this or it’s better to not? ‎<This message was edited>
[16.10.25, 20:02:02] ~ Giovanni: Never mind it works again now
[16.10.25, 20:52:01] ~ Pawan: I had a questions about interests! 

I have one ad set which I’ve increased the budget by 25% after consistent performance and gave me good roas and overall metrics. 

Along with this I only have one more adset in the ad account that’s new and running, the other adsets around this creative were just killed due to poor metrics in the first 18 hours. 

I want to ask tonight I’m adding 2 more creatives to the ad account, should they be under the adset that’s working duplicating that as it’s a interest which is working well, and for the other adsets which are off I shouldn’t duplicate those right? And should I try more broader or different larger interests? And make a completely new ad set for 2 creatives? So 1 which is working I duplicate that and 4 other with new interests? 

Along with this the creative that’s performing the best should I also test that with new interests?

This is my first test ‎<This message was edited>
[16.10.25, 22:15:28] Malachi: Why are you interest testing?
[16.10.25, 22:15:32] Malachi: Just curious
[16.10.25, 22:16:34] ~ Pawan: I just joined the mentorship so Im using methods taught in BBA for testing
[16.10.25, 22:23:14] ~ L: Guys I have 1 CBO Campaing that I’m scaling 20% every profitable day - 
I’m not in a rush to scale with this brand 
I launch every week 2/3 new VSLs inside a new Adset  
Roas has always been between 2.2 and 3.1 
but it’s been 3 days now that the ROAS dropped to 1.2 
Is there anything that might be the cause? Nothing really changed, my top spender VSL’s Roas dropped from 2.5 to 1.3 

Since it’s been a month now with this brand I thought maybe feedback score hit. But i don’t really know if it’s still a thing since it looks like it doesnt’ update anymore 

Anyone got any idea? ‎<This message was edited>
[16.10.25, 22:56:39] ~ Farhat Godil: What are checkout champ alternatives which we can move to with a current subscriber base? 

Something that would mimic shopify to not hurt conversions
[17.10.25, 2:40:22] ~ Casper: Hey guys. Just checked out a video from Alex Fedo about diversity in ads with this new Andromeda update. Basically saying that the algo punishes you if you launch ads that look very much the same. What if I launch the same (or similar ads) to test which landing page converts best? Will that also be negative for performance?
[17.10.25, 2:41:33] ~ Farhat Godil: Where is it posted?

[17.10.25, 10:50:50] ~ seth: Guys anyone still using funnelish? I have a question, when I checkout with paypal option on checkout champ it's not require to fill information and go directly to Paypal page, but funnelish require to fill the customer's information even when select checkout with paypal. My question is does this affect the CR of checkout page?
[17.10.25, 14:05:21] ~ L: Guys performance dropped suddenly after 1 month of running ads for this brand.
Nothing changed
What can be in your opinion ?

[17.10.25, 14:33:53] ~ Cocow: And then sure if you sold a new product really special that is not evergreen there can be other issues
[17.10.25, 15:27:40] ~ B: Hey guys

📹 We are planning to do our first “studio” batch shooting with 5 different actors/models for our jewelry brand » mainly for video ads for q4 for different products we have.

We want to create scripts / setups that are modular as well, but kinda lost in this process, how to prepare everything to be as efficient as possible » regarding ideas, scripts, videographers, actors etc.

Anyone have done a big shooting like this or an expert at creative sourcing and prepartion?

Would be appreciated 🙏🏼
[17.10.25, 15:44:17] ~ L: I had 1 winning VSL for 2 weeks now - from 3 Roas to 1.2 overnight (literally) 

Since it has been one month of running Ads with that page I thought it was the feedback score that hit - dont’ you think?
[17.10.25, 16:35:20] ~ 🥇: Hey guys , is there a way to pay supplier with card to get cashback ‎<This message was edited>
[17.10.25, 16:36:13] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Pay through Alibaba
[17.10.25, 16:37:06] ~ 🥇: How as he told me they are charging hin high fees for that
[17.10.25, 16:37:27] ~ Luka: Alibaba charges additional fees for every transaction via card or other methods
[17.10.25, 16:39:13] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: They are not that high, and also you have at least a protection in case there is a problem you can get refunds
[17.10.25, 16:39:50] ~ 🥇: How much fees ?
[17.10.25, 16:41:55] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: 2.9%
[17.10.25, 17:52:25] ~ Cocow: Don’t rely on one VSL cause one day or another this will go down so keep launching ! 

It can be : 
- bad comments on the ad breaking everything 
- ⁠increase of cpm/cpc so less clients Thant before for same money so roas drop 
- ⁠Your page flagged yes , but check your score probably not the problem 

Sometimes it just happens that the creative goes down unfortunately 

If this is a VSL try to do a UGC hooks+ lead 1 minutes before the VSL , this has been one of our biggest winner and quite easy to do , even with ai on a selfie mode. Try this with 2/3 avatars this can really give a second chance to your VSL 

Just iterating hooks now , I am not sure nowadays if this still makes sense because of new algo but giving a fresh UGC lead can really be good
[17.10.25, 20:57:15] ~ Jacob: Hey guys in the usa, how much u let adset run until u turn it off? For testing purposes , and whats ur minimum testing budget?
[17.10.25, 22:26:21] ~ Jacob: Guys anyone have insider in triplewhale?
[17.10.25, 22:27:02] ~ Cocow: Insider at TW ? To spy ? 😅
[17.10.25, 22:28:26] ~ Jacob: Nooo
[17.10.25, 22:28:34] ~ Jacob: Technical support
[17.10.25, 22:29:03] ~ Jacob: Have some problem and they are not very helpful
[18.10.25, 1:22:41] ~ Cocow: Support they should be quite responsive never had issues but for sure you may not get 1 hour solving team haha
[18.10.25, 11:26:24] ~ B.A.: Start cancelling subscription, then before the final option, you get the offer to get a call to keep you on board. In this final call you get all the support you need in order to keep you subscribed
[18.10.25, 11:44:01] ~ Ariel Gaona: Any access to meta insiders?
[18.10.25, 11:44:06] ~ Ariel Gaona: to help with blocked ad accounts or dmca issues?
[18.10.25, 11:47:49] Topi: yes
[18.10.25, 11:56:43] ~ Ariel Gaona: Hey bro how can I get access to them
[18.10.25, 22:28:20] ~ L: Guys is there still a spending limit for new BMs (it was like 47$)?
[18.10.25, 23:20:41] ~ Erik: Yes there is. I had one. After 4 days it went up to 300 and after 7 days it got to 1600
[18.10.25, 23:22:05] ~ Giovanni: Guys, I used to receive at least 20-30 comments per day under my ads and now it’s 2 days that I don’t get any notifications from Facebook regarding comments. I’m sure that people are still commenting but why I’m not getting notifications? I don’t know how to check all the ads I have to see if there are new comments (I mean I know how to do that but it would be so time consuming )

I know there are softwares that track them but I’m just curious if I can fix these missing notifications
[18.10.25, 23:25:25] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey friends, 

Do anybody knows a way to temporarily accept payments just to  validate demand on my store? No llc and doesnt have stripe etc in my country

no matter the fees and everything- just untill fixing out some stuff i have with the proper payment processors while i cannot use them on my store ?
Just to not lose that inbetween time.
[18.10.25, 23:34:03] ~ Ariel Gaona: Bro ?
[18.10.25, 23:34:38] Topi: you can dm me for this type of requests
[18.10.25, 23:37:32] Topi: Just have everything normal, payment icons everywhere, but in checkout, they just cannot purchase

At least you get an idea of your add to cart rate and how many people proceed to checkout. That should give you an idea if this is going to work or no. 

We just validated like this, 10% add to cart rate on V1 page and mvp ads was enough proof
[18.10.25, 23:51:12] ~ Cocow: Meta business suits you will see them
[19.10.25, 0:03:59] ~ Giovanni: Oh nice thank you
[19.10.25, 1:24:05] ~ Carter Mac: does anyone know an app for generating comments on your facebook ads?
[19.10.25, 1:26:45] Topi: there is no app for this 

You can buy some blackhat services or create some sort of inhouse team but honestly just put that time something more important
[19.10.25, 1:27:32] ~ Carter Mac: ok got it, thank you
[19.10.25, 17:05:05] ~ Marc F: I got that message on the pixel “this website is in a category with restrictions”, and in category is health and weallness. Is there any way to get out of there? And how does this affect performance?
[19.10.25, 18:02:46] ~ L: I’ve heard people talking about this for the past 3 months almost- haven’t really understand how it effects the performances, it’s like this for a couple of months for me and nothing really changed 

I can still choose Purchase as an event
[19.10.25, 18:13:29] ~ Marc F: ok perfect, thanks
[19.10.25, 18:14:26] ~ Marc F: we are planning on launching two days per week. Is there any two days in particular we should pick? for example monday and thursday? or it doesnt really make any difference
[20.10.25, 8:28:35] ~ Casper: Hey everyone. Im currently only running FB ads in the Netherlands but want to expand. Thinking of belgium, germany and nordics. What is a smart move to do? Take my winning creatives, setup international campaign (per country or all the earlier mentioned countries in the same campaign?) one adset with all the ads. Either translated to English or translated to each specific language..
[20.10.25, 10:10:41] ~ Alessandro: Hi guys
Someone that have relay bank and is experiencing issues log in the bank?
[20.10.25, 10:12:50] ~ Mark: Interested in that too
[20.10.25, 10:19:35] ~ L: Sometimes I notice the day we launch new ads are the most instable, both way better or way worse results.

So “in protection” of my best performing days I would publish my new ads on Monday/Thursday 

I’m publishing once every 2 weeks
[20.10.25, 16:55:43] Suyi: Hey @⁨~Giovanni⁩ yes I’ve noticed this too with my Facebook , not sure why it’s happening but you can go to professional dashboard section and still see them , also would reccomend using moderation assistant on fb to automatically hide bad comments with certain keywords , this has helped me

You can also run opt-in emails to your list to get "early access" to BF and CM deals. 

And consider doing custom pop-ups and custom abandon carts for however long you are running your BFCM offer.

See you there!
[22.10.25, 17:13:53] ~ Giovanni: What you guys do when you reach the maximum number of ads for a single page?
[22.10.25, 17:14:17] ~ L: Create a new page
[22.10.25, 17:15:46] ~ Giovanni: Should I create a page that looks exactly like my current one?
[22.10.25, 17:17:10] Carlos Leeseman: We have multiple pages.
- Brand page
- ⁠Doctor Page
- ⁠Random person (Target Avatar)
- ⁠Magazine
[22.10.25, 17:17:12] Carlos Leeseman: This is something you can do
[22.10.25, 17:17:42] Carlos Leeseman: For branded ads use your branded page, for doctor ads use your doctor page, etc
[22.10.25, 17:17:43] Carlos Leeseman: Will increase results as well
[22.10.25, 17:17:55] ~ Giovanni: Makes sense thank you
[22.10.25, 17:18:50] ~ L: Why do you think this happens?
[22.10.25, 17:19:05] ~ L: And how do you use all the pages? In the same campaing?
[22.10.25, 17:19:13] ~ Mouss: Yeah a page par avatar is good! So you can scale each product with different marketing angle for a specific avatar
[22.10.25, 17:20:30] ~ Giovanni: How I know if the profile picture I choose resonates with them though haha? I think it’s just better for me to choose the right one since the beginning
[22.10.25, 17:22:02] Carlos Leeseman: Think from your customer’s perspective. If someone wants idk a painkiller, and sees a VSL coming from a doctor’s Facebook page, they’re far more likely to trust it than if it came from a random brand page. The credibility of the page or person behind the ad makes a big difference in how people perceive the message and whether they take action.
[22.10.25, 17:23:10] Carlos Leeseman: And if you have a product with multiple angles, for example back pain, then it’s makes a lot of sense to have a back pain magazine pain
[22.10.25, 17:24:01] Carlos Leeseman: And if you’re using a doctor/authority person in your advertorial or PDP, it will boost credibility as well if they’ve seen this name before in your facebook page and ad
[22.10.25, 17:25:13] ~ Giovanni: So if I find the winning doctor avatar I will use it as well on my profile picture of course
[22.10.25, 17:27:57] Carlos Leeseman: If a doctor makes sense for you, then yes
[22.10.25, 17:28:19] Carlos Leeseman: If you’re running beauty brand, then no
[22.10.25, 17:28:37] ~ Miika Tikkanen: Haven’t you guys seen that using doctors etc triggers the health claim issues with pixels?
[22.10.25, 17:28:46] ~ Miika Tikkanen: Facebook pixel issue
[22.10.25, 17:28:58] Carlos Leeseman: Not for us so far
[22.10.25, 17:31:35] ~ Miika Tikkanen: Even when you use words for health conditions?
[22.10.25, 17:32:24] Carlos Leeseman: I don’t know to be honest
[22.10.25, 17:33:04] ~ Giovanni: I’ve had some rejection in the past yes but not always. But no issues at all with the pixel itself
[22.10.25, 17:34:16] ~ Miika Tikkanen: Oh ok, because I have a health brand and my pixel got blocked due to using health condition words
[22.10.25, 17:37:58] ~ Giovanni: Oh really? Are you sure though? Meta told you that was the reason?
[22.10.25, 18:32:37] ~ Allen David Shor: Make sure to remove all medical terms from your landing pages and then request a review.
[22.10.25, 18:43:02] ~ Jeremy: Thanks, appreciate it
[22.10.25, 18:44:08] ~ Jeremy: Gotcha, thanks for sharing
[22.10.25, 19:24:43] ~ Giovanni: Regarding my last question, if I have a page that I’m not using now but I’ve run ads on, can I just change the name and profile picture and use it?
[22.10.25, 22:03:31] ~ Jacob: guys which ai tool are u using to upload ads quickly?
[22.10.25, 22:03:36] ~ Jacob: like a lot of adsets
[22.10.25, 22:20:33] ~ B.A.: kitchn
[22.10.25, 22:20:41] ~ B.A.: kitchnware.io
[22.10.25, 22:35:57] ~ Jacob: cool
[22.10.25, 22:35:59] ~ Jacob: i just made a trial there
[22.10.25, 22:36:07] ~ Jacob: need to learn how to use that i didn't completely undertand
[22.10.25, 22:37:47] ~ Colby: Is triple whale good for pixels ? Currently use wetracked but not sure what’s better
[22.10.25, 22:39:56] ~ Nicolas: wetracked is cheaper but takes longer to attribute
[22.10.25, 22:40:11] ~ Nicolas: but in the end they both do the same, just that wetracked is directly in FB ad manager
[22.10.25, 22:40:21] ~ Nicolas: whereas with tw you have to use their own dashboard
[22.10.25, 22:40:45] ~ Nicolas: with TW feeding data back to FB also costs extra money
[22.10.25, 22:42:32] ~ Colby: Do you need a higher plan or does it charge based off traffic
[22.10.25, 22:43:03] ~ Nicolas: i think you just have to pay extra or so, im not sure
[22.10.25, 22:43:22] ~ Nicolas: TW is not worth it IMO, thats why we changed to Wetracked
[22.10.25, 22:48:40] ~ Colby: What dashboard do you use?
[22.10.25, 22:51:36] ~ Nicolas: dashboard?
[22.10.25, 22:52:40] ~ Colby: Do you use true profit or something. Like triple whale has a dashboard to see net profit and cogs
[22.10.25, 22:53:06] ~ Nicolas: we switched to manual calculation
[22.10.25, 22:53:20] ~ Colby: Oh ok 👍
[22.10.25, 23:23:14] ~ 👀: ‎~ Barby removed ~ 👀
[22.10.25, 23:25:55] ~ James: Hey all, was wondering if anyone had a resource to acquire a hard cash loan ($10000 USD).

Looking to scale and am looking for capital for MOQ as well as increasing ad spend.

Would be willing to show everything on the front & back end to prove traction. 

Thanks a ton in advance
[22.10.25, 23:52:13] ~ Austin: Hey man idk much about loans but Shopify provides loans to their merchants
[22.10.25, 23:53:24] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: Paypal provides loans too if you have a good payment history with them ‎<This message was edited>

[23.10.25, 0:41:24] ~ Mark: Hey does anyone know an agency that can open up an Amazon seller account even if im banned there?

[23.10.25, 4:54:09] ~ Colby: Does anyone have an app that can force subscriptions. I’m looking for the app Mars men uses
[23.10.25, 4:54:59] ~ Colby: Just an add to cart button but it will auto subscribe. Trying to test out only subscription

Thanks 🙂
[23.10.25, 10:13:07] ~ B.A.: Is this legal?😜
[23.10.25, 11:39:26] ~ Num: Hey guys 👋
Anyone here using PayARC, EMS, or Safeweb (NMI) on Shopify?
Does the post-purchase upsell work with them or not?
[23.10.25, 11:43:58] ~ Amaru: I’ve been having some trouble with Funnelish when using geo-locations, especially with the Swedish Krona and Euro currencies. For context: a customer was able to check out using the Euro amount but pay in Krona instead, ending up paying around 5% of the actual price. Luckily it was not the other way around..
All my settings appear to be correctly configured, but Sweden is also the only geo-funnel not syncing orders to my Shopify store. Other geo-funnels are properly syncing.
Has anyone experienced something similar? I’ve wrote support many messages already but not getting any response, so I figured I’d ask here.
[23.10.25, 12:11:59] ~ Y: Can you send me checkout page url and customer email or id that faced the issue
[23.10.25, 12:15:52] ~ Jeremy: I heard good things about this but haven't tested it myself: https://www.amt.ai/
[23.10.25, 12:16:20] ~ Jeremy: Has anyone tested the new creative testing tool in meta? If so, how did you like it? ‎<This message was edited>
[23.10.25, 14:58:04] ~ danny: yea lol
[23.10.25, 14:58:16] ~ danny: just mean don’t have a 1 time purchase option
[23.10.25, 14:58:26] ~ danny: just a try it now refill every 30 days
[23.10.25, 14:58:29] ~ danny: not black hat lol
[23.10.25, 14:59:07] ~ danny: it’s not like i’m hiding the subscription

[23.10.25, 18:01:05] ~ Ziga: hi everyone! any good resources to hire EU UGC creators? There is a limited pool of creators for some of these smaller markets. 
Also, how do you guys handle getting unlimited usage rights? ‎<This message was edited>

[23.10.25, 18:18:19] ~ JB: Has anyone worked with a licensed Australia TGA sponsor in order to get help getting a AUST L number to sell your supplements in Australia?
[23.10.25, 18:21:41] ~ Wouter Akika: Hey Guys!

Looking for an intro to an enterprise stripe rep to move all low-risk multi-month rebills to stripe & beenfit from highest AR, does someone have a enterprise rep?
[23.10.25, 19:21:51] ~ Mark: Hey. Does somebody know a guy that checks if your website is safe from DMCA takedowns?
[23.10.25, 19:31:42] ~ Nuno: ‎~ Jacobo Uribe added ~ Nuno
[23.10.25, 19:44:36] ~ Jeremy: No
[23.10.25, 20:42:12] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Hey Wouter - happy to make the intro. I know several Enterprise Stripe reps. Feel free to DM me and I’ll make an email intro.
‎[23.10.25, 20:45:57] ~ Farhat Godil: ‎image omitted
[23.10.25, 21:34:13] ~ Mikael: Whats your best practice for high converting static ads? AI? Templates? What AI is best?
[23.10.25, 21:38:16] ~ Kk: Yes message me
[23.10.25, 21:39:13] ~ Kk: Find UGC creators groups on Facebook and post ads with criteria up for what you need
[23.10.25, 21:45:07] ~ Kk: (If admins allow) — they are my manufacturer for listing my TGA product
[23.10.25, 21:46:03] ~ Daniel: Fiverr also has a big pool, you can filter on country
[23.10.25, 21:48:05] ~ Ziga: yes, they do, a bit of a hit and miss. I've sourced a few, but the prices are high. Plus they want extra for lifetime usage rights / extended rights
[23.10.25, 21:48:24] ~ Ziga: tried that without much success
[23.10.25, 21:52:41] ~ Faizan: ‎~ Clara Busca Sust removed Faizan

[23.10.25, 21:51:33] ~ Ziga: more US based if I am not mistaken?
[23.10.25, 21:52:07] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: You can filter by country bu mt yes lots of americans there
[23.10.25, 21:58:52] ~ BG: ‎~ Clara Busca Sust removed ~ BG
[23.10.25, 21:54:26] ~ Kk: When I go on the TikTok search bar and type “UGC creators Europe”, all the videos under “top” — there are plenty of creators that have their emails in their bio. You can try reaching out to them individually?
[23.10.25, 21:57:09] ~ Jeremy: Icon has worked well for us

[24.10.25, 5:44:09] ~ Gabriel Cardoso: Guys do you know any shopify review app in which you can have reviews for different markets/languages, and then it would show up only the reviews of the customer market?
[24.10.25, 8:32:28] ~ Giovanni: As far as I remember if you have a translation app you should see with which review app it’s compatible for the translation
[24.10.25, 9:19:57] ~ Erik: Hi guys, is there anyone who has experience creating AI UGC with Arcads and want to share some knowledge that I can DM?
[24.10.25, 9:35:59] ~ Cocow: use loox, then it will translate all reviews based on ip addresse. Works really great.
[24.10.25, 9:53:27] ~ Luka: Do you know if Loox works for Shopify plus with multiple stores for the same brand ?
[24.10.25, 10:30:49] ~ Colby: About to run product test. 10 ads. 150 dsl. Would it be better to split it into 2 adsets in an ABO. Or 1 adset CBO
[24.10.25, 10:31:26] ~ Colby: i know abo is typically better for testing but I’m not sure what people do for low spend product test day 1
[24.10.25, 12:01:37] ~ Cocow: Every shop will have subscription but negotiate a bundle 

Then , as this is based on IP address you have zero problems 

You can put a language by default on each shop and/or translate automatically 

+ , they can enable for you in the backend sku review synchro. So based on your SKUs , they can sync the reviews across shops (chat with support)
[24.10.25, 12:03:32] ~ Eliezer Blas: Hey guys. A few weeks ago my brand got taken down and I spent a ton of money trying to save it. Unfortunately I didn’t. So now I’m back to testing products but I’m thinking of getting a job in the meantime while I test. Would you guys recommend a pay by hour job or a commission job? Any advice helps ‎<This message was edited>
[24.10.25, 12:04:09] ~ Cocow: Brand taken down ? For what reason ?
[24.10.25, 12:04:28] ~ Eliezer Blas: Payments got disabled and too many chargebacks
[24.10.25, 12:05:06] Topi: Your best bet is to learn an actual skill 

- video editing
- ⁠copy
- ⁠graphics
- ⁠etc etc


Very few people will hire for good money any general VA’s ”i can do anything”
[24.10.25, 12:05:54] Topi: But the moment you can in one word explain what you can do and show some sort of portfolio of your work 10x more valuable
[24.10.25, 12:07:06] ~ Cocow: Mmh shit , first understand your errors and avoid replicating them on your new testings :( 

Then you can still relaunch your product and creatives no on a different shop/ funnel ? You probably still have ad accounts etc … 

Careful because if taken down one time and you are flagged it can impact all of your future shops
[24.10.25, 12:11:01] ~ Eliezer Blas: Gotcha. Yeah what I’m saying is, for the meantime, to pay off my cards from what I used them for to try and save my brand, do y’all recommend a 9-5 job or a commission based job like car detailing stuff?  For context, I spent 10k+ on my credit card for ad spend and then the shops payments got disabled. So now I’m back to testing products but I don’t want to hit my credit limit and basically be in a much worse spot than what I am in right now . I hope I’m making sense.
[24.10.25, 12:13:21] Matán Intsuper: How did you try to save your brand by paying a lot of money?
[24.10.25, 12:14:39] Matán Intsuper: And if you owe money then you probably need to get a job but maybe someone here can hire you for eCom if there’s something specific you can do well (that won’t bring lots of chargebacks 😅)
[24.10.25, 12:16:16] ~ Eliezer Blas: I was getting sales but I had a backlog of orders so the refunds were countering the profit I was bringing in.
[24.10.25, 12:53:34] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey guys
 
From your experience does an llc name that is different from the brand name might cause issues/friction with meta/processors etc ?
[24.10.25, 12:56:22] ~ Ahmed HALKOUM: My experience with an ltd proves that it does not bother but I prefer tonhave the same name at the end
[24.10.25, 14:04:58] Matán Intsuper: No
[24.10.25, 14:49:25] ~ B.A.: With dropshipping, is there a way to not show the chinese label on the package?
[24.10.25, 14:50:53] Topi: Ask your 3PL remove it and replace with your stickers and packaging
[24.10.25, 14:57:18] ~ Mark: Hey. I’m looking for an agency/person that could help me hire more customer support Agents
[24.10.25, 15:10:42] Topi: dmed
[24.10.25, 16:43:12] ~ Cocow: Depends where you live cause freelancing if you have for example a specific expertise you can do good money , just have to put on the work and make more than what your clients expects 

Then once you have good cash , start testing again :)

How do you guys treat your CBOs? 
How many winning ads do you put into an ad set? 
Do you create a new ad set for each winning ad or cluster them together in batches?

[25.10.25, 1:06:12] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey 

Any reccomendation to which category of products sold should my llc be if im not yet locked on a specific niche for it to scale with ?
[25.10.25, 1:06:26] ~ Idan Gabbay: Can be pretty varied and dont want to lock in something specific right now, and picking something like health&wellness i afraid gonna be upfront flagged by meta and stuff
[25.10.25, 4:28:14] ~ Marc F: whats up legends. whats the best way to test new primary texts and headlines?
[25.10.25, 12:10:34] ~ Giovanni: Wdym? Keep the creative the same and change the text, you can do 4 at a time inside the same adset. On images you will get good results, on videos it’s harder, the video itself always makes the most of the job ‎<This message was edited>
[25.10.25, 16:34:34] ~ Giovanni: If I’m running ads from different pages, is it better to use one page per ad account or it doesn’t matter?
[25.10.25, 19:21:37] ~ Marc F: when you guys do videos with AI, do you remove the metadata?
[25.10.25, 19:37:57] ~ L: I usually use SORA as brolls for VSLs , never actually use an entire AI Video as ad 

So yes, everytime an AI content touches our ad account it’s always without SORA/FLOW/HEYGEN metadatas
[25.10.25, 19:38:36] ~ Marc F: what metadata remover do u use?
[25.10.25, 19:38:59] ~ L: Just export from the video editor
[25.10.25, 23:56:34] ~ Cocow: No matter
[26.10.25, 0:05:47] ~ Cocow: For a friend of my mine if by any chance: do you have a contact for removing Trustpilot reviews that works ?
[26.10.25, 14:34:16] ~ Mark: Hey, does anyone know insiders at Amex? Recently got a spending limit because I scaled too radically and I’m looking to release that limit or get a better card fast
[26.10.25, 14:40:04] ~ Nicolas: had that too, went away after some time of consistently paying off the card
[26.10.25, 14:40:28] ~ Nicolas: you can use transfers inbetween, it’s what we did
‎[26.10.25, 14:45:29] ~ Иса: ‎image omitted
[26.10.25, 14:46:11] ~ Mark: Directly into ad account ?
[26.10.25, 14:46:27] ~ Nicolas: no to amex
[26.10.25, 14:54:44] ~ Mark: I constantly paid of the credit on a daily basis. Also got the Amex bank acc
[26.10.25, 15:54:38] ~ Nicolas: it happened to us too even though we were paying off consistently ‎<This message was edited>
[26.10.25, 15:54:42] ~ Nicolas: but it will be lifted
[26.10.25, 15:54:48] ~ Nicolas: i recommend to give them a call
[26.10.25, 15:55:12] ~ Nicolas: and see if you can do anything, if not i can ensure you it will get lifted sooner or later after consistently paying off
[26.10.25, 16:00:13] ~ Marco: We had this lifted just talking to the normal platinum team with proof of sufficient funds. As I recall they needed 6 months of statements which likely doesn’t make sense for new brands with fresher accounts but may if you have a multi brand entity.
[26.10.25, 16:03:12] ~ Marco: In other cases the ramp up with extended limit was circa 7-10 days even without statements.
[26.10.25, 16:08:11] ~ Giovanni: With a 8% CTR Facebook is probably narrowing down a lot trying to get the perfect users for you so it’s normal that CPMs go up. However 230$ is a bit too high. In my opinion it’s because of your script or primary text, you could try using the same ad with a more broad primary text but usually it’s more the script
[26.10.25, 16:09:04] ~ Giovanni: Byw guys I’m opening a company in Hong Kong, any suggestions for the name? I don’t want to use my brand name
‎[26.10.25, 16:30:54] ~ Marc F: ‎image omitted

[28.10.25, 14:46:11] ~ Cocow: UGC or just creators ? Modash can filter i guess. Then you can surely search with filters + UGC hashtag or something

[29.10.25, 2:00:27] ~ Santi Roa: We spent a few thousands and performance was exactly as described by friends and mentors
[29.10.25, 2:00:51] ~ Santi Roa: Same with twitter ads, spent about 50k there but with a roas of 1

[29.10.25, 2:26:39] ~ Santi Roa: I think my team just learned through the applovin reps and trying out things last year
[29.10.25, 2:27:03] ~ Santi Roa: But overall the thing is don’t obsess over testing many creatives, follow their best practices and that’s it

One thing I’m noticing is that our ad account is basically full of VSLs and poor of creative diversity (in terms of concept)

Might the poor results be related to that ? 
Do I have to implement more images/testimonials/podcast ads etc?

I have launched a shop on three different markets. I would like to offer cash on delivery as a payment option on all of them. However, with the "manual payment method" solution, after placing an order, customers only see the price in the store's base currency and not in their local currency.

How can I make it so that everyone sees their order in the currency of their own country?

These are Eastern European markets and it works well with credit card payments, the problem only appears when somebody pays with COD
(CZ, SK, PL, HU markets and the base currency is HUF)

Maybe any of you faced with this problem before?
[2.11.25, 8:53:01] ~ Daniel Horvath: Maybe we should use an app to solve this?
‎[2.11.25, 10:43:15] ~ Alejandro H.: ‎image omitted
[2.11.25, 10:43:57] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys, anyone here tested both of those attribution models? Which one performs better in your case?
[2.11.25, 11:45:41] ~ Giovanni: Wdym? Where they see the price in the store currency? Order confirmation? Thank you page?
[2.11.25, 11:48:14] ~ Daniel Horvath: On thank you page and also when they choose COD they see this
‎[2.11.25, 11:48:19] ~ Daniel Horvath: ‎image omitted
[2.11.25, 11:57:22] ~ Giovanni: I see, and are you sure they only see this currency? Did you try from another country? I assume you did but if they still see that, it might be something that only reaching out to the support can solve
[2.11.25, 12:03:38] ~ Daniel Horvath: Yes, we tried with VPN and it is the same. Maybe we should try with bigger Shopify plan or something.

Anyways, we will to contact with the support
[2.11.25, 12:10:20] ~ Jake: Does anyone have a contact for getting around the VAT in the EU legally when shipping from China?

Or some advice how to structure that?
[2.11.25, 12:14:04] ~ Иса: Guys , if you would have $1 000 000 and more investment, what would you invest ? What category, what niche ?
[2.11.25, 12:14:51] China Bigboss: I know some one can help
[2.11.25, 12:16:46] China Bigboss: 40% Real estate 
40% AI automation and saas
20% Crypto 

It's not finance advice at all but this how I will do it
[2.11.25, 12:19:03] ~ Иса: I mean about e commerce
[2.11.25, 12:39:38] China Bigboss: Supplement 100% 
Or Create a new product 🔥🔥
[2.11.25, 12:40:06] ~ Giovanni: Guys, I’ve relaunched my product on Funnelish (before I was sending them to the PDP after the advertorial) and ROAS is 3 buy I only got one sale inside funnelish, they have probably closed the funnel and searched out for my brand on google and bought . Should I keep that adset on? Wouldn’t be profitable with only Funnelish sales
[2.11.25, 12:42:58] ~ Kan: May I ask how would you invest in AI automation and saas? Thanks in advance
[2.11.25, 12:52:29] China Bigboss: For example 
eCommerce	AI product description + ad generator + auto-sync to Shopify	Saves time and you can leverage from the monthly subscription
[2.11.25, 13:37:12] ~ Cocow: Has anyone a contact with a 3PL in china ? 

The goal is to have our own team for sourcing and product development and collaborate with a fulfilment center :) thanks
[2.11.25, 13:39:17] ~ Jake: Sent you a DM
[2.11.25, 13:41:17] ~ Moh: Hey sure will Send you a DM
[2.11.25, 20:28:58] ~ Giovanni: Do you guys iterate on non scalable VSL to try making them better and able to be scaled? Like new leads etc? Or usually it’s the body that decides if it’s scalable or not

[2.11.25, 20:34:03] Topi: Low average playtime, makes sales = test new leads

High playtime, no sales = iterate on body / mechanism 

Low playtime, low sales = dont bother iterating
[2.11.25, 20:36:12] ~ Cocow: 100% on lead 

- Authority lead 
- ⁠UGC lead 
- ⁠testimonial lead 

Try to create for 30sec-1min curiosity around your solution without mentioning 

At the end you say “but I have a friend that told me that this product made the difference” and then body 

Worked really great for you 

You can do multiple avatars , genders , etc ..
[2.11.25, 20:41:21] ~ danny: anyone know best platform for finding older male ugc creators ?
[2.11.25, 20:43:15] ~ Giovanni: If I’m right we want at least 10-15s average play time to say it’s good, right? 

Under 10s there’s a lot to improve and if it’s over 20s it’s probably very nice
[3.11.25, 6:19:11] Matán Intsuper: Hey guys. If u wanna test new concepts/products/brand do you open a new Shopify store for each test and payment processors etc? Or do u use some kind of test store/payment processors etc/landing page builder? I have bunch of new ideas I want to test but building a Shopify store and applying for payment processors each time is boring, also stripe is giving hard time when I open new accounts

[3.11.25, 13:32:45] ~ Cocow: Your CPMs are really high where do you sell ? 

This is really strong ads results , make sure your pdp is congruent , good offer or funnel cause these metrics on ad level are really good , just that CPMs are absolutely crazy this is a new ad account ? I see euro that is why I say that this is high CPMs for Europe I would say
[3.11.25, 13:33:22] ~ L: It’s US market / Health Niche
[3.11.25, 13:34:33] ~ Cocow: Ah Mmh , got it , then I cannot help 😂 But from my perspective this is really good results average play time for example
[3.11.25, 13:43:21] ~ seth: how did you solve it?

[4.11.25, 9:48:24] ~ Casper: Hey guys. Since andromeda. Do you all still test VSL's & 3+ different hooks? Or just one hook now and that's it.
[4.11.25, 10:21:48] ~ Ariel Gaona: Honestly based off everything mark has been saying about andromeda no more hook tests cus they’re all seen as 1 ad. I’ve been testing only 1 hook instead of 3 for the past week
[4.11.25, 11:08:21] Fabian: Anybody got a solution for skin care before and after with AI?
[4.11.25, 11:11:04] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey 
Does someone have good system/guideline to get/source/generate strong scroll stoppers ?
[4.11.25, 11:11:54] ~ Ariel Gaona: Get inspo on get hooked, 

Recreate with veo 3.1 or sora 2
[4.11.25, 11:12:37] ~ Ariel Gaona: That’s the easiest and best way to leverage ai right now and be able to generate a bunch of scroll stoppers especially when testing big swings
[4.11.25, 11:15:07] ~ Marco: RE this, are you creating completely unique ads end to end with Sora/Veo etc? Or finding a sweet spot of how much has to be unique?
[4.11.25, 11:16:36] ~ Ariel Gaona: Finding a sweet spot for sure. Using a mixture of ugc, b-roll, ai generated content, stock footage.
[4.11.25, 11:17:25] ~ Marco: Ok got it. So say, 100 different standalone assets, mixed in different permutations?
[4.11.25, 11:17:45] ~ Ariel Gaona: Test bigger swings for sure tho with andromeda. Do a little audit on your ads and see if they feel/look the same. If yes then you gotta test different concepts
[4.11.25, 11:18:22] ~ Marco: Ok got it. Ultimately the want the viewers to feel like it’s a unique ad…if it is, potentially ok.
[4.11.25, 11:18:29] ~ Ariel Gaona: Sure you gotta build an asset library for your brand so that your editors have a way easier time when trying to use all this
[4.11.25, 11:20:08] ~ Ariel Gaona: Yes even if it’s the same angle, for example “get rid of acne” can be done with 

Ugc (reaction story) 
Ai vo (explaining mechanism) 
Vsl 
Mini Vsl 
Text overlay w/ music (before/after)
[4.11.25, 11:20:27] ~ Ariel Gaona: Just some creative concepts that feel and look very different but they are targeting the same angle
[4.11.25, 11:20:47] ~ Marco: Perfect. Thanks man.

[7.11.25, 9:49:05] ~ Adam K.: I am not sure about tracking in triple whale ( its mainly for attribution without server side tracking? ). I switched from wetracked to upstack data. There is also aimerce. I would start with TW and ask if they can solve it. Sometimes funnelish needs additional tracking scripts
[7.11.25, 12:06:32] ~ Nicolas: we changed from TW to wetracked
[7.11.25, 12:06:56] ~ Nicolas: with TW you have to pay extra for sonar to get the data back to facebook
[7.11.25, 12:06:59] ~ Nicolas: it’s more expensive
[7.11.25, 12:07:12] ~ Nicolas: plus their tracking is strongly based on cookies
[7.11.25, 12:07:40] ~ Nicolas: so if you’re running eu and a customer declines cookies, this customer will automatically be not trackable with TW
[7.11.25, 13:01:15] ~ Adam K.: from what I know TW is modeling these "missing" sales then
[7.11.25, 13:03:00] ~ B.A.: Many big players use triple whale, are they all not tracking the right data in europe?

[7.11.25, 13:03:40] ~ Nicolas: they are inside the dashboard
[7.11.25, 13:03:49] ~ Nicolas: but they can not be attributed unfortunately
[7.11.25, 13:04:10] ~ Nicolas: they probably just make people auto accept cookies

[11.11.25, 12:31:54] ~ Sergii: it's not good offer. Can connect with Amazon certified agency that we worked with. Their prices are way lower

[11.11.25, 21:24:21] Yaniv: Sounds like rip off. Never give % of your revenue especially if you have organic sales coming (since you’re a DTC brand)
[11.11.25, 21:27:18] ~ Jacob: there is a lot of models...- you can also offer him a model if you dont like it and think what's the best for you -

here are few examples

A fixed monthly base for stability.

Plus, a management fee based on a percentage of the Amazon ad budget they manage (e.g., 5-10% of ad spend).

Works well when you want them to increase ad spend responsibly.

Inspired by general PPC pricing models. 
Click Click Bang Bang
+1

Base salary + bonus on revenue growth

Fixed base salary.

Bonus kicks in when overall sales/revenue via Amazon ads grow by X% compared to previous period.

Aligns their work with real business growth, not just clicks or spend.

Base salary + bonus on ROAS / ACOS targets

Fixed base.

Bonus when they achieve defined targets: e.g., ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sale) drops below 25 % or ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) exceeds 4×.

Good for focusing on profitability rather than just volume.

Revenue-share model (without big base)

Lower or minimal base salary.

They receive a share of actual incremental revenue generated by their Amazon PPC campaigns (for example 2-5% of incremental revenue above baseline).

High upside for them, higher risk for them, but strong alignment.

Flat monthly management fee + performance bonus

You pay a fixed monthly fee for all the Amazon PPC management services.

Then an additional bonus when KPIs are met or exceeded (e.g., new product launches, hitting 1M USD in ad revenue).

Provides predictability + upside.

Milestone payments

Define key milestones: e.g., launch new ASINs, get X reviews, hit Y ad impressions, reduce ACOS by Z%.

Pay bonus each time a milestone is reached.

Good when the role includes key project-based deliverables, not just ongoing operations.

Tiered bonus structure

Base salary.

Bonus levels tied to tier performance: e.g., if ad spend = $500k/year → bonus $5k; $1m/year → bonus $10k; $2m/year → bonus $20k.

Motivates them to move up tiers, not just hit one level and stop.

Profit share / EBITDA share

They get a fixed salary + a share of the net profit (or contribution from the PPC campaigns) after costs.

This model emphasises cost efficiency and focuses on real business profit, not just revenue.

Use when you trust your tracking and can isolate the PPC campaigns’ contribution.

Hybrid model: Base + % ad spend + bonus on KPIs

Combine multiple levers: moderate base salary, management fee based on ad spend, and bonus if KPIs like ACOS, ROAS, AOV (Average Order Value) are met.

Gives stability + scalability + performance orientation.

Long-term incentive / equity / retention bonus

For key PPC managers (especially strategic ones), include long-term incentives: for example, after 12 months of growth you get X% stake in new product line, or a retention bonus if certain multi-year targets achieved.

Good for locking in talent and aligning long-term interests.
[11.11.25, 21:28:07] ~ Jacob: you can choose a model you like it  and try to offer him and see what he thinks
[11.11.25, 21:28:17] ~ Jacob: i think revenue to it's not a good idea
[11.11.25, 21:45:20] ~ Akshay: Has anyone here worked with NIFT networks for their brand? If so did you see results?
‎[11.11.25, 23:10:47] ~ Chris: ‎image omitted
[11.11.25, 23:18:07] ~ Dryden Byrd: ask gemini
[11.11.25, 23:18:11] ~ Dryden Byrd: it can prolly do it
[11.11.25, 23:18:23] ~ Dryden Byrd: if I had to guess, or even the sidekick on shopify
[11.11.25, 23:29:23] ~ Igor Botelho: I’d run it as a test if I were in your position. ATC is a PDP behavior. When added to the homepage, it tends to mess up the data you feed your pixel. Just a thought
[11.11.25, 23:47:52] ~ Giovanni: Guys do you know if GemPages’ AI  can take my advertorial from Funnelish and recreate it ?
[12.11.25, 1:02:06] ~ Giovanni: Is 2k day too much for a new HK PayPal account?
[12.11.25, 3:20:05] ~ Drew Cable: Is it a brand new site or do you have processing history to justify the volume?
[12.11.25, 3:38:07] ~ Giovanni: I do have an history
[12.11.25, 3:40:26] ~ Drew Cable: You’ll more than likely still get a release amount at some point since it’s new but if the RA is too low reach out to support and provide your processing statements. That should validate volume/share of checkout.
[12.11.25, 3:45:29] ~ Giovanni: And another thing if you know it: if I change my payment processor with the new one from HK, is it going to be active right away or Shopify needs to approve it and there is some delay?
[12.11.25, 3:55:33] ~ Drew Cable: I’m not sure the ask. With PayPal you should just be updating the primary email address in Shopify and it’ll flow to that account. I deal primary US and Canada though so there may be some intricacies in Hong Kong I’m not aware of.
[12.11.25, 4:01:56] ~ Drew Cable: Feel free to reach out directly
[12.11.25, 10:40:29] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey 
I have a like organic memes instagram account ive planned on monetizing (havent had enough traction yet)

Anybody have experience with such organic accounts ?
[12.11.25, 13:30:07] Matán Intsuper: Guys what are you offering for Black Friday?

It was scheduled for 2:30 PM EST, which is *1 hour later than usual* for those of you outside the US, due to the daylight saving time change. I noticed it caused some confusion earlier with the VSL Domination call.

[14.11.25, 10:08:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Prevalidate your offer with a early BF sale, if the offer works, launch the BF campaign so it starts on Monday before Black Friday
[14.11.25, 10:09:10] ~ Giovanni: I wasn’t planning to change offer hahah but maybe I could lower the 3rd option by 10€ ‎<This message was edited>
[14.11.25, 10:09:36] ~ Giovanni: But I got you thanks
[14.11.25, 10:09:40] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Its mainly targeting engaged audiences/exisiting customers, who typically have seen your offer before
[14.11.25, 10:09:50] ~ Jeremy Leppink: so to be most effective, its good to give some additional discount
[14.11.25, 10:09:56] ~ Jeremy Leppink: or free gift (some incentive)
[14.11.25, 10:10:17] ~ Giovanni: Ok then maybe I could have a campaign only for engaged audience with the discounted offer
[14.11.25, 10:10:22] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Margin will be a bit less perhaps, but your CPA is going to decrease as well
[14.11.25, 11:11:41] ~ David Herold: Guys, I hear everywhere that with Andromeda I should run many different ads, different angles, etc … but in my adset FB typically chooses one variant and scales it, while the others have minimal views… does this happen to you too? How should I test other variations and angles?
[14.11.25, 11:24:31] Topi: CBO?
[14.11.25, 11:27:54] Topi: If yes from my experience it’s because your ads are hitting the same segment of the FB audience. FB only serves them the creative it sees performing the best. To break out this loop and to get multiple creatives to spend simultaneously, you have to diverse your creatives. The simplest way I can put is that as many creatives as possible should talk different segment of the available audience

Thanks guys !

We need to exchange about €500k per month

[17.11.25, 4:45:52] ~ Jake: Payouts are in EUR but ad spend is in USD

So just simply converting it from EUR to USD

Tomorrow's copy call is all about Listicles. 

Listicles are a style of advertorial that is massively under rated and hugely powerful when done right.

[18.11.25, 1:43:40] ~ David: Keep it one and use Translate and Adapt. Just keep an eye on the automatic translations so they don’t mess anything up. 

Using different domains for practically the same website can hurt SEO from what I’ve been told. You can still buy more domains once you get bigger and then forward them all to the main domain (.com most preferably).

[18.11.25, 10:52:59] ~ Num: Hey Guys anyone else seeing a ton of card declines on Shopify Payments lately?
I’m getting a lot of ‘card declined’ even when 3DS is passed.
Wondering if it's a descriptor issue or merchant profile thing. Anyone had this before?”
[18.11.25, 10:53:16] ~ Yusuf: Hey guys, does anyone know a trusted service where we can buy reviews for our Amazon products? I assume we'll still send product and pay for product and review
[18.11.25, 10:54:54] Marek Olszewski: when sending your product to ugc creators, you can have them buy from amazon, reimburse them outside of amazon and post reviews, just avoid sending links ‎<This message was edited>

Only thing I found out that it most likely has to do something with the link you put in. But no workaround to get it working.

[18.11.25, 22:56:54] ~ John B: I just had this and fixed it. Try starting a new adset from scratch instead of duplicating a previous one (which is what I would always do) and it may work. GPT said there was an update and duplicating old adsets would be trying to reupload old backend code or something. 🤷‍♂️
[18.11.25, 22:58:25] ~ John B: Same link, primary text, ad, headline etc only change was an ad set from scratch. If you want to keep the same adset it could work if you manually add a new ad instead of duplicating an old one.
[19.11.25, 0:47:51] ~ Cocow: Hi guys 

I have a friend that has been running a brand selling  some health gadgets  in US these past years and now he does not have the time to focus on it and optimize the funnel, etc…

They have 2 copywriters and 1 editor part time. They run mainly VSLs 

He wants to put the brand on track again and the goal would be to sell it during Q1. His target is around 500k 

He is entitled to give a percentage on the sales(10-20%) and a percentage on the monthly profit (20-30%). 

Nothing fixed yet but to give overall idea :) 

He is searching for someone with strong background ideally on health niche + us market 

If you feel you can fit , please dm :)
[19.11.25, 3:28:26] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey friends

anyone uses us payment processor without a physical us address ? 

Would really appreciate your guys take on that - wanna understand how stable is that and if i can rely on ‎<This message was edited>
[19.11.25, 5:30:51] ~ Jake: What is the best checkout customization app for Shopify Plus?

Is there any where you can have your own custom scripts?
[19.11.25, 8:07:23] ~ Colby: What’s considered a good churn rate
[19.11.25, 11:08:10] ~ Cocow: You have 

- Rebuy
- ⁠Shopify Blocks
- ⁠Aftersell

They all do kind of the same things. The best is to take the image section an do your images for USPS, testimonials etc.. Then upsells and crossells there is a bit the same everywhere. 

Aftersell you can do shipping insurance

Rebuy and Aftersell have shipping thresholds as well but not perfectly integrated with shopify markets, Aftersell for this is a bit better on my case 

And probabl other apps that i do not know. However, coding directly is a bit restrictive from what I know you cannot do a lot of things
[19.11.25, 11:42:57] ~ Robin Zi: Hey guys, 

we opened a new store and tested 2 products there already. 

What we noticed already on the first product was a huge discrepancy between the outbound clicks on fb and the actual sessions on our store, but there we thought maybe the product is just not good or so. 

But now we started ads for another product and the discrepancy appears again - fb metrics are looking really solid in terms of CTR, CPC and CPM but it seems that the people are not landing on our store. 

So just to give here an example for today fb shows 54 outbound link clicks and we are just having 15 sessions on our store. 

We are pretty confused as it feels like that something is wrong, anyone had this issue before as well and can tell what could be the issue? 

We are in this game a few years so regarding the pixel etc everything is setup correctly I guess.

In this period the average of CPM is so high in that niche. So it means that you have to check all funnel to see whole scheme.

[25.11.25, 23:35:27] ~ John B: How many visitors do you guys wait to reach when split testing price to make a decision?
[25.11.25, 23:38:19] Topi: Generally speaking any A/B tests you wanna run like 500 orders and 7 days at least, this has been serving me well

With small rapid decisions you end up turning off losing stuff at some point and then its really pain in the ass backtracking where the mistake was possibly made while performance tanks
[25.11.25, 23:38:58] Topi: Crazy fluctations and sudden spikes on variant A/B is a real thing and often what is leading by far in the beginning actually ends up losing
[25.11.25, 23:40:35] Topi: If youre running so little traffic you cannot get 500 orders in 7 days, just turn your new price fully live and see what happens. 

If you get instantly more profitable and offer scales, amazing

If nothing happens or bad results, just turn back old price
[25.11.25, 23:43:44] ~ MG Business: What offers have been working well so far in Q4 for you all? I’ve been running simple bundles, Black Friday/christmas obviously, and also seeing success with sending free downloadable pdf’s with their purchase ‎<This message was edited>
[26.11.25, 0:33:02] ~ David: yeah man especially on BF. We got our target ROAS and CPR, I got 4 different ad sets and surfscale them up or down accordingly. Lets say our target CPR is 10, if I see its at 8 I surfscale 20-25% every 2 hours. If it goes above 10 I let the algo develop a little bit because sometimes it takes time and the CPR drops naturally. If its staying above for too long: surfscale down slowly and most importantly introduce new Ads especially on BF/CM. For us it stabilzes quickly and we usually can scale up again the next day.
[26.11.25, 0:40:49] ~ Mathias Bo: Got it are there different ads per adset, or is it 4 times the Same adset ? 

And is there a scenario, where you Double down the Budget ? ‎<This message was edited>
[26.11.25, 1:41:13] ~ David: There are different tactics out there but we split it in: 

- Best Vids
- ⁠Best Pics
- ⁠Best Carousels
- ⁠Dedicated BF Ads (all formats)

Approx 10-15 Ads per Ad set, weakest ones get replaced for new ones. 

Interestingly, the metrics get better for all Ad Sets when we scale, not just the BF one. BF is where 50%+ of our budget goes but we can also surfscale the normal ads. 

This is perfect because after BF we can simply deactivate the BF Ad Sets without interrupting learning / performance of the other ones too much. 

We definitely double up in the beginning when we got low spend and an Ad Set is performing really well. Doubling down was never necessary because after time you get a feel for if you should give it more time or if it’s definitely too much spend for the current ads and can preemptively surfscale down. This way you don’t mess up the algorithm too much.  

If your metrics are off by 300%+ already you can definitely scale down faster though to not burn money. Definitely take a look at the ads though, often introducing new / better Ads for a new targeting group can all the sudden reduce CPR and allow scaling.

[28.11.25, 13:58:30] ~ L: but not much really - it’s 200€ campaign that spent 80€ for an offer we usually have 13€ CPA in UK
[28.11.25, 14:32:10] ~ L: Do you think increasing the budget would work ?
I made this campaign planning to surfscaling it this bfcm 
But if this is what happening I might as well increase the budget to 1k and leave it ‎<This message was edited>

[28.11.25, 17:22:08] Carlos Leeseman: Guys, our BFCM campaign is doing really really great today, we already scaled it this morning, now we want to surf scale it again. How much would you scale it? 20%? Double it?
[28.11.25, 17:31:31] ~ Santi Roa: We are surfing about 30% every 2hrs
[28.11.25, 17:31:41] ~ Santi Roa: So we 3x spend compared to yesterday

No emails or notifications from Meta. 

Meta support says that one of the admins has unpublished the page but we checked and no one did it (checked activity logs). 

Has it happened with anyone before? 😅
[28.11.25, 19:05:38] ~ Ewen Garrigue: Hey guys,

I’m having an issue with Revolut Business Bank and I’m hoping someone here might have some insight.

Basically, some of my transfers are being held for review. Support in the app isn’t really helping and I need to get this resolved quickl.

Does anyone here know the real fix, or have a direct contact / internal insight at Revolut who could actually push a case forward?

Any help would be massively appreciated. ‎<This message was edited>
[28.11.25, 19:42:31] Topi: Insider takedown, someone paid to insider

Or meta deleted your page for copyright stuff if you were ripping shit
[28.11.25, 20:09:32] ~ Hunter Davenport: For surf scaling on meta should we be looking at first click, last click, or triple attribution?
[28.11.25, 20:21:05] Marek Olszewski: Data comes too slow, look at your blended roas
[28.11.25, 20:21:23] ~ Adam K.: doing the same :)
[28.11.25, 20:24:35] ~ Akshay: how do you figure out which campaign is performing well or isnt based on blended roas without conversion data in ads manager?
[28.11.25, 20:25:21] ~ Hunter Davenport: So then you just scale everything if your blended ROAS is at target?
[28.11.25, 20:26:00] Marek Olszewski: You only scale your historically top performing campaigns in time increments eg each 1h + measure impact against blended roas ‎<This message was edited>

I hope you’re all crushing this BFCM!!! It’s going wild out here for our clients, too!

I need to skip today’s CRO call to ensure everything is delivered at excellence. 

On the same note, I’ll be in a training room the entire week next week, and get to skip Friday’s (the 12/05) call as well. 

I look forward to connecting back with ya’ll on 12/12 at 3 pm EST, so we can get your stores dialed in for the holidays and Q1! 

Please don’t hesitate to DM if anything comes up in the meantime.

[29.11.25, 23:39:11] ~ Oscar: Hi guys, nice meeting you all! Im just new here and I had a question about automating things and building a team of people for my brand.

I’ve set up a whole Trello board, click up calendar with tasks etc.

How do i go about finding the right people? Just upwork or you have other suggestions?

Thanks a lot
[29.11.25, 23:58:08] ~ Cocow: I would not build up a system before having the people , cause reality then is different
[29.11.25, 23:58:20] ~ Cocow: Focus on finding them before implementing all of this has
[30.11.25, 0:03:17] ~ Cocow: Then to find , I think here some have probably nice processes :) 

On our side, we send to upwork in fact but you can do meta ads or LinkedIn ads to a form

Then , you filter the form because you asked specific questions 

Then you do a group call with top 5/6 , 

Then you do 1:1 with the best 2/3 or less

Goal : filter fast , reduce time consumption and put people in the same call you will see the one that speaks too much , the one that cannot communicate good , the one who is shy but smart , etc …

And if you can do it for example video editors , hire 2 at same time , so that if one quits you have the other one , and he can train the next one for example 

That is what we have been doing , not saying best approach :)
[30.11.25, 0:06:31] ~ Oscar: Okay gotcha, so you run for example some ads on facebook or LinkdIn where the people submit a form with i assume questions about the job, seeing if they would be a good fit etc and than picking the top 5/6, do a group call.
than take top 2/3 and get on a call with those etc

The sign up form, where do you create that?
[30.11.25, 0:06:58] ~ Oscar: appreciate the feedback already!
[30.11.25, 0:07:04] ~ Cocow: Exactly 

Make it simple , Google form
[30.11.25, 0:08:15] ~ Oscar: Okay, thanks brother! the ads you run, i assume that's a leads objective?
[30.11.25, 0:09:06] ~ Oscar: any recommended budgets?
[30.11.25, 0:15:35] ~ Cocow: I am not doing it my self and cannot answer this 😅 

Meta , probably yes 

Linkdeing this is probably a special objective sorry cannot say 

As for budget , you can certainly have something for 20-50 a day , depends on how much time you have and what you want to spend
[30.11.25, 0:17:42] ~ Oscar: Okay no worries mate, already much appreciated and i'll be trying this for sure. 
Going to set up the google forms!

One more thing, when picking out the persons, what you typically look at or ask to know which person could be the highest change of being the right fit?
[30.11.25, 0:22:10] ~ Cocow: I would say , depend on what profile you need first cause you do not need a VA to be creative for example 

So make sure to ask questions relevant to the position 

Ask to make a loom to present them self and why they would be a good fit ( no loom = out) 

Ask their target hourly and monthly salary so that you can have an idea and you will see some people giving crazy prices 

Finally , make sure they take a bit of time to respond , not filing it with ai 

What has been really importent for us is the group call cause you can directly see who fits or not with you and the company
[30.11.25, 0:23:23] ~ Oscar: Okay thank you so much brother!

[1.12.25, 0:34:40] ~ Giovanni: What should I do if someone is selling my product on Amazon with my brand name and with some of my pictures? My name isn’t trademark or copyright registered though
[1.12.25, 0:45:45] China Bigboss: Hey bro you can report them directly to Amazon even without trade mark register 

You are the original creator of the images.
You are the owner of the product design.
You can prove the listing uses your photos, your brand name, your packaging
[1.12.25, 0:47:15] ~ Giovanni: Thank you. And which is the right channel I should contact Amazon on?
[1.12.25, 0:49:01] China Bigboss: https://www.amazon.com/report/infringement

Choose:

Copyright infringement

Image misuse

Or Brand misuse (passing off)
[1.12.25, 1:48:01] ~ L: Guys we have to save a client’s PayPal account that didn’t ship a few of orders 

Anyone here knows a supplier that can provide a few valid tracking numbers?
[1.12.25, 4:27:50] ~ Ariel Gaona: Hey guys, what is the best app you guys use for automatically handling chargebacks?
[1.12.25, 7:57:23] ~ Kim Romanov: You'd be wise to register that trademark ASAP, or someone else might beat you to it. We've been down that road before, and trust me, it's a whole lot easier to register initially than to deal with the hassle of suing someone later on.
[1.12.25, 8:15:37] ~ Adam Ashe: 1. Go to Amazon.co.uk/report/infringement
2. Start a report
3. Enter "the product number”
4. Tick all, select "Other IP Infringement" in report type
5. Brand , "your brand "
6. IP being asserted "Unauthorised use of our brand name and product identity (passing off / brand impersonation)"
7. More information :

"The listings in question are using our brand name “your brand” and copying our packaging design, product name, and marketing description without permission.

“Our brand” is a genuine, established brand actively trading via our official website “your website” . The infringing listing misleads customers into believing it is affiliated with our brand when it is not.

This constitutes unauthorised use of our brand name and product identity (brand impersonation / passing off).

Please remove or suspend this listing and prevent the sellers from using our brand name.

[1.12.25, 10:07:59] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey guys. How much do you pay for customer support? I currently have a head of customer support from Ukraine for $1k and we worked with several guys from Philippines for $600/mo but they aren’t really good.
[1.12.25, 14:11:30] ~ Giovanni: I have the same problem, I had to hire an Italian person because my brand sells almost only in Italy. But of course it’s more expensive. 
I would say that it’s good to have a nice guy as head of customer support who can also train the other guys.

So for example, you can keep the Ukrainian guy if he is very good and keep hiring people from the Philippines until you find one that you both like
[1.12.25, 14:40:31] ~ Santi Roa: Usually, you get what you pay for
My head of CX makes around 2.5k/month + bonuses
[1.12.25, 14:40:48] ~ Santi Roa: And my support agents make from 1.1k to 1.4k
[1.12.25, 14:40:59] ~ Santi Roa: We prioritize talent quality over spending a few hundreds more
[1.12.25, 14:41:53] ~ Santi Roa: But we are a big brand and been around the space for years. I’m just sharing so you have a perspective on what a good head of CX makes. In my case, she has 10yrs of exp, mostly managing teams and doing QA. She’s obsessed about Customer experience
[1.12.25, 14:56:07] Matán Intsuper: I pay the same as @⁨~Santi Roa⁩ but that’s because I have local agents for the market I sell to (and my customers appreciate that a lot). If id sell in English, I’d hire Filipinos for sure for around $400-500 per month full time ‎<This message was edited>

[1.12.25, 20:14:22] ~ Oscar: hi guys, when you hire someone for example a VA for copywriting/ scriptwriting. What do you give this person so he/ she knows exactly how to make high converting scripts? 

I'm struggling very hard with just knowing very well what my audience is and what they're looking for in my product. the main peole who buy from me are 50+ and men. but i cannot say properly what their pain points are, why they would wanna buy my product and just the details of that audience.

It's hard to hire someone if i can't explain to that person what they need to be aware of when creating scripts.

Of course i do know what the product solves as problem but that's really all. 
I don't have any competitors who run this product and the product is super niched which makes it hard to just find new ideas, understand the audience etc. 

This product has generated me a lot of sales so it's not a bad product i think.
Please can someone help me with just understanding your market, audience more.
[1.12.25, 20:14:37] ~ Damjan Topalovic: Backend is down
[1.12.25, 20:21:41] ~ MG Business: I don’t have any experience with VA copywriters but prompting ai for that stuff can get you pretty far if you have the time to do it properly
[1.12.25, 20:24:55] ~ Oscar: i work with AI now all the time but it still takes me a lot of time to find new script ideas.

Doing research into brands that are in the same niche doesn't work because their audience are very different from mine and their angles can't be compared to my product. 

I have a full trained chat on claude where i give her information, working scripts, non winning scripts, reference scripts from other brands etc but i just keep getting same kinds of results on the scripts and i can't seem to find other angles or just overall ideas.
[1.12.25, 20:30:57] ~ MG Business: Good luck man I believe in you. Getting outside of the box is good for the brain
[1.12.25, 20:32:41] ~ Oscar: Thanks man, but running this product for 2 years now and still stuck at 20k months, sometimes more sucks.

[2.12.25, 18:24:17] ~ David B: Really good turnout today. Thanks  to everyone who was able to attend.

[2.12.25, 18:47:48] ~ Oscar: Thank you man! Much value in one call 🙏
[2.12.25, 19:29:59] ~ Hunter Davenport: Yo does anyone have a good solution for handling returns when you don’t have a 3PL and are shipping from China?

I’ve been having customers send packages to a local ups and I’ll go over there to pick it up, inspect, and reship to new customers but it’s a pain in the ass and time consuming. Trying to automate this asap. Any ideas help
[2.12.25, 19:38:37] ~ Oscar: hey guys, i had a question about the call for store reviews. in the description it says 'Make sure to fill out the Store Review Checklist before joining or your store won’t be reviewed. (click on registration link for details)' 

where can i find that registration link to be sure that i'm prepared for the call. Thanks
[2.12.25, 19:39:31] ~ Oscar: I also got a few messages from customers that want to place an order by using paypal but they say it doesn't work. I have installed paypal on my shopify store and it also says that it's active in my shopify payment settings?
[2.12.25, 19:44:18] ~ Drew Cable: If you see PayPal on the site but it won’t accept the payment that’s normally a limitation on the PayPal account. I’d log into your PayPal and see if there are any flags. Then message support if you’re still having issues
[2.12.25, 19:44:53] ~ Oscar: Okay thank you, i think i found the issue because i saw this morning a message from paypal saying that my account is deactivated?
[2.12.25, 19:46:07] ~ Drew Cable: That will do it. I’d disable from your site until resolved. What country is the account located in?
[2.12.25, 19:46:31] ~ Oscar: it should be Belgium
[2.12.25, 19:47:36] ~ Drew Cable: I work with US/Canada but log into the account and you should be able to chat with support
[2.12.25, 19:53:53] ~ MG Business: Trying to find past calls from this month can somebody point me in right direction on Skool?
[2.12.25, 19:58:41] ~ Oscar: thanks man, i'll take a look
‎[2.12.25, 20:20:00] ~ Ryan Kamal: ‎image omitted
[2.12.25, 20:52:21] ~ Oscar: Can anyone explain to me the difference to me between a VSL and a generic video ad, or is it the same?
[2.12.25, 20:53:31] ~ David B: A VSL is usually longer and more detailed some can go on for 10-20 minutes. A VSL is more like the equivalent of an advertorial but in video format.
[2.12.25, 20:53:55] ~ Oscar: okay thanks man, now it's clear!!
[2.12.25, 20:54:01] ~ David B: Check out MiamiMD if you want to see some VSL examples and DM I think I have some saved somewhere.
[2.12.25, 20:54:40] ~ Oscar: Okay i will for sure, much value i still have to look within the classroom!
[2.12.25, 21:49:57] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, what do you do again when Claude is just giving you the same angles, structure in the copy's for video ads, advertorials etc?

i have a project with all sorts of documents in it of the market, audience etc. 

in the prompt i write:

Hey, write me a script for a generic video ad.
The style of the video ad is a voice over with b-rolls. 

Than i also give him the persona of the target group (age, gender, pain points)
write the first half so i can give feedback is also what i write in the prompt ‎<This message was edited>
[2.12.25, 21:53:03] ~ David B: What timezone are you in?
[2.12.25, 21:53:58] ~ Oscar: CET brother! currently 8.53pm for me.
[2.12.25, 21:54:48] ~ David B: Perfect. I've got time around 11am UK time tomorrow. If you want to get better at claude, we can hop on a quick 15-30 minute call. ‎<This message was edited>
[2.12.25, 21:56:22] ~ Oscar: brother i would appreciate that a lot and i'm happy to make time for that! 🙏
[2.12.25, 21:56:47] ~ David B: DM me your email and I'll send a link.
[2.12.25, 22:00:54] ~ David: also make sure to use Opus 4.5
A few weeks ago they promoted Sonnet 4.5 as the „smartest for everyday tasks“ and at least for me, it fucking sucks compared to the „old“ Sonnet 4.5.

they since have removed the „legacy“ label from Opus 4.5 and promote it as the most capable so looks like they noticed that too.
[2.12.25, 22:03:48] ~ Oscar: haven't heard about that but i see it on claude. So what you recommend specifically?
[2.12.25, 22:08:07] ~ David: for copywriting, ads etc. definitely Opus. Sonnet is worse than ChatGPT imo if both are trained right.
[2.12.25, 22:11:59] ~ MG Business: I’ve been thinking about cancelling my gpt plus and switching to the Google Gemini studio or something. Any thoughts? Want a lot of tools under one subscription preferably. Is Claude that much better than the competition for copywriting? Asking to learn
[2.12.25, 22:15:25] ~ Oscar: which opus than specifically, the OPUS 4.5?
[2.12.25, 22:15:26] ~ David: a bit more tricky but if used right, its the most human and creative one out there. you can really push the limits with this one and cook something wild with the right prompts. difficult to achieve with ChatGPT, always has that AI slang / limitation that people recognize immediately.

The one thing ChatGPT has going for them is better memory and cross-chat reference. Claude improved a lot in that segment lately but still, its tricky and sometimes it goes full retard mode because of that.

If you work a lot with AI and got time to really train it, its worth it. Got no reference regarding Grok, Gemini etc., only trained the shit out of ChatGPT and Claude and on a good day, claude beats ChatGPT while GPT still has some nieche use cases so I use both.

[2.12.25, 22:17:55] ~ David: Same prompt. Lower one is Claude
[2.12.25, 22:41:21] ~ Viktor: ‎Alex  Fedotoff added ~ Viktor
[2.12.25, 22:49:19] ~ Jacob: gemini got worse with the last update, maybe in the ai studio when you can control the temperature is better
[2.12.25, 22:49:25] ~ Jacob: in terms of copy
[2.12.25, 22:49:34] ~ Jacob: i didn't check it
[2.12.25, 22:49:45] ~ Jacob: i came back to claude in terms of copy
[2.12.25, 22:49:50] ~ Jacob: the sonnet 4.5 is good
[2.12.25, 22:50:17] ~ Jacob: i asked today to improve 2 hooks and 2 cta and it's did a good job
[2.12.25, 22:50:42] ~ MG Business: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 let me run through a brick wall
[2.12.25, 22:51:18] ~ MG Business: Okay I use chat all day every day might as well make the switch to Claude
[2.12.25, 22:51:43] ~ Jacob: and gpt with right insturctions , and like David says, when it's has a good memory of which kind of copy you like, and you reference a lot to famous copywriters m and tell it to write in their style, it's not so bad as well, but i think claude for now is winning
[2.12.25, 22:52:19] ~ MG Business: Would you say if I’m great at training chat gpt then I’d have no issue training Claude properly as well
[2.12.25, 22:52:30] ~ Jacob: i told it to write a story ad yesterday, and it's did it the best, divide it to part, to the right psychological journey that someone should go through, it's understands marketing psychology better
[2.12.25, 22:52:41] ~ MG Business: Based on those screenshots of same prompt different output, seems I’d get better results with Claude definitely
[2.12.25, 22:52:58] ~ Jacob: just open claude free version now
[2.12.25, 22:53:09] ~ Jacob: and also @⁨Matán Intsuper⁩  just recommend me open router ai
[2.12.25, 22:53:12] ~ Jacob: it's actually cool
[2.12.25, 22:53:19] ~ MG Business: I play around with the different models and see what does what
[2.12.25, 22:53:33] ~ Jacob: you can write one promt - and get answers from 4-5 models at the same time
[2.12.25, 22:53:36] ~ Jacob: and choose what better
‎[2.12.25, 22:54:31] ~ Jacob: ‎image omitted
[2.12.25, 22:54:48] ~ Jacob: it's credit based
[2.12.25, 22:55:43] ~ David: absolutely. feed it a ton of info on the first chats, AI cheat sheets if you have (we have a folder with condensed info about our brand, targeting group, brand language etc. that we can just feed AI if we get a new employee with a fresh chat) and make sure to really push it. need to tell it a few times to really start cooking. then you get these results. 

If you open a new chat you need to tell it „for context, analyze chat XY“ though, thats the incomplete memory. you need to specifically tell it to cross reference at the start of a new chat (if needed)
[2.12.25, 22:57:49] ~ MG Business: If anyone is interested in going deeper into Agentic AI where a system waits for triggers and then executes commands, I can help point you in the right direction. It’s really good for streamlining repetitive tasks. 

These systems use any ai model you want. Claude, open router, deepseek, you name it. So you can get very specific and do some very very cool things with it.
[2.12.25, 22:58:17] ~ MG Business: Yep yep that’s the way
[2.12.25, 22:58:24] ~ David: hard af man. we actually wanna attack that next year. will hit you up 🤙🏼
[2.12.25, 22:58:40] ~ MG Business: Does Claude slow down after you spend a lot of time in one chat
[2.12.25, 22:59:05] ~ Jacob: can you write some examples
[2.12.25, 22:59:14] ~ Jacob: i mean some use cases you use
[2.12.25, 22:59:15] ~ David: yes. restart fixes it sometimes but still a bit buggy
[2.12.25, 23:04:53] ~ MG Business: So my AI agency was for smaller businesses so everything in my service was meant for a smaller scale but it’s absolutely scalable, I just was not capable of handling those types of clients. 
 
There are a million ways to go about using agentic AI which is the best part about it. Some really great use cases at scale would be for organization / books purposes. If done properly it can keep track of all your orders and monthly overhead in a Google sheet and provide custom analyzed emails daily/weekly of your expenditures and where / what you need to improve. 

Another could be using it for customer service. There’s a ton of use cases for that. Obviously you could use a paid commercial service chat bot but I’m telling you all it’s not hard to get one built & trained custom to your brand and store ‎<This message was edited>
[2.12.25, 23:06:02] ~ MG Business: Both of those are loose examples hopefully you all get the general idea 😅. Let me know if I wasn’t too clear
[2.12.25, 23:10:41] ~ MG Business: Another quick example is Instant call / calendar booking based on lead form triggers. As I said it’s super super good for repetitive tasks that simply can be delegated to AI for efficiency

‎[3.12.25, 0:28:28] ~ Oscar: ‎image omitted
[3.12.25, 1:38:38] ~ JB: Do you guys use the Advantage + creative text generation ai for primary text or headlines?
[3.12.25, 1:40:41] ~ Oscar: i have it off, never really tried it though.
[3.12.25, 1:41:20] ~ Jacob: it depends...if it's a simple copy you can use the text generation, when i write more complicated copy it's usually not that good
[3.12.25, 1:41:38] ~ Jacob: if it's a simple promotions so i turn it on sometimes
[3.12.25, 1:42:00] ~ Jacob: but if it's avatar based story ad, something more specific, more nuanced, so usually it's not doing good job
[3.12.25, 5:46:01] ~ Austin: Hey guys who’s in Thailand? Who’s in South Africa? Deciding on which to head to next week. Lmk and we might connect.
[3.12.25, 7:58:53] ~ Calvin: Im in SA brother
[3.12.25, 8:13:27] China Bigboss: I'm in Thailand now brother
[3.12.25, 8:13:29] China Bigboss: Are you here

‎[3.12.25, 12:23:49] ~ Oscar: ‎image omitted
[3.12.25, 12:52:43] ~ Musawer: My recommendation is keep it, if in a few day still the other ads are  bad and fb not spending on ad 1, pause the others and just run the creative 1
[3.12.25, 12:53:57] ~ Oscar: okay, well i just had an other recommendation and i've already turned creative 3 off hahaha, but i've seen that fb was already spending way more money on creative 3 again so probably would just do it again which is not what we want.
[3.12.25, 12:54:20] ~ Oscar: Appreciate the help though, next time i'll let fb do it's thing.
[3.12.25, 12:56:14] ~ A A: Up the spend
[3.12.25, 12:56:46] ~ A A: High chance of these numbers going south once you crank up even $500/day
[3.12.25, 12:57:55] ~ A A: I know everyone has their own way of testing, but imo anything less than 10 sales per day is insignificant to draw conclusions
[3.12.25, 12:59:27] ~ Oscar: okay but i assume you're on a very high level than? I always set budget on $25 for new adsets, i've also been running ABO campaign for months, now trying CBO again because that hasn't worked for me for the past months.
‎[3.12.25, 13:11:34] ~ Jacob: ‎image omitted
[3.12.25, 13:32:27] ~ Dr. Amr hamed: Dont worry it will usually go through and you dont have to submit all those documents they are asking for any of those documents not all of it. And if you want to go above and beyond submit two or three of them ‎<This message was edited>
[3.12.25, 14:00:40] ~ Jacob: You think just the EIN will be enough or should i go above and beyond and upload inventory photos as well?
[3.12.25, 14:28:44] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, do you ever recommend scaling a specific adset that is performing insanely well (talking about and adset with 15+ ROAS today, yesterday 4.8 ROAS and the day before that 7+ ROAS) throughout the day? 

My ad account is usually not performing well if i try scaling things aggressive because the performs is good. I always scale slowly to keep everything stable and run well for long term. 
what do you think?
[3.12.25, 14:29:35] ~ Oscar: Or what metric should i look at first before deciding to scale something?
[3.12.25, 14:29:43] ~ Oscar: besides ROAS of course
[3.12.25, 14:30:44] ~ Khodor: With such ROAS I think it is very safe to scale by 20%
[3.12.25, 14:30:58] ~ Khodor: I do check cost per add to cart, and CI
[3.12.25, 14:31:12] ~ Khodor: Cpr too for sure
[3.12.25, 14:31:47] ~ Oscar: Okay what is Cl metric?
[3.12.25, 14:31:54] ~ Oscar: how do you analyse those metrics than?
[3.12.25, 14:32:05] ~ Khodor: Cost per checkout initiated ‎<This message was edited>
[3.12.25, 14:35:17] ~ Khodor: I usually check if the creative spent the AOV of the product

If no- I keep it on
If yes- I check if my ROAS is at the +50%profit margin or not 

If not, I turn it off 
If yes, I scale it by 20%
[3.12.25, 14:36:41] ~ Khodor: So just, calculate your breakeven ROAS, and at 50% how much it ROAS should be, and it will be easy to understand how profitable each ad is
[3.12.25, 14:37:07] ~ Oscar: my BEROAS is 1.4
[3.12.25, 14:37:20] ~ Khodor: Wow, amazing
[3.12.25, 14:38:03] ~ Khodor: In your case I would have scaled this ad 20-30% everyday the ROAS is above my 50% profit margin target ‎<This message was edited>
[3.12.25, 14:39:38] ~ Oscar: Okay but usually if i scale something it just drops down. what does work for me is duplicating that adset and setting it back to the 25 dollar and slowly scaling that adset.
[3.12.25, 14:40:03] ~ Khodor: It will drop, for sure, but how much will it drop?
[3.12.25, 14:40:12] ~ Oscar: i've done that 2 times succesfully and have sometimes performed better than original adsets
[3.12.25, 14:40:34] ~ Oscar: usually big, like it tanks down and becomes unprofitable after 2-3 days
[3.12.25, 14:43:02] ~ Khodor: Very unusual for me, you saying you have one ad set with ROAS average 7.0, with budget 25$ 
And when you scale it, the ROAS drops to 2?
[3.12.25, 14:43:19] ~ Khodor: How much you scale it per single time ?
‎[3.12.25, 14:43:20] ~ Oscar: ‎image omitted
[3.12.25, 14:44:46] ~ Oscar: yeah pretty much. My product doesn't work very well on scale. I have an ABO campaign for 3 months running and i don't scale to hard. One adset is at 200 dollars a day but i have built that in a period of a month or so, still isn't super stable sometimes.
[3.12.25, 14:44:57] ~ Oscar: 25 dollars, i've tried more (not good)
[3.12.25, 14:45:12] ~ Khodor: So it’s 25$ and you add 25 more?
[3.12.25, 14:46:15] ~ Oscar: in the picture that adset is at 50 dollars so i would go to 75 dollars.
[3.12.25, 14:47:38] ~ Khodor: It’s 37% increase, try to increase only 20% each time 
So if it’s 50$ scale by adding 10$ only
[3.12.25, 14:50:58] ~ Oscar: okay so 10 dollars now?
[3.12.25, 15:03:26] ~ Khodor: Yes bro
[3.12.25, 15:24:07] ~ Oscar: Okay thank you brother for the help!
[3.12.25, 15:24:26] ~ Khodor: Happy to help!

[3.12.25, 20:20:32] ~ Oscar: for the scaling systems and operations, how does this call typically looks like? Is it for questions or do we get to learn something also?
[3.12.25, 21:33:53] ~ Jas: Is the scaling systems call still going ahead it said starting at 7pm gmt on ESS but 7:30 gmt and it is still loading
[3.12.25, 21:35:04] ~ John B: That call is every other week. It was last week so none this week.

[4.12.25, 2:32:47] ~ Austin: Can someone please connect me to an agency or freelancer that can run Rumble / X ads?
[4.12.25, 2:33:53] ~ Oscar: hi guys, when lowering the budget on a specific adset, what percentage should that be? Is it the same as 20% for scaling?
[4.12.25, 2:34:07] ~ Austin: Yes i do 20-25%
[4.12.25, 2:34:18] ~ Austin: ABO or CBO
[4.12.25, 2:34:22] ~ Oscar: ABO
[4.12.25, 2:34:33] ~ Austin: i meant i do the same for either
[4.12.25, 2:34:37] ~ Austin: or advantage +
[4.12.25, 2:34:56] ~ Austin: everything i lower by 20-25% depending on how much i need lower
[4.12.25, 2:35:04] ~ Oscar: ah yeah my bad
[4.12.25, 2:35:10] ~ Austin: all good
[4.12.25, 2:35:17] ~ Oscar: got it!
[4.12.25, 2:35:34] ~ Oscar: thanks brother, by the way i cannot help you unfortunately
[4.12.25, 2:36:06] ~ Austin: all good
[4.12.25, 2:36:11] ~ Austin: weird request
[4.12.25, 2:37:03] ~ Oscar: when do you recommend lowering the budget on an adset? Like i assume not if you had one bad day after you've scaled the budget the day before?
[4.12.25, 2:37:37] ~ Austin: I do 3 full days + today
[4.12.25, 2:37:40] ~ Oscar: i tried scaling an adset yesterday for today and the performance has dropped but it's still good ROAS in the longer time frame
[4.12.25, 2:38:01] ~ Austin: i wouldn’t lower off of one day data
[4.12.25, 2:38:11] ~ Austin: especially if its low spend
[4.12.25, 2:38:12] ~ Oscar: yeah make sense
[4.12.25, 2:38:18] ~ MG Business: 3 full days for me as well
[4.12.25, 2:38:36] ~ Austin: if it doesnt get correct results after 3 days + today then I leave it for a bit
[4.12.25, 2:38:42] ~ Austin: unless its holidays
[4.12.25, 2:38:46] ~ Austin: and surf scaling
[4.12.25, 2:39:00] ~ Oscar: i started looking at time frame of last 7 days including the day i look at it.
[4.12.25, 2:39:10] ~ Oscar: been doing very well for me
[4.12.25, 2:39:13] ~ Austin: btw surfing has been a big unlock for me…double budget ever 3 hours…crazy scale on nearly any holiday / time specific promo
[4.12.25, 2:39:42] ~ Austin: still running bf promos as well and still crushing
[4.12.25, 2:39:45] ~ MG Business: need to get on that fb ads is where I need to improve most
[4.12.25, 2:39:58] ~ Oscar: okay, i don't think it's going to work for my ad account to be honest. I never been able to scale a lot.
[4.12.25, 2:40:15] ~ Austin: ok results are brand specific
[4.12.25, 2:40:18] ~ Oscar: especially so agressive.
[4.12.25, 2:40:32] ~ Oscar: yeah for sure!
[4.12.25, 2:40:35] ~ Austin: whats your monthly spend?
[4.12.25, 2:40:57] ~ Oscar: last month a little over 20k and made 83k
[4.12.25, 2:42:12] ~ MG Business: Nice
[4.12.25, 2:42:15] ~ MG Business: Good work
[4.12.25, 2:42:47] ~ Oscar: thanks but i want more 😂, was my biggest month tho so was very happy
[4.12.25, 2:43:19] ~ MG Business: Test more products
[4.12.25, 2:43:46] ~ Oscar: yeah for sure, haven't gotten the structure down on how to do that. Have to learn that ‎<This message was edited>
[4.12.25, 2:44:13] ~ MG Business: I can help. I’ve got product testing down to a science, can recommend some videos
[4.12.25, 8:03:00] ~ L: Interested as well 😎
[4.12.25, 8:29:15] ~ Lana: Looking for an operator to buy 60% of the brand.

Hi guys, I have a relationship/wellness brand that has done lifetime revenue over 1.3M€. Profitable from 2022 to 2024. 2025 hit with many challenges. Now looking for an operator to take over.

Main market: Germany & USA
Not ds. Own unique product.
Revenue 2024: 530K€ ($600K)

DM for more info.
[4.12.25, 9:56:19] ~ Ariel Gaona: If my cbo didnt spend full budget for the day but it performed well and has performed for the last 2 days should i scale by 30%?
[4.12.25, 9:56:57] ~ Ariel Gaona: it has been getting amazing performance but is under spending. It seems like backward logic to increase budget if its not even spending it to begin with
[4.12.25, 9:59:24] ~ Ariel Gaona: it has been performing well for the past 3 days but has underspent 2 of those 3 days by like 20%
‎[4.12.25, 10:00:45] ~ David: ‎image omitted
[4.12.25, 10:02:49] ~ Cocow: You can definitely spend more 

Global Roas of 4 is amazing , go get more volume , more creatives and break this limiting belief you have
[4.12.25, 10:03:23] ~ Cocow: If you 2 twice more volume with roas 3 for example you still end up with more money
[4.12.25, 10:21:46] ~ Oscar: Okay, I do lack content which is why i don’t get to make more creatives. 

What do you do when you lack content and it’s very hard to make it yourself because you need someone else to help you with the filming? Always been filming with my dad and he knows what to do but he never has time anymore. 

So I want to look for other people who might be able to do it.
[4.12.25, 10:26:24] ~ Cocow: What do you do if you lack of money ? You make it 😅

Just go on UGC , Facebook acting groups , Fiverr , backstage whatever 

Create a little playbook of your product and even a video on how to use 

Ship the product to creators 

Ask them to record ads , b rolls , and you have content
[4.12.25, 10:26:59] ~ Cocow: Other thing : take a creative agency for 2/3 months. It is an investment but they will do ads , get content for you that you can use without any problem
[4.12.25, 10:27:26] ~ L: Do you have anyone to recommend ?
[4.12.25, 10:28:21] ~ Oscar: Yeah you’re totally right, I have tried it before but they all sucked because they couldn’t work with the product very well. I did told them how it works etc.
[4.12.25, 10:28:25] ~ Cocow: I am in French market so cannot give you anyone but probably here some have :)
[4.12.25, 10:28:57] ~ Cocow: Even your dad can record the video and explain , with his own words that fit the audience
[4.12.25, 10:29:36] ~ Oscar: Does anyone have a good creative agency you can recommend for me?
[4.12.25, 10:29:55] ~ L: Dear god how do you work there😅
Everyone’s so skeptical
[4.12.25, 10:30:06] ~ Luka: To scale you need a content engine. You have strong ROAS, reinvest that into content creation, video editing etc. Since we’re in a specific market, we find good creators on IG (reels) or TikTok and give them the script shot-by-shot. Then the video editing team uses that to make UGC ads + uses the assets for general ads
[4.12.25, 10:30:40] ~ Luka: There are services like Influee and similar but we’ve never done those so someone else might be able to comment on that
[4.12.25, 10:30:43] ~ Oscar: Yeah for sure but unfortunately my dad isn’t open to talk to the camera (he hates it) and also never has time because of his business.
[4.12.25, 10:31:09] ~ Cocow: Skeptical if you use the US marketing , but this is still not easy sometimes in fact 😅
[4.12.25, 10:32:09] ~ Cocow: Then do the video by yourself , you should be the best one to explain your product
[4.12.25, 10:33:53] ~ David B: Reach out to your top customers, offer them a discount or free product if they create a video review for you. 
Consider running a sweepstake or competition where they can win $100 of amazon vouchers for the most creative place your product has been used or something like that. 
Find creators in your niche, reach out to them and offer them free products if they record some video for you. 
Get creative with "POV" / No face content that anyone can film and build your library that way.
Speak to friends and family and don't neglect upwork. There are affordable content creators on there as well as fiverrr, backstage etc.
[4.12.25, 10:49:56] ~ Oscar: Yeah you’re right, what I do now is give them the IG of our brand where they can see how they should use it. 

But I’ll make a video on it!
[4.12.25, 11:11:03] ~ Cocow: Check the errors people do and make a playbook to explain how to avoid them for example :)
[4.12.25, 11:26:41] ~ Oscar: Appreciate all the help brothers!
‎[4.12.25, 13:02:12] ~ L: ‎image omitted
[4.12.25, 13:02:52] ~ RS: Too high normally
[4.12.25, 13:04:07] ~ L: Thank god 😅
I thought I had to deal with it. 
any recommendation?
[4.12.25, 13:04:10] ~ RS: Anti aging niche in the US for me and cpms for the last 30 days are 120-140$ for most campaigns using image ads. With some video ads cpms range from 180-230$
[4.12.25, 13:04:31] ~ RS: Its one day or 30 days?
[4.12.25, 13:05:10] ~ L: last 2 weeks
[4.12.25, 13:05:31] ~ L: How’s you cpc - I’m averaging 5$ 😅
[4.12.25, 13:06:21] ~ RS: 2.5-4$ usually but Im running traffic to funnel. So even woth 4-5$ CPC I am profitable because of the AOV
[4.12.25, 13:16:40] ~ L: Good I understand.
I guess changing Page or Ad account won’t give lower costs, right? Ever tried testing that?
[4.12.25, 13:53:26] ~ Oscar: Hi guys, I’ve tried contacting PayPal several times because my account got deactivated and they just always say that this phone number isn’t available at this moment. 

It’s the correct phone number for my country so I don’t know why it’s not working?

Any ideas?
[4.12.25, 13:57:25] ~ Bestfulfill—william: U will need to find the account manager from your country
[4.12.25, 13:57:31] ~ Bestfulfill—william: From PayPal
[4.12.25, 13:57:38] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Then everything can be easier
[4.12.25, 13:58:04] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Customer support won’t help anything even the phone call get through
[4.12.25, 13:58:28] ~ Oscar: where can i find the account manager from my country brother?
[4.12.25, 13:58:44] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Figure it out yourself ‎<This message was edited>
[4.12.25, 13:59:05] ~ Oscar: okay you're right
[4.12.25, 13:59:34] ~ Allen David Shor: Usually once you start spending substantial amounts and all your ad accounts are in onw BM the account team will reach out to you
[4.12.25, 13:59:50] ~ Allen David Shor: Also YoY growth is very important
[4.12.25, 14:00:05] ~ RS: I think they talk about PayPal
‎[4.12.25, 14:00:11] ~ Lana: ‎image omitted
[4.12.25, 14:00:31] ~ Oscar: yeah it's about paypal 😂
[4.12.25, 14:02:50] ~ Alessandro: Hello guys. I have my Shopify payments account in review since 20 November, any solutions?
[4.12.25, 14:07:52] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Ban China ip maybe
[4.12.25, 14:46:41] ~ Lana: Didnt work
[4.12.25, 16:03:40] ~ Jacob: Hi guys, stripe just asked me 2 days ago for documents and froze activity that was there, and I need to provide documents. I have proofs of activity of shopify payments with refund rate lower than 1% in the last 6 months, which is good and helpful. 

my question is, how to show my business? I mean, my supplier can make me a proof that he sent the products to my business address, but it's not the reality. im doing dropship and sending directly to the customer from cj. what will you do? you will show tracking numbers and deliveries as they send to my business address (and invoices) or the truth, which is directly to clients? and make it look more like dropship
[4.12.25, 16:04:43] ~ Jacob: or it's not critical at all, as long as i have proofs from shopify payments for good activity , and other proofs they are asking for
[4.12.25, 16:23:27] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Tell them u order bulk inventory and sent them the inventory photos with dates and tell Shopify u use a 3pl to ship orders
[4.12.25, 16:43:15] ~ L: NEVER show them you’re dropshipping brother 
I’ve seen well aged Stripe account put on hold or closed due to that. Always show proof of you being extremely legit, kinda like a Corporate structured business
[4.12.25, 16:44:05] ~ L: Guys do SORA or VEO 3.1 ads get higher CPM in your experience?
[4.12.25, 16:44:51] ~ Rui Bessa: Not from my experience
[4.12.25, 16:51:42] ~ MG Business: Watch that vid I sent you Oscar
[4.12.25, 16:52:24] ~ Oscar: yeah i did yesterday, for image ads that's great!!
[4.12.25, 16:54:16] ~ MG Business: I’m trying to get into sora but can’t make it work
[4.12.25, 16:54:52] ~ Oscar: have you used nano bananan pro for making the image and than using that image to generate a video from it?
[4.12.25, 16:55:32] ~ MG Business: woahhhhh no but fk that sounds good
[4.12.25, 16:55:50] ~ MG Business: Do you need a script or just a proper prompt saying to animate it?
[4.12.25, 17:02:07] ~ Oscar: you can put the image in chatgpt and tell what you want and that he creates a prompt for sora 2 of that idea. they say that something with 'timeline prompting' works very well, that means every second get's explained with the time zones mentioned.

here is also an article about sora 2 prompt structure: https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/sora/sora2_prompting_guide

maybe feed this in the chat.
[4.12.25, 17:04:01] ~ MG Business: Yes I’ve seen the timeline prompting, thanks for the resource I’ll definitely look at it later and see what I can cook
[4.12.25, 17:04:26] ~ Oscar: no problem brother, hopefully it works well.
[4.12.25, 17:04:36] ~ Oscar: you use higgsfield for the generations?
[4.12.25, 17:05:47] ~ MG Business: Yes, I’ve got to the point where i can rip like 50 A+ statics at a time and knowing which models are good for what
[4.12.25, 17:06:05] ~ Oscar: nice!!
[4.12.25, 17:06:31] ~ MG Business: really want to start nailing animated images w/ sora and maybe AI ugc too but im super critical of my own work and i don’t know if i could make AI ugc look believable enough for me to run it myself🤣
[4.12.25, 17:13:50] ~ Oscar: yeah it's not easy, i've tried it also but he does not understand my product for some reaosn
[4.12.25, 17:15:34] ~ Khodor: guys AI images, nano banana pro, is very powerful, there is a tool named lovart 
It give syou opportunity to select any object of the generated image and tell ai to change it or replace it by what you need
[4.12.25, 17:20:47] ~ Oscar: Wow that sounds amazing!
[4.12.25, 17:21:10] ~ Oscar: isn't that also possible on higgsfield if you want to edit the generated image?
[4.12.25, 17:25:46] ~ MG Business: Higgsfield has everything in one spot
[4.12.25, 17:26:09] ~ Khodor: I have no idea (maybe it’s better
[4.12.25, 17:27:57] ~ MG Business: Would recommend higgsfield, it’s got all the latest models in one spot. Great for generating the same image with different models and seeing which you like best
[4.12.25, 17:29:59] ~ Khodor: Will give it a try, thanks man!!
‎[4.12.25, 18:04:23] ~ Oscar: ‎image omitted
[4.12.25, 18:05:06] ~ Oscar: Also 40 dollars because i've tried higher budgets before and never went well.
[4.12.25, 18:05:24] ~ Oscar: but yeah 4 x 10 dollars = 40 dollars (main reason why this budget)
[4.12.25, 18:30:04] ~ Facundo: Hey guys,

We just got notified that a Chinese company registered our brand in China. Do you have any similar experience? Does it affect us? If it does, do you have any lawyer with expertise in this field that you can recommend?

We have the brand registered in every country where we sell, but not in China. We have 4 days left to file an objection.
[4.12.25, 18:30:33] ~ Oscar: Hi guys, where do you recommend looking at for a VA?
[4.12.25, 18:44:06] ~ Jeremy Leppink: This is too conservative, if they were winning, launch the campaign higher. I would also not recommend doing a campaign on lower then $100
[4.12.25, 18:45:39] ~ Oscar: okay than i've misunderstood it. sorry about that!

create new CBO campaign for this? is the set up of each new concept new adset corrct? ‎<This message was edited>

[4.12.25, 18:46:33] ~ Oscar: or should i just have one adset with the video ads and image ad together?
[4.12.25, 19:09:06] ~ MG Business: Anyone else running native style static ads?
[4.12.25, 19:11:35] ~ Jeremy Leppink: Yes correct, you can set up a new campaign
[4.12.25, 19:11:41] ~ Jeremy Leppink: 1 concept per adset ‎<This message was edited>

[4.12.25, 22:04:41] Topi: With this roas youre printing money like a bank
[4.12.25, 22:09:05] ~ Oscar: What you suggest doing as set up?

I’ve tried CBO many times before and it does not work for me man 😭
[4.12.25, 22:43:16] ~ MG Business: Do your ad sets collapse and spend to only one ad in the set?
[4.12.25, 22:43:19] ~ MG Business: In a CBO
[4.12.25, 22:46:22] ~ Oscar: Yeah, but mostly just don’t spend at all.
[4.12.25, 23:45:07] ~ Farhat Godil: Have you guys noticed decrease in conv rate if paypal wallet is deactivated? Reason because those chargebacks are not caught by Disputifier and cannot risk my shopify payments - any pointers will be appreciated
[5.12.25, 1:30:28] ~ John B: Guys, we do around 5k a day in spend, one store, 3 main products, top product does 60% of the spend, then around 30% for second, 10% for third, all USA. I want to quickly test my best ads for these products in AU + CA. I was thinking about just making a CBO, 3 adsets, one for each product, all 3 with both AU and CA, and letting it run for a bit, see what does best and then double down on that product and country. Any advice for quickly testing international when you have numerous products like this?
[5.12.25, 2:29:13] ~ Oscar: Hi guys, where do you place the AD ID in the ads level? I've seen it when i've selected 'existing post' but than it says that they couldn't find the post when i put the Ad Id in? ‎<This message was edited>
[5.12.25, 2:44:39] ~ Oscar: i got it!
[5.12.25, 10:26:38] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey friends ! 

Does anyone has a contact/insider in wise bank ?
Itll help alot ‎<This message was edited>
[5.12.25, 10:38:34] ~ David: Guys for retargeting Ads, for example if you offer a bonus to get people to check out with stuff they already put in their cart but didn’t check out, a complete new ad set / campaign and exclude past buyers? Or just throw it in the mix with „retargeting wording“ and let andromeda do its thing?
[5.12.25, 10:41:24] ~ L: Guys have you noticed your offer impacting your facebooks costs ? 

I mean in your experience can 1 funnel have different CPM compare to another just because the offer is different ? (Same niche)
[5.12.25, 10:55:09] ~ Kim Romanov: Hey, guys! Shopify went down - 500 Internal Server Error
[5.12.25, 10:55:22] ~ Kim Romanov: Do anybody faces the same issue?
[5.12.25, 10:55:46] ~ Ariel Gaona: Wow
[5.12.25, 10:55:46] ~ Ariel Gaona: Facing the same thing
[5.12.25, 10:55:53] ~ Ariel Gaona: Should I shut off ads
[5.12.25, 10:55:56] ~ Ariel Gaona: Day just started
[5.12.25, 10:56:12] ~ Ariel Gaona: Don’t wanna waste 10k budget on nothing
[5.12.25, 10:56:32] ~ Ariel Gaona: Thoughts ?
[5.12.25, 10:57:19] ~ Idan Gabbay: Not only shopify, seems like another cloudflare issue
[5.12.25, 10:57:59] ~ Ariel Gaona: So???
[5.12.25, 10:58:04] ~ Ariel Gaona: What should we do lol
[5.12.25, 10:58:05] ~ Y: Cloudflare is down, it took down the internet with it again it seems, Funnelish dashboard is down too, sorry about that.
[5.12.25, 10:58:15] ~ Ariel Gaona: This has never happened to me before
[5.12.25, 10:58:36] ~ Idan Gabbay: Stop sending traffic i guess my brother
[5.12.25, 10:58:46] ~ Idan Gabbay: No shopify today
[5.12.25, 10:58:54] ~ Ariel Gaona: Fair enough

[5.12.25, 10:59:18] ~ Idan Gabbay: https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/

Can track it here tho
[5.12.25, 10:59:29] ~ B.A.: Shopify down?
[5.12.25, 10:59:30] ~ Idan Gabbay: Once it resolved shopify suppose to be set again
[5.12.25, 10:59:46] ~ RS: My funnel landers in funnelish is working even though I have cloudflare set up in funnelish
[5.12.25, 10:59:49] ~ B.A.: What do u guys do with ads?
[5.12.25, 10:59:55] ~ …: Cloudfare is down again. It might make sense to turn off ads if it takes a while for it to get fixed? @⁨~Jamie Melia⁩
[5.12.25, 11:00:08] ~ Colby: Maybe just lower budget
[5.12.25, 11:00:33] ~ Ariel Gaona: Lmk if yall are turning off ads
[5.12.25, 11:00:45] ~ Ariel Gaona: Seems pretty stupid to spend money and send traffic to a non working website
[5.12.25, 11:01:33] ~ B.A.: Lower budget and mess up all my momentum🥲
[5.12.25, 11:01:41] ~ Ariel Gaona: Ikr
[5.12.25, 11:01:45] ~ Colby: Momentum is important so maybe just lower budget instead of killing all your ads
[5.12.25, 11:01:55] ~ Y: still would recommend pausing ads, funnelish pages do not use cloudflare, but still payment processing might be affected (Stripe, PayPal…et all use Cloudflare)
[5.12.25, 11:01:57] ~ Mathias Bo: how much do you guys lower?
[5.12.25, 11:02:10] ~ Ariel Gaona: Good question

[5.12.25, 11:10:51] ~ Mathias Bo: I am thinking about lowering it 50%

[5.12.25, 13:56:24] ~ David: For Meta: Isn’t it possible to use UGC directly from fans that tagged us and promote it? If I remember correctly, there was an option to send an approval request to the fan/influencer but I can’t find it.
[5.12.25, 13:57:24] ~ Jacob: You mean partnership ads?
[5.12.25, 13:58:08] ~ Jacob: U can do it with partnership ads
[5.12.25, 13:58:43] ~ Jacob: But usually they need to give u ad id or u need to upload it manually
[5.12.25, 13:59:06] ~ Jacob: You can send them partnership request it on top of every ad
[5.12.25, 13:59:11] ~ Jacob: When u edit
[5.12.25, 14:00:16] ~ Jacob: - activate partnership ads , than add new partnership, search for them, and send them request, and wait for approval
[5.12.25, 14:00:40] ~ Jacob: Youll also get a link yoy can send them so they approve faster

[5.12.25, 20:18:14] ~ Oscar: just first day running this CBO campaign from 6am US
[5.12.25, 20:22:55] ~ MG Business: I wouldn’t even touch it for at least 2 days if you just started it
[5.12.25, 20:23:34] ~ Oscar: okay i'll let it do it's thing. hopefully this will perform man hahaha
[5.12.25, 20:23:38] ~ MG Business: Let it learn and spend in a new kind of campaign structure
[5.12.25, 20:24:19] ~ MG Business: If you set it up right and you’ve got a good funnel then put it in Gods hands 😅🙏🏽
[5.12.25, 20:46:18] ~ Oscar: yeah i've done the set up from the video you said i need to watch in the classroom!
[5.12.25, 20:46:50] ~ Oscar: is the call live for ecom mastery with Richie?
[5.12.25, 23:49:24] ~ Oscar: hi guys, for this CBO campaign, if i have another winning ad in my ABO campaign, can i also put that winning ad in the CBO campaign?
So feed the CBO campaign or just currently keep it running for at least 3 days to see some results coming in?
[5.12.25, 23:52:43] ~ MG Business: R u guys having issue with cloudflare still
[6.12.25, 3:13:06] ~ 🥇: Hi guys , any idea where I can find a US signer for my LLC?
[6.12.25, 8:06:26] ~ MG Business: Wym like a notary or someone to actually be the authorized member
[6.12.25, 14:18:42] ~ Kim Romanov: Guys, quick question for those running Shopify Plus stores.
Are you all paying the standard 0.4% platform fee on every order, or has anyone managed to negotiate with Shopify so they reduce or remove that fee (instead of paying both the 0.4% and the fixed $2.3–2.5k per month under the 1- or 3-year contract)? ‎<This message was edited>
[6.12.25, 15:18:40] ~ Marc F: any brands pushing native ads really hard that you would recommend us to check?
[6.12.25, 15:18:40] ~ Marc F: any niche
‎[6.12.25, 15:27:34] ~ Oscar: ‎image omitted
[6.12.25, 16:01:05] ~ MG Business: That cloud flare outage could’ve really messed w learning yesterday too
[6.12.25, 16:47:58] ~ Oscar: ah yeah maybe it did. thanks
[6.12.25, 16:56:50] ~ Oscar: hi guys, you recommend me going for an influencer for 1k a month? 

I have an influencer ready for making content for us, 1k for one month. he can make 6-10 video ads for us + raw clips. 
You think i should go ahead and work with that person (we have started already kinda)

Let me know brothers!
[6.12.25, 16:58:28] ~ Luka: Is the goal for the influencer to post, or to get assets?
If for your own assets, imo better to work with 2-3 so your assets is diversified in terms of who the person is, filming location, style etc ‎<This message was edited>
[6.12.25, 17:00:44] ~ Khodor: It’s ideal to get both of that(influencer, and your own assets), but if to choose one, I think influencer is more money printing if it’s the right influencer
[6.12.25, 17:01:28] ~ Oscar: Assets for now that we use for ads.
[6.12.25, 17:01:48] ~ Oscar: I had another person but he couldn’t deliver much.
[6.12.25, 17:02:22] ~ Oscar: Yeah gotcha, well he is influencer from our niche. He knows how to use the product.
[6.12.25, 17:20:49] ~ Mathias Bo: Hi guys, what does your current campaign structure look like for testing and scaling? ‎<This message was edited>
[6.12.25, 17:30:55] ~ MG Business: I do an ABO with 3 ad sets, 3 ads in each set so 9 total ads for testing. Each ad set is 1 angle
[6.12.25, 17:31:31] ~ MG Business: Then i push them to CBO for scaling but only after like 30-50 purchases on the ad
[6.12.25, 17:33:14] ~ L: Guys we just launched a new Funnel testing 9 Angles in a CBO 

A total of 75 ads 

100$ starting budget

It’s the first time I test so many ads when first starting (all image ads -> nanobanana make it soo fast that we couldn’t stop making ads😅)

are too many ads making the job too hard for facebook on a new pixel + new ad acc?
[6.12.25, 17:34:30] ~ MG Business: 75 ads in one CBO with only 100$ is way too many
[6.12.25, 17:34:42] ~ MG Business: I mean let a pro correct me if im wrong on that
[6.12.25, 17:34:58] ~ Jacob: its to much for $100
[6.12.25, 17:35:18] ~ Jacob: we usually test 3 ads on 50$ and 1 adset
[6.12.25, 17:35:20] ~ MG Business: 100$ for a broad campaign budget to spend between 75 ads is too small of a budget yes
[6.12.25, 17:35:23] ~ Jacob: so 75 ads for $100 its crazy
[6.12.25, 17:35:44] ~ L: 😂😂
[6.12.25, 17:35:47] ~ Jacob: its not effective and you will lost a lot of winners
[6.12.25, 17:35:52] ~ Jacob: will lose*
[6.12.25, 17:35:55] ~ MG Business: Some shit i would do though😹 i like nano banana
[6.12.25, 17:36:05] ~ Jacob: the cbo its not that effective of working with so much ads
[6.12.25, 17:36:29] ~ Jacob: we had advantage + scale campaign with like 20 ads and it alocate budget very bad in some point
[6.12.25, 17:36:34] ~ MG Business: @⁨~Jacob⁩ how did your ads do yesterday with the cloudflare issue
[6.12.25, 17:36:37] ~ L: What’s the ratio we should keep in mind 100$ for every x ads?
Or 10 ads for every X dollars?

Is there any relations with cpms?
[6.12.25, 17:37:03] ~ MG Business: $100 is testing money i test 9 ads for $100
[6.12.25, 17:37:22] ~ Jacob: yeah max
[6.12.25, 17:37:25] ~ MG Business: I used to test broad CBO at $100 but i got smart and switched to $30 ABO sets with 3 ads in each ad set
[6.12.25, 17:37:26] ~ Jacob: something like that
[6.12.25, 17:37:50] ~ Jacob: i tried few times cbo for testing and didn't like it so much
[6.12.25, 17:37:53] ~ Jacob: didnt work well
[6.12.25, 17:38:00] ~ MG Business: Feel like CBO got nerfed lol
[6.12.25, 17:38:01] ~ L: yeah we’re just testing actually - that’s why the budget is so low
[6.12.25, 17:38:21] ~ MG Business: you wanna be patient with testing and not blow all your ads at once like that and let the numbers come after like 2 full days
[6.12.25, 17:38:23] ~ Jacob: take into consideration that those 75 ads for meta are not 75 ads
[6.12.25, 17:38:40] ~ Jacob: with the new andromeda and gem update, if you only change smalls stuff they will consider it much less
[6.12.25, 17:39:11] ~ MG Business: For example guys i have a confession lol i used lovable store builder its super good but your pixel doesnt connect to it automatically and i lost a tonnnnnn of data like 12 days straight didnt realize and meta still somewhat optimized and pushed cold traffic and orders to those ads and my website
[6.12.25, 17:39:18] ~ L: They’re all very different from each other, very very different 

The structure is like this : 
1 CBO 
9 ADSET (1 p. angle) 
More than 1 Concept per adset
[6.12.25, 17:39:37] ~ Jacob: i will start with 3
[6.12.25, 17:39:40] ~ Jacob: adset
[6.12.25, 17:39:40] ~ Jacob: max
[6.12.25, 17:39:48] ~ MG Business: I think if i had 75 ads in a CBO I would’ve been completely screwed😹
[6.12.25, 17:39:49] ~ L: in an ABO campaign, right?
[6.12.25, 17:40:07] ~ Jacob: you can check both if you want and divide it by 2
[6.12.25, 17:40:11] ~ Jacob: 50$ cbo and 50$ abo
[6.12.25, 17:40:15] ~ Jacob: and check whats work better
[6.12.25, 17:40:24] ~ L: Fuck Meta damn I forgot how hard it was to get started with a brand new funnel dear lord
[6.12.25, 17:40:47] ~ Jacob: yeah its take time
[6.12.25, 17:41:08] ~ MG Business: I do 3 sets in an ABO. Each set is 1 angle. AND each ad in each set for angle has to be VERY VISUALLY DIFFERENT from each other. To give meta a ton of different data to test with. If the ads are too similar meta will collapse spend to only one of the similar looking ads
[6.12.25, 17:41:40] ~ MG Business: Someone tell me if im spitting BS and correct me 😹
[6.12.25, 17:41:57] ~ Jacob: its fine startegy
[6.12.25, 17:43:31] ~ Jacob: didnt see a big difference
[6.12.25, 17:44:33] ~ MG Business: Interesting
[6.12.25, 17:45:37] ~ Idan Gabbay: It resolved pretty quick tho ‎<This message was edited>
[6.12.25, 17:46:41] ~ MG Business: Yes I heard, I scheduled a campaign to begin right as the issue started, hours after it was resolved I did get a cloudflare error on Google briefly
[6.12.25, 18:23:21] ~ Marc F: whats up everyone. if we have a campaign running, and 2 out of 4 countires are not performing, but the campaign overall is doing good, can we just remove those 2 coutnries, or that will affect performance of the campaign?
[6.12.25, 18:41:01] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey friends 

If i wanna setup us llc as a backup entity (in addition to uk ltd) with shopify payments and everything - do i need a new shopify us account or something like that ?
Anyone operates with llc and can suggest what it needs ?
[6.12.25, 19:33:03] ~ Kim Romanov: Another store
[6.12.25, 19:33:37] ~ Kim Romanov: There’s no backup setup within one store for Shopify Payments
[6.12.25, 23:22:00] ~ Furkan: Hey guys 
I have a question about TikTok Shop US setup.

We have a US LLC (EIN + US address + ITIN) and a Shopify store selling to the US, but we’re stuck on TikTok Shop US verification – especially the part where they require a US-based primary representative (ID + residential address).

Has anyone here:
	1.	Successfully verified a TikTok Shop US while the real owners are based outside the US?
	2.	Worked with a paid US representative / agency that can help with this (legally) and is reliable?

Any recommendations, contacts or “don’t do this” advice would be super appreciated
[6.12.25, 23:48:30] ~ Oscar: Hi guys, i was looking at the module about retargeting. Jake (Jacobo) tells that you can run the retargeting ads inside an ABO and if you have one already than you can put it inside of that one.

I have an ABO campaign, he says to spend 5% of your overall ad account spend. I'm sitting at 1k day average so that's 50 dollars, but because im using my current ABO campaign does that mean that i need to run my 3 adsets on 16 dollar budget each? 3x16 is around 50 dollars. 

Or should i just do 25 dollars like i always do?
[6.12.25, 23:51:51] ~ Oscar: also, is it okay to use emojis in your primary text because i've heard that's not good?
[6.12.25, 23:57:35] ~ Adam Ashe: Wasssup my guys. Just scaled to 700k per month just inside UK sales. BBA only 14 months ago. Had some mofuckas run some cheap fake brand from China copying our product over the last 6 months, coulda been you motherfuckas 😂 let’s build for the long term it pays off. Peace out
[6.12.25, 23:58:12] ~ Oscar: Congrats brother!
[7.12.25, 0:12:22] ~ Tupac: Whats ur brand name bro maybe it was me
[7.12.25, 0:12:25] ~ Tupac: 😜
[7.12.25, 1:05:48] ~ Kim Romanov: To comply with TikTok's verification rules, you'll need a US-based representative with a Social Security number. I've tried using services from Fiverr to set up a US-based TikTok Shop, but they were suspended within 2-3 days. Here are your options:
1. Ask a real person you know in the US with a Social Security number to act as your representative.
2. Open a Global TikTok Shop through a Hong Kong company (you'll need to own a HK company for this).
[7.12.25, 1:07:05] ~ Furkan: Thank you brother
[7.12.25, 1:16:58] ~ Jacob: Why not llc
[7.12.25, 1:47:17] ~ Kim Romanov: You need a real person in the US representing your LLC
[7.12.25, 1:53:20] ~ Drew Cable: https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-is-a-beneficial-owner-and-why-do-i-need-to-provide-this-information-help498
[7.12.25, 1:54:18] ~ Drew Cable: At least a Beneficial Owner in the US is best practice for any processing
[7.12.25, 2:32:34] ~ Idan Gabbay: Thanks bro
[7.12.25, 2:43:22] ~ danny: for people in supplements , have u noticed a difference in what customers think based on sourcing supplement from china and shipping from their to sourcing in u.s and shipping to u.s? kinda thinking it depends on audience ur selling to but thought id still ask
[7.12.25, 8:56:17] ~ Giovanni: Just do the same budget and if they work you can raise the budget by 25% every 1/2 days. 

I launched 3 adsets in July at 20€ budget and I was spending less than 1k/day. When I started scaling they started to be more profitable and I easily raised their budget from 20€ to 1000€/day in a month even if I went over the 5% Jacobo said. At some point I was spending 25/30% of my daily budget on retargeting.
They’re still profitable and still spending 1k/day which now is 40% of my budget since I had to scale down a lot this week.

I think it really depends on you audience, my audience is mostly solution aware, that’s probably why I can spend more on retargeting
[7.12.25, 11:03:55] ~ Lana: I have. I can DM yot
[7.12.25, 13:50:21] ~ L: Guys have you noticed Ads straight out of Higgsfield or veo having high CPM maybe because AI?
[7.12.25, 13:53:02] ~ Giovanni: Guys, Amex limited my spend at 17k ( I don’t know why) , what other credit card you would recommend ? I would like something with either cashback or membership points.

I have a company in HK but I’m living in Italy right now and my Amex is a personal Italian platinum. I’m going to call them tomorrow but I don’t think I can remove the limit at the moment
[7.12.25, 14:51:07] ~ Santi Roa: Not sure if Slash will work without a US LLC
[7.12.25, 14:51:49] ~ Santi Roa: I can ask my account manager
[7.12.25, 15:43:15] ~ P: You can, for global usd product
[7.12.25, 15:50:43] ~ Oscar: okay got it, thank you!
[7.12.25, 16:58:03] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, if you want to run a new product and want to find a new marketing angle to target other people in the niche, what is the process of finding that? I assume with chatgpt but what would you ask him?
[7.12.25, 17:42:57] ~ Oscar: Jo guys, do ya'll use pagepilot when trying to test new products?
[7.12.25, 18:31:56] ~ MG Business: I just run more ads to find angles
[7.12.25, 18:33:19] ~ MG Business: In reality the only way you’re gonna find really good angles is by knowing your audience and establishing some sort of creative process for yourself
[7.12.25, 18:33:25] ~ Kim Romanov: Guys, quick question for those running Shopify Plus stores.
Are you all paying the standard 0.4% platform fee on every order, or has anyone managed to negotiate with Shopify so they reduce or remove that fee (instead of paying both the 0.4% and the fixed $2.3–2.5k per month under the 1- or 3-year contract)?
[7.12.25, 18:35:00] ~ MG Business: ALL AI is intelligence generated from a pre existing idea or multiple ideas mixed into one. So any angle idea you ever ever ever get from chat GPT or Claude has already been formulated and created elsewhere. AI cannot have original ideas @⁨~Oscar⁩. So sure you can text chat for guidance but id really try to create a creative process that works for you
[7.12.25, 21:59:31] ~ Oscar: yeah you're right, i'll figure it out by testing stuff!
[7.12.25, 21:59:37] ~ Oscar: thanks brother
[8.12.25, 11:41:47] ~ 🥇: Does anyone know someone who can assist me with opening chase bank ?
[8.12.25, 13:34:55] ~ Kim Romanov: What’s wrong with opening account at any branch? Or you need JP Morgan?
[8.12.25, 14:24:43] ~ David: Whats up kings, do you include lookalike audiences in your audiences or just keep it brought and let andromeda do its thing?
[8.12.25, 16:56:54] ~ MG Business: I typically don’t do lookalike audiences but I’ve heard of success with it
[8.12.25, 16:58:19] ~ L: Guys I have 5x the CPM my friend is having in the same Niche (same country)
What do you think might be the problem? Page? Ad account?
[8.12.25, 16:59:04] ~ MG Business: I wish I had the answer
[8.12.25, 17:00:22] ‪+49 174 9333617‬: ‎Victor added ‪+49 174 9333617‬
[8.12.25, 17:00:30] ~ Luka: We do purely broad. We’ve tried some lookalikes and at least for us, we find it’s usually a miss. And if there’s a winner, it’s only a winner for a short amount of time.

But imo worth giving it a go - if something doesn’t work for one business, doesn’t mean it won’t work for you
[8.12.25, 17:01:13] ~ Luka: You can test a CBO for the top % lookalikes and let Meta test it out. Doesn’t have to be high-budget
[8.12.25, 17:01:45] ~ MG Business: I’d rather let metas algorithm target people I mean I could be thinking of something in my head and meta shows me an ad for it lol
[8.12.25, 17:11:42] ~ L: Guys if any of you have any thoughts on this it would be really appreciated. I can pay for the info, I just want to not loose time on useless tests, and go straight to what’s relevant
[8.12.25, 17:24:50] ~ David: Well he obviously does something different. Have you compared ad / audience settings? Tracking? We for example use maximum tracking and also feed tracking from klaviyo back to meta (its more accurate for checkout engagements for example).

Also take a look at your website. If your website sucks, is slow etc., customer has a bad experience, meta counts this as bad performance, costs rise
[8.12.25, 20:44:57] ~ Reece Mander: Anyone have a good 3PL they use inside Europe?

[9.12.25, 8:11:36] ~ Erik: Arcads
[9.12.25, 9:13:33] ~ Giovanni: Guys what makes the difference between a scalable or non scalable ad? 

Recently I have many videos that are working in the testing phase (ROAS 3+) but then they don’t get spend in the CBO and even if I force them to spend they’re not profitable.

Of course this is something that always happens, but recently he’s happening too many times so I’m wondering if I can change something to try to scale them
[9.12.25, 11:20:05] ~ Alejandro H.: Hey guys! Any contact that can unban facebook rejected ads?
[9.12.25, 15:18:31] ~ Bestfulfill—william: Bro u can check with my team
[9.12.25, 19:17:39] ~ John B: Guys my ad account has been underspending by a ton the past few days. Sat it spent 7k, I only increased budgets from there, Sunday it dropped to 3k, and today it’s on track to do even less (without changing budgets) has this happened to anyone recently?
[9.12.25, 19:37:49] ~ Farhat Godil: same with me since last 2 days - on sunday it spent the whole budget by 8 am - but since last 2 days it has been underspending for some reason
[9.12.25, 19:39:16] ~ John B: How much underspending? It’s been super weird lately. Yesterday it underspent by like 70% but the ROAS was 6 on the whole account. Today it’s underspending same amount and the ROAS is normal like 2-2.5
[9.12.25, 19:41:00] ~ H: Guys when I run IG ads on my video, when I try to duplicate I can’t publish it.

if I try and it works, all the engagement disappear I can’t put all engagement in one video (existing post id) , 

How can I duplicate/scale IG ads with keeping existing post ID?

Thanks very much.
[9.12.25, 22:13:29] ~ Jacob: guys i wanna build a landing page inside my theme (without page builder), what's the best way to do that and how much it should cost (replicate my funnelish funnel to shopify native) , what are your recomendationes
[9.12.25, 22:14:35] ~ MG Business: Lovable is really good for new stores but you can’t connect an existing store and edit it
[9.12.25, 22:14:39] ~ MG Business: Atlas is a bit limited
[9.12.25, 22:14:50] ~ Jacob: my store is not new
[9.12.25, 22:14:53] ~ Jacob: it's just the funnel
[9.12.25, 22:15:11] ~ Jacob: like 3 pages

For example, if I have a gold card that’s reached this 150k cap for this year, if I open another on the same account with this one receive a new cap, or is it across the account as a whole.
[9.12.25, 23:48:45] Yaniv: Each card has this cap. Yes you could open a few. It does get reset by end of physical year.
[9.12.25, 23:50:32] ~ John B: Physical year as in the rolling date of when the card was opened or the regular calendar year for everyone ?
[10.12.25, 12:30:45] Topi: Hi team, unfortunately VSL call canceled today due to travels

Dm me if any questions
[10.12.25, 20:16:23] ~ JB: what do guys use to build out quick websites/product pages that already have a good structure?
[10.12.25, 20:16:38] ~ MG Business: Atlas / lovable
[10.12.25, 20:16:59] ~ MG Business: Or weblow AI if you don’t need Shopify integration
[10.12.25, 20:17:04] ~ MG Business: Lovable is only good for a new store
[10.12.25, 20:22:37] ~ Santi Roa: Hey everyone! 🔥 The scaling systems, ops, and culture call starts in 8 min!

[10.12.25, 20:24:54] ~ JULIUS: What's the best service / plug for opening LLC & keeping clean accounting as foreigner there?
[10.12.25, 20:30:42] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, hope you all doing well? 

Can anyone recommend me someone for building advertorials? 
Thanks
[10.12.25, 21:13:51] ~ Santiago: doola
[10.12.25, 22:48:49] ~ L: Guys we have 2 Ad account which are not spending. Do you have any solution to that cause we’re just wasting a lot of time here following what the support recommends
[10.12.25, 22:49:28] ~ MG Business: I’ve never personally had that happen so I don’t know how to help. Meta is ridiculous sometimes
[10.12.25, 22:49:58] ~ Oscar: what's the current budget right now?
[10.12.25, 22:50:13] ~ Oscar: are they recent the ad accounts?
[10.12.25, 22:50:48] ~ L: Yes new.
We just bumped it up to 1100€ p.day to see if we can get them un-stuck
[10.12.25, 22:50:54] ~ L: but nothing works
[10.12.25, 22:51:31] ~ Oscar: i've had this issue also and that was because the budget was set too high.
[10.12.25, 22:51:54] ~ Oscar: i start very very low budget because every ad account has a maximum budget and in the beginning it's very low.
[10.12.25, 22:52:05] ~ Oscar: once i switched the budget to very low it started spending.
[10.12.25, 22:52:12] ~ L: really
[10.12.25, 22:52:13] ~ Oscar: and than after that you can switch it back
[10.12.25, 22:52:52] ~ L: My bm is very strong and aged we have around 1500€ of spending limit as soon as we create the ad account
[10.12.25, 22:52:56] ~ L: but let’s try
[10.12.25, 22:52:56] ~ Oscar: I had this before, i set up a CBO campaign 100$ didn't spend and i had to lower it down to 20 dollars i think or even lower before it started spending. 

Those were also new ad accounts.
[10.12.25, 22:53:19] ~ Oscar: yeah, well it's really what i've seen working for me.
[10.12.25, 22:53:29] ~ Oscar: Hope it works also for you...
[10.12.25, 22:54:17] ~ L: I’ll try let’s see
[10.12.25, 22:54:22] ~ L: The support is useless ofc
‎[10.12.25, 22:54:27] ~ Oscar: ‎image omitted
[10.12.25, 22:54:57] ~ Oscar: yeah it is.
[10.12.25, 22:55:22] ~ Oscar: i would just try lower budget. Every ad account has a limit as you know and it might be that you're above that which means it won't spend money.
[11.12.25, 3:06:04] ~ Ryan Kamal: Hey guys, thought I’d share this here so you can take some value from it.

We took a store from $0 to $800,000/month on Google in just six months.

But the revenue isn't even the craziest part, it’s the owner. He just turned 19…

Bro was literally in high school making more than his entire faculty combined 💀

[11.12.25, 12:59:50] ~ Yusuf: Hey, we're testing checkout champ instead of shopify and our Conversion Rate is half of what it was

We noticed that more than 50% of people were using Shop Pay for payment method, can this be the reason?

Is there anyone experienced same, how did you deal with the conversion rate drop?

[11.12.25, 17:52:07] ~ Oscar: there's a link to those templates
[11.12.25, 17:52:14] ~ Oscar: i think the issues is my subscription but not sure
[11.12.25, 18:29:01] ~ Giovanni: I think they’re outdated and the platform doesn’t recognise them anymore , I’ve had the same issue, it’s not related to your subscription plan

[12.12.25, 0:45:12] ~ John B: Any tips for getting trust pilot reviews?
[12.12.25, 1:10:27] ~ Kevin Krieg: Easiest way is ask for website reviews (i.e. loox/judgeme) and then set up automation if they left 5 stars, to also ask them to leave the review on trustpilot. 20usd gift card or whatever

Obviously if you are really confident in your service you can ask for tp review right away without the protection step inbetween
[12.12.25, 1:11:29] ~ Kevin Krieg: There are also services that do them ofc
[12.12.25, 2:10:42] ~ Dryden Byrd: is changing your cart drawer a change that brings ads back to learning phase?
[12.12.25, 2:11:00] ~ MG Business: Never had issues
[12.12.25, 2:11:18] ~ MG Business: Would obviously effect how much more or less add to carts you get though
[12.12.25, 2:11:43] ~ Dryden Byrd: by changing something in the cart?
[12.12.25, 2:11:44] ~ Dryden Byrd: like the slider?
[12.12.25, 2:11:52] ~ Dryden Byrd: will affect atc rate?
[12.12.25, 2:12:49] ~ MG Business: I changed my cart drawer to slide out and saw it only helped
[12.12.25, 2:13:08] ~ MG Business: I didn’t see my ads go back to learning
[12.12.25, 2:13:41] ~ Dryden Byrd: mine slides out. I'm wondering if I change something within the actual cart drawer it changes anything
[12.12.25, 2:13:47] ~ Dryden Byrd: but im guessing not if you've done that
[12.12.25, 2:13:57] ~ Dryden Byrd: like for example if I added shipping protection
[12.12.25, 7:35:02] ~ Nicolas: Does anyone know how to add preselected shipping protection back in?
[12.12.25, 7:36:00] ~ Ariel Gaona: Custom coded or shrine pro
[12.12.25, 7:36:18] ~ Ariel Gaona: Hire on fiver or upwork should cost like 50-100
[12.12.25, 7:36:40] ~ Nicolas: + use Upcart or is not needed?
[12.12.25, 7:37:31] ~ Ariel Gaona: Not needed tbh
[12.12.25, 7:37:40] ~ Ariel Gaona: I custom coded before with it and without it
[12.12.25, 7:37:47] ~ Nicolas: appreciate it
[12.12.25, 14:02:48] ~ Rui Bessa: Hey Guys, anyone here running applovin traffic? Do long-form advertorials still perform for this type of traffic?
[12.12.25, 14:05:22] Matán Intsuper: have you been approved there?
[12.12.25, 14:05:54] ~ Rui Bessa: yup
[12.12.25, 14:06:36] Matán Intsuper: did u already run an ad?
[12.12.25, 14:07:11] ~ Rui Bessa: nop, setting up the account still
[12.12.25, 14:08:30] Topi: Earlier this year they banned anyone with advertorials so might want to check whats the current status
[12.12.25, 14:11:19] ~ Rui Bessa: yes..heard a lot of stories as well. thanks Topi…i will start with something SAFER..maybe a cleaner version of my pdp and see if i dont get banned
[12.12.25, 14:33:03] ~ Oscar: Hi guys, hope everyone is crushing it! 
I wanted to know if the shipping company's Yanwen and SF are good? Anyone has experience with these shipping company's?

Thanks
[12.12.25, 14:43:45] ~ Rui Bessa: Yanwen is good and reliable form my experience
[12.12.25, 14:46:51] China Bigboss: Hey depends what you ship and to where Yanwen is slow SF is good but their service and customer care is bad .. this from our experience with both of them
[12.12.25, 14:47:31] China Bigboss: For this time of the year it's a mess for all express company tbh
[12.12.25, 14:49:03] ~ Giovanni: In my opinion is too slow and I got more packages lost than with Yun
[12.12.25, 15:14:49] ~ MG Business: Yanwen is ight just takes forever bro
[12.12.25, 15:16:07] ~ Oscar: How long you've been using this shipping company? is it correct that they ship in 6-10 days to US? My product isn't big.
[12.12.25, 15:16:40] ~ Oscar: yeah it is, but i'm looking for an overall lower price and still good shipping of course
[12.12.25, 15:16:47] ~ MG Business: They’ve done 8-10 days consistently for me but it’s really 10-12 bc they have to process the shipment
[12.12.25, 15:17:03] ~ MG Business: But also I have customers emailing me saying their product been in Chicago for 2 weeks so idfk 😹😹😹
[12.12.25, 15:17:23] ~ Oscar: Hi, my main product weighs 120 grams so package isn't very heavy. 

How long was shipping for you?
[12.12.25, 15:17:51] ~ Oscar: okay got it, but i have everything in stock so they don't need to order it from their supplier first before shipping it out. ‎<This message was edited>
[12.12.25, 15:18:15] ~ Oscar: Yeah but that's probably because of this period man.
[12.12.25, 15:18:45] ~ Giovanni: That’s the most frustrating part 😂
[12.12.25, 15:19:08] ~ MG Business: Interesting yeah it’s def this time of year but I was getting 8-10 days +2 days process even in October but yeah they had to order it to their warehouse in china first
‎[12.12.25, 15:19:38] ~ Oscar: Yanwen.xls ‎document omitted
[12.12.25, 15:19:39] ~ Oscar: they did send me this so i can see the records of this shipping company.
[12.12.25, 15:19:43] ~ MG Business: Not order it but I guess get it from the other china warehouse 😹
[12.12.25, 15:19:57] ~ Giovanni: It’s very frustrating when the package did travel all over the world from China and then it gets stuck somewhere ‎<This message was edited>
[12.12.25, 15:20:07] ~ MG Business: Tell me about it😹
[12.12.25, 15:20:29] ~ Oscar: yeah exactly, they dropship also.
[12.12.25, 15:20:42] ~ MG Business: My product is a warmth product rn it’s like 10 degrees up north everybody emailing me saying their stuff stuck in Chicago and they cold😭
[12.12.25, 15:21:12] ~ MG Business: Crazy
[12.12.25, 15:23:36] ~ Erik: Some customers are difficult anyway. People email saying they've been waiting for weeks, but when you check when they placed their order, it was eight days ago😂
[12.12.25, 15:23:57] ~ Oscar: yeah that's soo true bro hahaha
[12.12.25, 15:24:33] ~ Oscar: i checked some of these orders and it does deliver pretty fast, i might just test it out and see how it is.
[12.12.25, 15:24:37] ~ Oscar: like just a couple orders.
[12.12.25, 15:24:59] ~ MG Business: My pops ordered some of my product initially to test yanwen and it did get there pretty fast
[12.12.25, 15:25:21] ~ MG Business: Bc he’s in a random part of US where I’m not
[12.12.25, 15:25:32] ~ MG Business: so it’s hit or miss would be the conclusion it seems
[12.12.25, 15:29:07] China Bigboss: To which country?
[12.12.25, 15:32:26] ~ Oscar: US, they say 6-10 days shipping with Yanwen and i just checked their records and the onces i looked at were all delivered in between those shipping times.
[12.12.25, 15:33:01] ~ Oscar: yeah might be.
[12.12.25, 15:33:20] ~ Oscar: also UK and Australia but they've given me the time for US now
‎[12.12.25, 15:42:13] ~ Akos: ‎image omitted
[12.12.25, 15:44:44] China Bigboss: Can do same almost some times 5-7 but not these days for sure
[12.12.25, 16:02:16] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Do any of you guys combine ad sets? Facebook keeps trying to push me to do and touts “73% overall better results” if I do it, but the organization in the campaign is going to become horrible if I do so
[12.12.25, 16:02:46] ~ Idan Gabbay: Hey friends, did anyone manage to tranfer shrine from one store to a new one including all templates etc ?
[12.12.25, 16:03:09] ~ MG Business: I’ve wondered the same thing but never done it. Supposedly it does that bc it’s having trouble testing diff angles
[12.12.25, 16:03:21] ~ Oscar: Yeah make sense, I’ll test it out and see! Thank you
[12.12.25, 16:04:25] ~ Oscar: Is it for having the same store in different language on a new Shopify account? Or is it just for having the shrine theme again without having to pay another subscription?
[12.12.25, 16:04:53] ~ Oscar: What do you mean with combining the adsets brother?
[12.12.25, 16:05:30] ~ Idan Gabbay: New store, based on other country, do not need the old store but first i need to migrate everything to the new store (no need for another subscription as i only need it active in one store eventually) ‎<This message was edited>
[12.12.25, 16:06:32] ~ Oscar: Don’t really know brother, I’m sorry. Never done that before 😓
[12.12.25, 16:21:53] ~ Eric Kashkevych: So each adset has different targeting and compete for the campaign budget. If I combine all of the ads into one mega adset, Facebook is saying I’ll get better results because the ads will work together and not against eachother
[12.12.25, 16:39:32] ~ MG Business: Supposedly CBO’s are really good at distinguishing winners so I suppose it’s not a bad idea to try but maybe ask a coach
[12.12.25, 16:40:21] ~ danny: is it common to make landing pages with code ? first time doing it and tbh idk why i’ve never done this before
[12.12.25, 16:40:42] ~ danny: maybe i’m just a retard
[12.12.25, 19:33:29] ~ Marc F: how do you all posts vsls?
[12.12.25, 19:34:03] ~ Marc F: I have a 7 min video and Im getting an error after uploading it, but I think the weight limit is 4GB and Im below that so Im not sure what am I doing wrong
[12.12.25, 20:00:08] ~ MG Business: You can have AI build the code just will need to run it and smooth out any wrinkles a few time
[12.12.25, 20:01:04] ~ MG Business: By landing pages do you mean for VSLs?
[12.12.25, 21:09:19] ~ Igor Botelho: What’s good, gang?

I am currently running my site on Shopify with ads optimized for standard Meta CAPI Purchase event, but also use tracking via parameter in Hyros. I still see differences in the ads tracking side tho. Which one do you think is more reliable and accurate? Do you think Meta integration digs deeper than just first/last click? What is your experience? Thank you !!! 🙏

[14.12.25, 12:36:01] ~ Idan Gabbay: hey friends 

im currently setting up shopify payments under UK ltd business 

the thing is i do not see a place to upload a UK physical business proof utility statements,

in my personal residential address i have entered my personal address (outside the UK) and for the business address i have entered the actual UK address i have in the utility bill (just do not see a place to upload it)

have someone created shopify payments for uk ltd here and can help me understand what do i need here ? just afraid that a single mistake gonna get me just flagged
[14.12.25, 12:49:33] ~ JULIUS: Have you changed Country in the billing address ?

[14.12.25, 15:11:28] ~ L: With omega you can add more pixels
[14.12.25, 16:31:39] ~ Kim Romanov: Those are for you apps. You need web only for shopify

[14.12.25, 18:52:55] ~ L: What are the things you think wetracked do that omega doesnt?
[14.12.25, 18:53:04] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Might be a dumb question but why would you need a backup pixel? Is it if the ad account gets banned?

[14.12.25, 18:54:43] ~ Ziga: I have a specific setup that could lead to some problems
[15.12.25, 0:10:17] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, you recommend still scaling when the weekend is at the end? Tomorrow is monday, so might drop a little. 
The numbers are good so i'm thinking of scaling.
[15.12.25, 0:45:48] ~ Austin: I scale regrdless of the day….yes mondays can be worse and normally always are, but if the data looks health enough I personally do.
[15.12.25, 0:48:29] ~ Oscar: Okay appreciate it! I’ve scaled everything that was good!
[15.12.25, 0:49:28] ~ Oscar: I have a question for CBO. 

Currently I have a CBO for US but I also target Australia and UK. I have some winning ads for those countries, should I create a separate CBO for each country and put the winning ads from each country in their own CBO? ‎<This message was edited>
[15.12.25, 0:50:52] ~ Ariel Gaona: Hey everyone, does anyone have a good time tracker tool or software they use so I can use it for myself one that I can see on a clean dashboard and basically time audit myself while I work
[15.12.25, 1:05:49] ~ Oscar: I use a white board and set my to do list on there. I don’t schedule my time. I just get the things done as fast as possible and I can scrape them off on the white board. 

If I’m done I add more! Timing for me is hard because sometimes it takes longer than other times but yeah if it works for you than go for it but I don’t have a really good software.
[15.12.25, 1:06:21] ~ Ariel Gaona: I use notion already but I’m talking an actual dashboard with a clean time tracker software
[15.12.25, 1:06:25] ~ Ariel Gaona: That’s meant for that yk
[15.12.25, 1:06:56] ~ Oscar: Yeah gotcha, I don’t know brother I’m sorry.

[15.12.25, 9:12:15] ~ Giovanni: I always remove them before publishing
[15.12.25, 9:26:04] ~ L: Wait what ? How did you find out?
[15.12.25, 9:26:32] ~ seth: I launched image and see that it have average video play time
[15.12.25, 9:26:49] ~ seth: then i breakdown in Creative > Related media
[15.12.25, 9:27:01] ~ seth: 90% budget was spent in that not my img creative
[15.12.25, 9:27:15] ~ Lana: How can you turn that off?

[15.12.25, 9:27:29] ~ L: Interesting, how did u turn it off
[15.12.25, 9:27:32] ~ seth: have to go in ads and turnoff manually
[15.12.25, 9:27:53] ~ seth: but the things is i never set it up
[15.12.25, 9:28:05] ~ Lana: Yes but where exactly is it? I havent even heard of such

[15.12.25, 14:15:55] ~ Kim Romanov: For some unclear reason the issue is with our theme
[15.12.25, 14:19:14] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, i'm about to make a big purchase again for my stock. What do you suggest me to do? of course not 50/50 because i need cashflow to be able to scale further.
[15.12.25, 14:19:34] ~ Oscar: what do you guys usually do for buying the stock?
[15.12.25, 14:32:03] ~ Eric Kashkevych: I have usually have 30/70
[15.12.25, 14:32:43] ~ Eric Kashkevych: 70 I pay when the order fulfills

[16.12.25, 4:56:44] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Alright I’ll take a look at what they use
[16.12.25, 5:57:54] ~ seth: I see most people do checkout champ if they have performance funnel seperate from shopify
[16.12.25, 5:59:41] ~ seth: if run quiz to shopify checkout then should use their app, i see most brand i follow use Octane something not remember the name correctly
[16.12.25, 6:02:45] ~ Drew Cable: If you need direct PayPal accounts for Checkout Champ let me know.

I’ve loved Arcads but they’ve basically doubled in price since the script length has been cut in half per credit used.
[16.12.25, 19:58:54] ~ Oscar: is it for long videos like UGC?
[16.12.25, 20:02:21] ~ Ariel Gaona: Veo 3 with the image to video or frame to video feature gets you perfect character consistency with unlimited creations if you use the normal model it charges 0 credits

Feel free to join! 🙂
[17.12.25, 19:51:08] ~ Colby: Anyone have trouble getting meta to spend on the correct age? Every time I want to test something that should be towards like 40 year old women. It decides to spend all the budget on 65+ even though in the copy and everything it’s talking about a specific 40 year old. And my conversions are from 40 year olds
[17.12.25, 19:52:43] ~ Colby: Really annoying because I can’t tell if something works or not since it’s spending it to the wrong people. Is it normal for it to do this and you just have to let it learn ?
[17.12.25, 19:58:53] ~ MG Business: You can set age targeting
[17.12.25, 20:00:18] ~ MG Business: If there’s no set age target then meta came to a conclusion for now that it can get better value in different age groups, so maybe let it learn, but setting parameters would probably be a more direct and efficient way to reach that specific audience if that’s what you’re looking for. Dm me for help
[17.12.25, 20:00:53] ~ danny: how long does it usually take to learn on its own?
[17.12.25, 20:00:54] ~ MG Business: Esp if you’re using a new pixel or new ad account or a pixel from a diff niche or something
[17.12.25, 20:01:08] ~ danny: only been running for a week or so but testing with new ads
[17.12.25, 20:01:11] ~ MG Business: It depends how good your ads and website are to be honest. Videos accelerate learning for sure
[17.12.25, 20:01:24] ~ danny: i’ve always been told to not set any targeting
[17.12.25, 20:02:24] ~ MG Business: So have I. But in some ways I disbelieve it. If you’re testing then using some parameters may not be so bad. Then your pixel gets fed data on that exact audience pocket too
[17.12.25, 20:02:37] ~ MG Business: If you’re scaling or starting brand new I wouldn’t target. But sometimes it makes sense
[17.12.25, 20:03:11] ~ MG Business: I guess it really only makes sense if you wanna get data from a specific audience as Colby suggested
[17.12.25, 20:03:48] ~ danny: him and i are partners lol we’re doing same thing

Should I just launch them with new headlines + primary texts  in Jan or leave them be

[19.12.25, 9:29:21] ~ משרד: i heard it can happen due to page score bieng low

[22.12.25, 21:03:28] ~ Ilya: also would be curious about this
[23.12.25, 0:05:33] ~ Kim Romanov: Hi guys — looking for input from those who’ve dealt with U.S. e-commerce tax setups for nonresidents.

Situation:
	•	U.S. single-member LLC, treated as a disregarded entity
	•	I live outside the U.S. (currently tax resident in the UAE)
	•	No U.S. office/warehouse/employees/agents
	•	Inventory/fulfillment is outside the U.S. (primarily China)
	•	We’re registered for sales tax in 30+ states (economic nexus)

What I was advised before:
I’ve had multiple consultations over time, including with James Baker, CPA (well-known in e-commerce tax), Chris Rivera, plus another accountant, and the consistent view was:
	•	If there’s no U.S. trade or business / no ECI, then there’s no U.S. federal income tax at the owner level (I’d pay tax in my country of tax residency instead).
	•	I was also told that even using Amazon FBA (including inventory stored at Amazon warehouses) does not automatically create ECI, because I don’t have direct access to or control over Amazon’s warehouses (the facilities are owned/operated by Amazon).

What changed / the issue:
A new accountant is now saying I do have Effectively Connected Income (ECI) and therefore owe U.S. federal tax this year because:
	•	I collect/pay sales tax in 30+ states, and/or
	•	I do business with U.S. customers through a U.S. LLC, so “that alone” creates ECI.

Additional fact:
The only operational change vs last year is that at the end of December we moved some inventory toward Amazon/FBA, but we haven’t started selling/fulfilling from FBA yet — launch planned around Jan 1.

Questions for the group:
	1.	Has anyone here been told that sales tax registrations/economic nexus alone creates ECI / U.S. trade or business for a nonresident owner of a disregarded LLC?
	2.	For those using FBA as a nonresident, did your CPA/attorney treat inventory in Amazon warehouses as creating ECI/USTB, or not? What was the reasoning?
	3.	If you were challenged on ECI, what specific facts did the IRS/your advisors focus on (inventory ownership/location, fulfillment, agents, importer of record, title passage, etc.)?
	4.	Any recommended CPAs/attorneys who are truly solid on nonresident e-commerce + ECI?

Not looking for generic advice — I’m trying to sanity-check whether this accountant’s position is valid or a misunderstanding.

Thanks in advance.
[23.12.25, 0:09:47] ~ Allan L: I fucked up boys. My brand was doing 10k days with very healthy margin. 
I then launched a new campaign with tons of adsets (19) with a total of 120 ads. 
After that my performance dropped hard! And today Almost break even. (Going from like 40-50% roi.)

What the hell Can I do? I obviously paused the campaign again but it doesnt seem like the old campaigns is picking up.
[23.12.25, 0:16:52] ~ Oscar: Maybe it needs some day to optimise brother? It’s a lot of new ads that you’ve ran with a lot of adsets and maybe it needs to stabilise again and than it will turn around again?
[23.12.25, 0:20:14] ~ Allan L: It kinda been like 10 days already tho
[23.12.25, 0:24:53] ~ Andreas: Anyone having issues with loading times for shopify pages on mobile?
Our page loads extremely slow or not at all on smartphones, our main source of traffic.
Our web engineer says he thinks it is somewhat connected to the recent shopify /cloudflare issues.
On desktop, loading time is ok-ish.

[23.12.25, 0:31:51] ~ Ilya: launching new ads might affect the performance of others?
[23.12.25, 0:31:52] ~ Ilya: crazy
[23.12.25, 0:32:44] ~ Eric Kashkevych: You turned off the old campaign? When launching the new one?
[23.12.25, 0:33:12] ~ Eric Kashkevych: And the old one was profitable?
[23.12.25, 0:53:00] ~ Allan L: No. Had 5 ongoing campaigns, did not turn them off. Performance just dropped. They are still running just with low performance atm.
[23.12.25, 1:07:13] ~ Oscar: ooh shit, that's not good than.
[23.12.25, 1:07:48] ~ Oscar: and the new ads aren't performing? That big batch?
[23.12.25, 7:37:38] ~ Andreas: About 2-3 weeks. We didn't notice immediately 😬
[23.12.25, 8:56:56] ~ David: made better experience with ABOs. Especially if you got a lot of vids meta will just pump way too much money in some of these, ignoring pics with profitable CPR / ROAS. Thats why we segmented Vids and Pics and simple adjust budget about ever 5-7 days, stabilizing CPR and ROAS.

[25.12.25, 3:36:02] ~ Reece Mander: I don't know a way around it once you breach 80k in sales. Or automatically if you hold stock in UK
[25.12.25, 4:47:49] ~ Devesh Jain: What happened brother
[25.12.25, 4:50:00] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Nah just the dip in sales cause of low buying intent atm
[25.12.25, 4:50:14] ~ Eric Kashkevych: I got too comfortable lol
[25.12.25, 8:26:08] ~ Luka: Run a end of year sale to boost sales
[25.12.25, 10:08:58] ~ David: but same here its insane
[25.12.25, 10:09:12] ~ David: yesterday was still okay but today is insanely low. -41%
[25.12.25, 10:10:28] ~ David: we gonna counter that by promoting sales to „get ready for 2026“, „attack the new year“ etc. by playing into the whole „new year new me“ angle. People want to change, 99% never do but they still buy the gym membership to feel good for example. same can be used for many products that can make a change in their lives.
[25.12.25, 14:08:30] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Good shit dude thank you I’m going to use that as my next angle awesome man
[25.12.25, 15:22:49] ~ Oscar: would you already start running that sale on the website? Like mentioning it?
[25.12.25, 16:16:59] ~ Abdulrauf Alhariri: Hi guys, I opened a new ad account for testing a new product. It’s already 3pm and the campaign didn’t spend anything and half the ads stuck at preparing and I had to relaunch some ads in the campaign that were stuck at in review state since the day before. Anyone experienced this?

Should I just duplicate the campaign and relaunch it at 12am
[25.12.25, 16:20:34] ~ David: How long has it been in that state? If you make big changes i. e. new campaign with many creatives, sometimes „preparing“ status will last for up to a whole day almost.
[25.12.25, 16:22:06] ~ Luka: Yes absolutely. You can even run the same BFCM offer for your end of year sale. Since the offer is already proven, it should work now too. We have it on the homepage, timers (real), etc
[25.12.25, 16:22:34] ~ Abdulrauf Alhariri: It’s been like that for almost 12 hours now, before that they were stuck at in review state for so long as well. Usually it takes a few minutes up to an hour but this is the first time it takes so long
[25.12.25, 16:26:00] ~ David: longest I had to wait was 18 or 20 hours, even though our Ad Account is running for 5 years now with no major problems ever. Sometimes the servers take some time, saw it during BF/CM. As long as you see some progress i. e. "in review“ -> preparing I would give it a few more hours before killing it and trying new. 

If you try new I would then start small with just a few harmless pics / carousels so you get something through, up and running and then add more ads more agressively. ‎<This message was edited>
[25.12.25, 16:27:36] ~ Luka: This. In my last quarterly meeting with Meta the meeting was primarily about Q5 (Jan). Low CPMs create an incredible opportunity. You should test pushing more of a “new year new me” messaging, sales, new years resolutions, habits etc.

For us, January is our 2nd best month behind December.
[25.12.25, 16:27:43] ~ Luka: Here’s some slides from the meeting that may be helpful
[25.12.25, 16:28:42] ~ Luka:

[25.12.25, 16:31:39] ~ Abdulrauf Alhariri: Do you recommend I let it until tomorrow but at the same time make a duplication of it and schedule it to midnight in case the original doesn’t spend or start delivering
[25.12.25, 17:11:07] ~ Calin: ‎Victor added ~ Calin
[25.12.25, 17:36:26] ~ Ilya: would you recommend using those ads as a retargeting for those who didn’t buy or just going for cold audience introducing your product to them as something new to try?
[25.12.25, 17:40:02] ~ Luka: Both. And then analyze performance
[25.12.25, 17:41:03] ~ Devesh Jain: Guys, does anyone have any info about the country and dates of upcoming mastermind?
[25.12.25, 18:59:09] ~ Khodor: Guys, any idea where i can learn more about Customer retention, increasing LTV without increasin CAC, lowering return rates and such on?
[25.12.25, 18:59:49] ~ Khodor: My retention rate is 30%, clothing brand, but interested in more loyalty and retention of customers
[25.12.25, 19:05:54] ~ Khodor: and which CRM i can use instead of Klaviyo that can be integrated with Shopify, with lower payment than klaviyo
[25.12.25, 19:16:38] ~ David: Hit the 24 hours, if it doesn’t move, plan B with fewer creatives. You can schedule second smaller campaign that shouldn’t be a problem
[26.12.25, 12:00:22] ~ B: Hey, anybody had an issue with Pixel going in Core setup, because of domain classified as Health & wellness? It stops tracking most of the events and the ads cannot optimize. Its a supplement brand. Im considering just changing the domain but Im afraid that it might still go into Core setup.
[26.12.25, 21:54:31] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Anyone have any ad agencies that they recommend? My account got hacked recently and Facebook support is taking too long
[26.12.25, 22:34:11] ~ .: ‎~ Barby removed ~ .
[26.12.25, 22:39:44] ~ David: Guys our ads were running in a pretty tight niche (like Bodybuilding) but in 2026 we want to expand to a connected, but way more brought niche (like „weight loss shakes“ but for everybody into health).

Since our ads are trained for the smaller niche, would you recommend doing a completely new campaign? Or just a new Ad set.
[26.12.25, 23:33:43] ~ Austin: Personally, I would just continue to throw everything into a single campaign. I like to do this so that way I can see which avatar Facebook finds to have the highest buying intent and affinity with our brands messaging.
[27.12.25, 5:40:05] ~ Luka: For Meta’s monthly invoicing - if we get the invoice on Jan 1 (NET-30 meaning due is Feb 1) and we clear 50% of the invoice right away, would it free up that amount from the credit limit? ‎<This message was edited>
[27.12.25, 5:42:57] ~ Santi Roa: Yes but I think you can do it only between the 3rd and 23rd of each month (using Credit card)
[27.12.25, 5:43:18] ~ Santi Roa: Otherwise yes, anytime you pay it frees up that amount from the credit line
[27.12.25, 6:58:08] ~ Luka: Can use credit card ? Thought it was limited to wire transfer only.
[27.12.25, 6:59:38] Matán Intsuper: I heard you can, but it still limits your spend per month, usually less than you’d need
[27.12.25, 8:05:21] Marek Olszewski: You can also make prepayments, eg your credit line is $1m, you have $0 due, you pay $500k, your limit increases to $1.5m and the $500k is marked as prepayment
[27.12.25, 8:09:11] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Holy shit I am a fly amongst giants rn
[27.12.25, 8:12:22] ~ Ariel Gaona: My thoughts exactly
[27.12.25, 8:27:56] ~ Luka: This would be great for us right now. We scaled and are nearing our limit so I’d love to pay in advance however how do you do it? Usually they require to provide the invoice # in the payment. Our rep is on holiday atm so can’t ask her
[27.12.25, 8:37:29] ~ Steph: Does anyone have a excellent video editor they can recommend? Specifically looking for someone to make ecom YouTube videos.
[27.12.25, 8:40:17] ~ Finn Aurel Schlarb: Dm me
[27.12.25, 9:59:27] Marek Olszewski: instead you provide your ad acc number in the wire memo, in the email with payment receipt include your CL BM id and your ad acc id, they should reconcile it within 2-3 days
[27.12.25, 12:53:19] ~ Luka: Awesome thanks - didn’t know this was possible. Will send a pre-payment then
[27.12.25, 16:00:15] ~ Santi Roa: Yes there’s a hack to do it, can only be done between the 3rd and 23rd of each month. And it increases the limit (for example if your limit is 500k and you spent 450k already, you can pay with card the 450k and it will go down to 0 so you can keep spending)

Do you have someone who can help?ì
[27.12.25, 18:45:06] ~ Cocow: No shipper ? 🤣 wtf

[27.12.25, 22:34:48] ~ John B: Yes, I’m not a big fan, you don’t get to see what the page looks like at all so you won’t know what is working besides the product it chooses. No control over the messaging, headlines etc, it performed solid for me, but I’d prefer to have control and learn what it is doing.
[27.12.25, 22:40:31] ~ Ewen Garrigue: Hey everyone, I tried to apply for an Amex credit card but got refused. I think it’s because I’m too young (18). Does anyone know a way to get accept at my age?
[27.12.25, 22:48:53] ~ John B: You can ask your parents if they’d be willing to open one under their name, but then you’d be responsible for connecting bank account to pay it off ofc. Assuming they have aged credit score and history, this will also give you a much higher spending limit than you would have gotten. If you don’t have a credit card, def open one up like a discover card to start getting your credit up then you can get an amex in a few months for sure.
[27.12.25, 23:14:09] ~ Mathias Bo: good to know, thanks G
[28.12.25, 2:30:24] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Hoping one of the giants here can answer this. How much more do you recommend partnering with an ad agency over having your own account? I’d really appreciate it because idk if I should keep waiting for Facebook support to fix the issue I’m having right now.
[28.12.25, 5:17:50] ~ Luka: Perfect for Amex pts. Would it also be possible for a partial payment? Instead of full 450k, we pay 250k first ?
[28.12.25, 12:15:05] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, anyone here that has some tips for building a good structure for testing new angles, new target groups. Keeping everything organised and nowing your data super well so you know what works and what doesn't? 

I'm thinking of making a spreadsheet but don't really now how to build it up and make it simple but very effective. 

All the help is appreciated!
[28.12.25, 12:16:08] ~ Oscar: also, does it effect your ad account/ campaign if you delete the adsets that you turned off? I assume it doesn't?
[28.12.25, 12:21:44] ~ Cocow: Why would you do that ? Work with filters. Keep your data if you can for example for tools taking your advertising spends for costs , etc …
[28.12.25, 12:22:57] ~ Cocow: You can work with naming conventions rename your adsets , ads to get a naming structure , then you can compare with tools like Attria working with tags. But careful with all of this you ads complexity you really have to make sure you will use this data ‎<This message was edited>
[28.12.25, 12:30:59] ~ Oscar: Yeah I haven’t deleted them ever, but it’s getting messy. But I’ll set up filters that will allow me to have a better view!
Thanks
[28.12.25, 12:32:02] ~ Oscar: Okay got it, I do name the adsets specifically. 
But I’m more looking for a kind of sheet where I fill in all the data information and things I’ve tested etc to keep a good eye over it. 

Do you use something like that or not?
[28.12.25, 13:43:07] ~ Num: Hey guys Today my ad account did not track purchases, even after contacting WeTracked. They told me it happened because my pixel was flagged as “health/medical” which restricts purchase tracking. Has anyone experienced this before? How can I fix it?
Thank you.
[28.12.25, 17:28:07] ~ Cocow: I personally don’t , but you can for sure 

Check as well the report function on Facebook. It can at least prepare you the data nicely and then if you want you can export on excel and copy paste in sheet. But personnaly not using it :)
[28.12.25, 17:42:10] ~ Oscar: Okay thanks a lot mate, I’ll do those reports for sure!

I’ll figure a system out just for myself.

Thanks a lot
[28.12.25, 17:56:39] ~ Ilya: I’ve been doing something like that for some time
[28.12.25, 18:06:13] ~ Ilya: I have a full spreadsheet setup. I want to improve it though, it wasn’t that effective the way I did it
[28.12.25, 21:28:17] ~ MG Business: Sup mates I’m starting and building from scratch does anyone have any creative process or books they can recommend to me?
[28.12.25, 21:28:53] ~ MG Business: I know ideas don’t come out of thin air but I want to move away from drop shipping and into a real deal business
[29.12.25, 0:46:03] ~ Ariel Gaona: Do you guys have a number or rep to call for weird charges on your ad accounts
[29.12.25, 1:12:58] ~ David: The Creative Act by Rick Rubin

We all are creators already, we are simply limited by our own second thoughts + all the noise out there. 

Also read the Alchemist by Paolo Coelho. 

2 Books that changed my life and approach to business. Applicable to so many things.
[29.12.25, 2:04:27] ~ Santi Roa: - Blue ocean strategy: I don’t have words to explain this book, it will teach you to understand how one can disrupt a market, building its own reality by picking the right things to differentiate and compete
[29.12.25, 2:05:13] ~ MG Business: Thank you santi and David books help me more than anything I appreciate it!!
[29.12.25, 2:38:48] ~ David: btw you can get 99% of books out there for free here:

https://oceanofpdf.com
[29.12.25, 3:59:04] ~ Santi Roa: Or you can pay so the people that put years of work into the books get some small amount of money
[29.12.25, 3:59:14] ~ Santi Roa: Btw I used to download books free online haha
[29.12.25, 3:59:51] ~ Santi Roa: But now after making millions, I feel bad about the books that gave me the knowledge. I started buying a few of each to give away
[29.12.25, 4:00:31] ~ Abrianna D’Orazio: Also on eBay they’re like $5-$10
[29.12.25, 4:00:50] ~ Eric Kashkevych: I’ll be glad to offload some of them for you 😂😂
[29.12.25, 4:01:03] ~ Santi Roa: So I’d say if you have 10 bucks to spend, buy it. Life will pay you back
[29.12.25, 4:23:49] ~ Asad: Sales tax and income tax are separate concepts.

Collecting sales tax in U.S. states does not automatically mean you owe U.S. federal income tax.

For non U.S. owners, U.S. income tax is driven by where the business actually operates. This typically depends on where inventory is located, where orders are fulfilled from, and when sales activity begins. It is not determined solely by having U.S. customers or a U.S. LLC.

Amazon FBA is the primary area to watch. Once inventory in U.S. warehouses is actively fulfilling orders, U.S. tax exposure can begin. Timing is important. Inventory that has not yet started fulfilling sales is often treated differently.

I would ask each advisor to point to the specific case law or precedent they are relying on so you can understand how they are reaching their conclusion.
[29.12.25, 4:28:26] ~ Asad: I pretty much align with James and Chris on this one since there is a timing difference between inventory being moved to FBA and actual fulfillment happening after the tax year. But always good to have reference on precedence and case law on how each advisor reached their conclusions.

CPC si the same (I have better CTR), but conv. rate is -1% .. do you have similar results or it is just me? Is it because of Andromeda? I tried old ads, new ads, and it has similar results

[1.01.26, 22:52:21] ~ Farhat Godil: Hello everyone - What testing campaign structure is currently working for you guys? I am doing One Testing CBO with multiple adsets and one scaling CBO with one adset and multiple winning ads which show potential from testing campaign - This structure is not giving consistent results ‎<This message was edited>
[1.01.26, 23:54:48] ~ David: Whenever you pool different formats (Pics, Vids, Carousels, this new dynamic feature where you can mix it even inside the ad) results will be inconsistent. Because meta priorities videos always (as long as they aren’t ultra bad). 

For testing I would run an ABO and have dedicated ad sets for pics, vids, carousels. 

The winner ads will then outperform the others within the ad sets and you can move them to your scaling campaign.
[1.01.26, 23:55:26] ~ David: CBO only makes sense if you want to test different angles, not the ads themselves. Then I would run CBO and have different AdSets, each one dedicated to an angle.
[2.01.26, 0:37:07] ~ Farhat Godil: Thank you I will try this

[2.01.26, 14:56:37] ~ Erik: Hey guys!
I’m about to outsource my video ad creatives and I want to do this the right way.
For those who already went through this:
– What are your best practices? Do's and donts
– Any mistakes to avoid?
– What platforms to search for video editors or maybe you can recommend one?
All insights are highly appreciated 👊
[2.01.26, 15:09:53] ~ Oscar: make sure your SOP is organised and simple to manage, i can recommend a video editor of mine. Text me brother!

[2.01.26, 18:43:29] ~ Ilya: guys how would you go about testing the first product image? I feel like it affects CVR quite a lot and I want to put more premium image of the product there but I want to see how it works

Should I just change it and see how CVR changes over the next 7 days?
[2.01.26, 18:49:50] ~ Cocow: Use intelligems , or ab tasty for example 

Yes first image you cannot immagine the  effect on conversion this is huge 

And careful , premium does not mean better conversion.

Doing the switch 7 days and check unfortunately will give you 0 answers because there are seasonality , ads performance , etc … that changes the results from a week to another ‎<This message was edited>

[4.01.26, 2:44:26] ~ Santi Roa: This is probably affiliate marketing. The guys at HIYA are paying commissions to the people at “thecustomerdigest”, and they did a side by side comparison with competitors

Would really like to hear the different strategies there are in regards to media buying

We took one of our own internal owned brands from ~$300/day → $75k/day in 58 days using only Google Ads.

No FB. No TikTok. Just clean structure + execution.

What moved the needle:
* Geo-based campaign segmentation (US/CA focus)
* Aggressive PMax + feed-only setups
* Product variant testing inside Shopping
* Demand Gen + remarketing layered properly

End result: $1.2M revenue, ~4x ROAS.

Sharing the full breakdown here 👇

This is exactly why we run our own brands, we test first, then roll out what actually works.

I’m Looking for an E-commerce Growth Manager for a D2C brand. Not a media buyer — need someone who can actually run the whole growth engine.

You'd be doing funnel strategy (advertorials, VSLs, listicles), writing direct-response copy, running CRO/A/B tests, doing competitor research, and giving strategic direction on paid media (mainly Meta).

Need 3+ years in D2C (not Amazon), experience managing $50k+/mo in ad spend, and solid skills in funnels, copywriting, and analytics. English fluency required.

Compensation 3K-5K per month + Bonuses.

Shoot me a message if you are interested or know someone who might be a good fit.

[8.01.26, 14:01:08] ~ L: Guys, maybe someone can help: We just had our PayPal account banned forever. We have another LLC that we can use to open a new PayPal account, but I’m still the owner.

How do I manage the risk of getting banned again? Is this a real risk, or does PayPal not care once the entity is different? Is there anything from your experience that I should be aware of?
[8.01.26, 15:48:26] ~ David Stellato: For PayPal, they will link the two if it is the same owner, address, etc.  Your best bet would be to setup a new entity under a new owner with a new address and all contact details.  You must also use a new domain for it as the if you set it up on the domain with the banned account it will automatically link it as well.  Let me know if you have more questions here.

[8.01.26, 20:13:50] Topi: I dont think thats true at all, sell good products and you can scale with any paypal (based on experience). If you get crazy holds you can ask a lawyer to open them.
[8.01.26, 20:14:20] Topi: Why would paypal not let you do business if youre not a risk?
[8.01.26, 20:14:21] Topi: does not make any sense
[8.01.26, 20:14:39] Topi: And why would HK paypal let you scam or do fraud
[8.01.26, 20:26:07] ~ Calin: No ofc not.

They just tolerate higher chargeback %. I dont rlly think ecom stores that get closed paypal accounts do fraud. Paypal is just really picky
[8.01.26, 20:26:42] ~ Calin: And with HK paypal you have insiders aswell that can help you. With regular paypal you can get shut down if you have only slightly over 1% chargeback rate
[8.01.26, 20:48:01] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Hey guys someone finally copied my website/ad angle, is it possible to DMCA them?
[8.01.26, 21:00:08] ~ Drew Cable: Calin makes some great points and it really comes down to government and banking/card regulations in each specific country and how driven they are to bring new commerce especially from residents of other countries. That can drive the difference thresholds and experiences.

I sell products directly to my customers on Shopify, and Shopify collects the payments from customers on my behalf (via the connected payment method) and then transfers the net amount to my bank account as a payout after fees/refunds/chargebacks if any.

Since Shopify is a sales platform and the payouts are aggregated settlements, Shopify does not issue an “official payout certificate” per transfer.

To support the source of funds, I am attaching:
	•	invoices issued to my customers for the relevant period, and
	•	(if needed) a payout/export report from Shopify showing the payout date and the underlying orders.

Please let me know if you need any additional information (e.g., store URL, order list, or monthly summary).
[9.01.26, 20:38:37] ~ Tóth Áron: Always be as transparent with the banks as possible
[9.01.26, 20:39:39] ~ Giovanni: Thank you so much! So you sent them thousands of invoices?
[9.01.26, 20:40:06] ~ Tóth Áron: 3 invoices are more then enough as an official proof
[9.01.26, 20:41:44] ~ Giovanni: Ok got it thank you
[9.01.26, 21:32:07] ~ Igor Botelho: What’s good, gang? Happy New Year!

[9.01.26, 23:10:53] ~ Calin: Does anyone here own a Hong Kong company or has experience with oceanpayments or payoneer?
[9.01.26, 23:11:22] ~ Nass: Disputifier got hacked

Uninstall 

Stores are getting auto refunded
[9.01.26, 23:11:26] ~ Nass: @⁨Alex  Fedotoff⁩
[9.01.26, 23:16:07] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): If anyone needs help actioning Disputifier alerts as the website is down and Disputifier has stopped all refunds (including for alerts), please reach out to me or @⁨~Aima⁩ and we can get our team of 20 refund analysts to handle all alerts for your store by hand
[9.01.26, 23:16:34] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Any Chargeblast merchants - please uninstall the Disputifier app from your store immediately to prevent the impact or mitigate the situation
[9.01.26, 23:16:45] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): We work with OceanPayments
[9.01.26, 23:21:52] ~ Calin: Do y’all have a hongkong company?
[9.01.26, 23:22:17] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): We’ve been in communication with OceanPayments on using our chargeback prevention alerts
[9.01.26, 23:22:28] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): So we are in contact with the folks that run OceanPayments
[9.01.26, 23:37:56] ~ Calin: Got it
[10.01.26, 0:05:51] ~ Nicolas: Can you send where you got the info from? We also use disputifier
[10.01.26, 0:06:05] ~ Nass: Check X bro it’s been a thing now
[10.01.26, 0:06:25] ~ Nicolas: im not on X 😅
[10.01.26, 0:07:25] ~ Mark Wagner: Mark here, founder of Disputifier.  We recently learned of a isolated disruption within our system. Upon discovery, we immediately began working with our IT staff and third-party forensic specialists to commence a thorough investigation of the nature and scope of this incident. Please know that our team is diligently working around the clock to resolve this disruption and to minimize service interruptions wherever possible.
We appreciate your patience as we continue to investigate this matter.  We will provide additional information as soon as we are able.  To our knowledge, this issue is currently contained as we have temporarily disabled the ability for refunds to be processed from our app and changed API tokens.   If you were impacted, we highly recommend that you contact Shopify Payments or your payment processor to stop any refunds that were processed. It is important that you do this as soon as possible.   You can reach out to me directly (+1 9193206869 or mark@disputifier.com). Although information is limited at this time, we will share updates as they become available.
There is currently no action needed from you to prevent this from occurring on your store. Again, based on our current knowledge, we believe the issue has been contained at this time.
[10.01.26, 0:09:21] ~ Rui Bessa: @⁨~Mark Wagner⁩This is only for shopiffy payments ?
[10.01.26, 0:09:34] ~ Calin: Does disputifier work for klarna or only card?
[10.01.26, 0:12:24] ~ Nicolas: alerts only for card i think.
[10.01.26, 0:13:38] ~ Mark Wagner: It impacted the shopify app only but not necessarily only shopify payments. Please note only 4 known stores are impacted of 15K+ active merchants
[10.01.26, 0:22:35] ~ Steph: Appreciate you jumping in here Mark, tough situation but thanks for addressing it quickly. For merchants caught in the middle, if you need a backup for alerts/chargeback protection, Disputely.com can step in if needed.
[10.01.26, 0:28:56] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Nah
[10.01.26, 0:28:59] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Get out of here Disputely
[10.01.26, 0:29:02] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): Use Chargeblast instead
[10.01.26, 0:29:07] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): We are the 3rd largest provider with best prices
[10.01.26, 0:29:28] ~ Qi (Chargeblast): I am the founder and CEO of Chargeblast so you’d work directly with me
[10.01.26, 0:33:03] ~ Ryan Kamal: Most expensive prices*

[10.01.26, 0:34:40] ~ Ryan Kamal: No thanks I don’t want to pay $40 for RDR brodie
[10.01.26, 0:34:45] ~ Ryan Kamal: 🤣
[10.01.26, 0:35:09] ~ Ryan Kamal: Disputely is $16 RDR
[10.01.26, 0:35:42] ~ Steph: Distasteful.

[10.01.26, 1:51:01] ~ Ilya: sorry I was talking about the hong kong company. I still use normally shopify checkout
[10.01.26, 1:51:06] ~ Ilya: no ocean payments
[10.01.26, 2:51:29] ~ Farhat Godil: I am not able to login to my disputifier account. Is anyone facing the same issue? It says my account does not exist ‎<This message was edited>
‎[10.01.26, 2:57:59] ~ Matthew Martorano: ‎image omitted
[10.01.26, 4:17:07] ~ Santi Roa: We didn’t remove it and weren’t affected
[10.01.26, 4:17:22] ~ Santi Roa: So I assume it’s all under control now
[10.01.26, 4:19:05] ~ Ariel Gaona: In the panic I removed it and I think I lost all tokenization of previous orders and now I’m kinda screwed
[10.01.26, 4:20:09] ~ Ariel Gaona: @⁨~Mark Wagner⁩ is there a way to get all previous order tokenized so that they are covered by disputifier before I uninstalled in the panic
[10.01.26, 4:20:40] ~ Ariel Gaona: We’re at like $50k-100k/day rn and lowkey might cook us if I can’t get this fixed :(
[10.01.26, 5:03:52] ~ Calin: Sent you a DM
[10.01.26, 6:43:06] ~ 🥇: One of my friends was using Disputifier and deleted it after knowing about the hack issue. Now he’s unsure whether chargeback alerts will still be refunded automatically. He tried switching to another app, but was told that the enrollment is still active with Disputifier. For those who were using Disputifier, what did you do in this situation to keep handling alerts?
[10.01.26, 6:43:35] ~ Ariel Gaona: Bro literally suffering from the same problem
[10.01.26, 6:43:38] ~ Ariel Gaona: Looking for a solution
[10.01.26, 6:44:01] ~ Ariel Gaona: I think all past orders lost tokenization once disputifier was uninstalled
[10.01.26, 6:44:27] ~ Ariel Gaona: I’m waiting for mark to get back to see what can be done because I need to get all past order synced up to still automatically refund
[10.01.26, 6:45:20] ~ Farhat Godil: In the same boat
[10.01.26, 8:20:00] ~ Mark Wagner: Uninstalling disputifier will not impact tokenization of cards, don't worry
[10.01.26, 8:20:02] ~ Mark Wagner: Please feel free to DM me with any questions or concerns. We greatly appreciate your patience and support and are committed to restoring normal operations as soon as possible. In the meantime, your chargeback alert coverage will not be impacted as long as we have collaborator access. If you removed your Disputifier collaborator account, please DM me so I can get this setup again
[10.01.26, 9:00:34] Matán Intsuper: What a rollercoaster! Good luck with everything!

[10.01.26, 16:36:05] ~ Mathias Bo: Guys, which app do you recommend for translating your store from example german into englisch? Including the checkout in shopify?
[10.01.26, 16:43:26] ~ David: There are many apps out there, we use the Shopify one „Translate & Adapt“. While it only allows up to 4 different languages, we noticed that the flow on the website was the most seamless one. 

But this was before Shopify automated geolocation about a year ago, so others might be more relevant today
[10.01.26, 16:56:10] ~ Mathias Bo: does that app also translate the checkout? 

Because for my landing pages and Product pages I can translate manually, as I also have to change the messaging in the copy.  So that is not the problem
[10.01.26, 17:04:15] ~ David: Yes
[10.01.26, 17:04:29] ~ David: good thing is you can also „translate“ images and vids in case you got vids with voiceovers or images with text
[10.01.26, 18:59:02] ~ Dryden Byrd: Anyone have a fire P&L template I can use?
[11.01.26, 0:17:11] ~ Mathias Bo: Hey Guys, does anyone here have a swipefile, of validated advertorials, that are currently crushing? Especially in the weightloss Nische, but does not really matter
[11.01.26, 2:09:31] ~ Ewen Garrigue: Hey guys,

Slightly uncomfortable asking this, but I’ll be transparent.
I’m running a Shopify store from France — sales are consistent, but a 10% rolling hold on Shopify Payments is creating a short-term cash issue.

I also got declined for Amex, so I’m exploring private short-term loans / bridges to get through this gap.

If anyone here is open to lending short-term, It will be very nice.

Thanks and sorry for asking 🙏
[11.01.26, 4:40:52] ~ Steph: I'd use Shopify markets if the reason you want the translator is for advertising to English speaking countries @⁨~Mathias Bo⁩
[11.01.26, 6:07:34] ~ Calin: Does anyone here have experience with payment gateway CartDNA?
[11.01.26, 7:27:41] China Bigboss: Hey steph It was one of the best experiences we had ever with you guys thank you for giving us the opportunity to fulfill these orders Let's crash 2026🚀🚀

[11.01.26, 8:14:49] ~ Ed Anstee: Hi does anyone know good agency ad account companies?
[11.01.26, 8:16:20] ~ Steph: Meta or Google?
[11.01.26, 8:16:22] ~ Akshay: Yeah - been using their  agency accounts last couple of months - can connect you w them send me a dm
[11.01.26, 8:18:43] ~ Steph: Does anyone have a good VA/suport person they can put me in touch with?
[11.01.26, 9:48:04] ~ P: Yes
[11.01.26, 15:09:17] ~ Santi Roa: Hey Ewen, did you try Wayflyer?
[11.01.26, 20:44:29] ~ Calin: Is anyone here selling in the Netherlands, and knows a good way of getting IDEAL quickly?
[11.01.26, 20:45:51] ~ Gabriel Cassano: I sell there! Not sure the company setup you have but with UK LTD usually you get iDeal easily on Stripe
[11.01.26, 20:46:10] ~ Gabriel Cassano: Also with SP should be easy
[11.01.26, 20:52:35] ~ Erik: Yes, i do. Use Mollie. They also pay out the next day
[11.01.26, 20:53:02] ~ Adam Ashe: Hey all, I’m looking for a freak Shopify website designer/CRO specialist. Anyone got any reccos? Like this and I’ll message you privately 🙏
[11.01.26, 20:53:36] ~ Erik: Yep, unless you have a new store. Then its not possible anymore. Only after 90 days and 100 orders
[11.01.26, 20:55:21] ~ Oscar: Hey guys, does anyone know if Jacobo is active? I've send him three messages but he hasn't responded yet.
[11.01.26, 21:21:06] ~ Calin: Is it easy to set up a UK LTD?
[11.01.26, 21:22:02] ~ Calin: And how does the tax structure look like? Currently have a Hongkong LTD
[11.01.26, 22:55:35] ~ Ewen Garrigue: Hey guys,

This feels a bit awkward to bring up again, but I’ll keep it straightforward.
I’m running a Shopify store from France, sales are steady, however the 10% rolling hold on Shopify Payments is causing a short-term cash flow constraint.

I was also declined by Amex, so I’m currently exploring private short-term lending options to bridge the gap.

If anyone here would be willing to help on a short-term basis, I’d really appreciate it.

Thank you guy’s
[12.01.26, 3:03:21] ~ Nicolas: I don’t know if 10% is so much that it should kill your cashflow
[12.01.26, 3:03:27] ~ Ilya: would you guys turn off the ad that is getting the majority of the spent in CBO campaign but dying? It went from 2 ROAS to 1.4 over the past 4 days. Still kinda profitable but I feel like I have better ads in the campaign that don’t get enough spent
[12.01.26, 3:04:09] ~ Nicolas: The rolling reserves are pretty much standard, so i recommend operating your business with these reserves in mind and not taking any financial risks for the time being
[12.01.26, 6:22:05] ~ David: Sometimes ads work as an introduction to your brand. They are prepping the potential customers for the sale which will then be achieved via a different ad shown later. We’ve had this sometimes, turning ”low performers“ off and all the sudden the whole ad set performance tanks. 

Must not be the case though, try it out. 

What also works is to just keep introducing winning ads that outperform the old winning ad. This way you don’t have to turn the ad off and it won’t overspend.

[12.01.26, 9:44:03] ~ seth: mines double althought cpc, cpm is better
[12.01.26, 9:58:22] ~ Gabriel Cassano: Yep!! DM me please, I will help you out with all that I know
[12.01.26, 10:01:30] ~ Adam Ashe: It’s a shambles over here. VAT is 20% on all sales if you’re selling in Europe. 25% corporation tax. A US LLC with the tax structure seems to be much more beneficial. Have a look at Ireland LLC. Only 12% corporation tax.
[12.01.26, 10:04:09] ~ Eric Kashkevych: I forgot who I was speaking to but I was advised to look into Gibraltar due to minimal corporate tax and minimal auditing
[12.01.26, 11:54:59] ~ Eric Kashkevych: Alright I put this into ChatGPT really quickly this is what I got:
Key tax advantages:
	•	No VAT, no sales tax, no capital gains tax, no inheritance tax — simplifies tax planning and reduces burdens.  ￼
	•	Corporate tax generally 15% on profits derived or accrued in Gibraltar, but territorial basis usually means profits from outside Gibraltar may not be taxed (effectively 0% for qualifying offshore income).  ￼
	•	No withholding tax on dividends, interest or royalties paid to non-residents.  ￼
	•	Potential 0% for qualifying foreign profit distribution under certain circumstances.  ￼

👉 Gibraltar is often chosen when you want a low-tax, EU-linked jurisdiction without VAT or capital gains tax, especially for international trading, holding, IP, and asset companies.
[12.01.26, 12:13:51] ~ Idan Gabbay: Probably akos, suggested gibaltar for me too - try shooting him a message
[12.01.26, 12:40:46] ~ Ed Anstee: hi guys what softwares do you use for accounting?
[12.01.26, 16:13:00] ~ Andreas: hey guys, we sell to some countries in their local currency; but we don't accept paypal in these countries (exchange fee of paypal is exorbitant). 
In shopify, it looks like you can pay with paypal, and you get "merchant does not accept your currency" pretty late in the process.
Anyone have this problem - how do you handle it?
There are shopify apps that can suppress paypal in checkout from defined countries, any experience with that?
[12.01.26, 16:33:08] ~ Tóth Áron: PayRules app

[12.01.26, 21:29:25] ~ Mathias Bo: question for the guys who have switched from shopify to funnelish, is it possible to use existing pages from gempages for example, and import them into funnelish? I would not like to build everything from scratch, I would rather like to use only the checkout of funnelish, and „import“ the rest if that is possible
[12.01.26, 21:31:39] ~ Will: I don’t think so, you can find cheap freelancers on fiverr or up work though
[12.01.26, 21:45:02] ~ Gabriel Cassano: It’s not possible indeed, Funnelish is super limited in integrations
